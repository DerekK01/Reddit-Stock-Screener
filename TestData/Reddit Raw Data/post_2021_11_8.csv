1,"11/08/2021, 23:47:53",GoPro ($GPRO) is extremely undervalued and maybe the next big gamma squeeze. 10X potential ,dougefresh09,"**Quick Summary:**

$GPRO continues to turn around well. The share price is lagging behind considerably. 

$GPRO is now pointing to a bright future, in which it becomes a world class content production ecosystem. I see a good 10X opportunity from here.

&amp;#x200B;

**ER Commentary:**

$GPRO stock has been declining in slow motion for 6 months now, just after reaching multi year highs. There has been ample space and time to second guess the long thesis, but as always, focusing on fundamentals has been and continues to be our north star. $GPRO Q3 ER is what turnaround dreams are made of. Management continues to execute wonderfully and $GPRO is well on its way to becoming a FCF machine, with most market participants looking the other way. We are well into oversold territory and much like $SPOT (deep dive) for the past few weeks, I would not be surprised to see a strong rebound in the share price coming up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights from the ER conference call:**

I am quite sure that Bryan McGee is now effectively running the company. Nick barely said anything during the conference call and it was mostly Bryan nailing it, specially in the Q&amp;A. When I initiated my position in $GPRO, it was largely due to an intuition that Bryan was / is a world class operator. I believe we are not far from this being evident. I see Bryan transitioning into a CEO role soon and Nick stepping down into a chairman role - this is already happening behind the scenes. Non-GAAP gross margin is up to 43.8%, up from 36.2% in Q3 2020. Thats a 20.99% YoY increase. Management says this is due to the growing success in the focus on premium hardware and the D2C shift, as I laid out in my deep dive.

$GPROs balance sheet is getting stronger, as it continues to yield a growing ability to produce cash. FCF is solid, at 166m$ in the TTM (15% of revenue).

Subscription biz is exploding. At the close of Q3, we had 1.34 million GoPro subscribers, representing 168% year-over-year growth, adding approximately 840,000 new GoPro subscribers since the close of Q3, 2020.

$GPRO clearly has pricing power now, with its street ASPs reaching 381$ in Q3, up 25% YoY. The mix of cameras with MSRPs of $300 and above, including our newly launched $499 MSRP HERO10 Black, grew to 98% of our Q3 camera rev. Focusing on premium hardware is not only driving margins, but is turning $GPRO into a solid inflation hedge.

$GPRO is now fundamentally efficient at listening to customers and giving them what they want in an efficient way. With R%D the leanest it has been since 2014, whilst ASPs continue to rise, I now have confidence that $GPRO has a culture optimized to continue making life easier for content creators. This alone is going to be of immense value going forward, as I will explain in the next section. The supply chain is OK, despite global shortages. Gopro.com and our retail partners will be stocked and ready for shoppers this holiday season. I do not know how they have done, but they seem to have worked out shortages very well. Quik App now has 168,000 subscribers. This seems harmless, but is quite relevant as I will also explain the next section. Subscribe for free

&amp;#x200B;

**Looking Ahead**

Valued at 1.476$B, you may agree with me that the company is considerably undervalued. You can check out my thoughts on the valuation in the deep dive. Moving on, I want to address a part of the long thesis that I have not seen my fellow longs take on yet, but that I believe will become the common narrative a year or two from now. The above are signs that $GPRO is effectively turning around, but what is actually happening is that the company is non-obviously becoming a world class content creation ecosystem. This is going to be very valuable because as you may know yourself, today quality content is cash.

As $GPRO continues to funnel hardware customers into its subscription service, it is effectively populating an avenue which goes much deeper than its hardware business. As a content creator, once you have captured raw footage with hardware, the rest of the work is mostly software driven. Turning raw footage into engaging content requires taking many small and cumbersome steps, including adding other raw materials such as music, that are quite fatiguing.

Beyond populating this avenue, $GPRO is taking baby steps to solve the pains that content creators experience in the second half of content production, such as the launch and iteration of its Quik App, which enables easy editing and distribution on social media. This is still in the early phases, much like Bryan running the company a year or two ago, but we are heading in this direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**What gives me confidence that $GPRO is going to get there is:**

(1) Its resilience in getting back from mistakes in the past.

(2) Its now demonstrated ability to give customers what they want in a cost effective way.

\#2 paves the way for continued execution to make content editing and distribution easier through time, which in time is going to materialize as an ecosystem that makes creators lives way easier and hence, will make $GPRO far more valuable than it is today. I believe we will see this pop into plain sight in the next 8-12 months.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpgcu7/gopro_gpro_is_extremely_undervalued_and_maybe_the/

Iv been heavily watching ASO the last few months and I think they are set for giant gains once these shorts are covered. With a PE ratio of 8.3 and consistently beating earning this stock is ready to explode. It reported EPS of $2.34 vs the $1.54 estimate. They have gained 124% since IPO and earning expecting at $6.36 a share which is a 15% change in revenues.  Its been rough with such low volume trading its been hard for the people who see value in this stock because the shorts keep bringing the price down as soon as any real gains are made. 

They are consistently sitting around $45-$46 with a price target of $54. With a Zacks Rank of A and rated the second best stock in IBD's retail leisure group we should be seeing blue skies. Also ASO was being help down due to supply chain issues over the last several month but with that seeming to ease up and slowly getting better ASO will be set. Lots of retail stocks like TGT, WMY, DKS and ASO are looking to benefit from the easing of supply chain issues. 

Looks like the majority of shorts till next earnings need to be covered by this Friday. Im looking forward to some real gain once these shorts are done and the volume increases. Iv notice more active volume with all the news that is buzzing around ASO but not enough to really make a difference.

* PFE and BNTX share covid vaccine revenues.
* PFE covid vaccine revenue in Q2: $7.8B
* PFE covid vaccine revenue in Q3 (reported last week during earnings): $13B. A **67% increase**.
* BNTX revenue in Q2: $6.4B
* BNTX revenue *analyst estimate* in Q3: $5.9B. That's right. Current average analyst estimate is **less** than last quarter. The current estimate is wayyyy low.
   * My estimate for BNTX revenue in Q3: $6.4B \* 1.67 = $10.68B, AKAA a **HUGE revenue beat**.
   * This company's margins are a zillion percent. AKA a **BLOWOUT earnings beat**.
   * I cross-checked this approach with Q1 as well
* Earnings will be released **tomorrow (Tuesday)**
* After earnings, the p/e ratio should drop from 12 to **5**. By comparison, SPX and MRNA both have a p/e ratio of 30.
* Based on Pfizer's investor presentation for **agreed upon contracts** in 2022 I have calculated an (estimated) **LOWER BOUND** for BNTX's balance sheet EOY 2022.
   * Current balance sheet: $6.5B
   * Q3 + Q4: 9.5B in after-tax earnings
   * 2022: 11.4B in after-tax earnings
   * =27.6B on the balance sheet EOY 2022- LOWER BOUND. THIS IS ROUGHLY 50% OF THE CURRENT MARKET CAP

If we get a CDC recommendation for a yearly COVID shot for even a subset of the population, which is seeming more likely given waning immunity and Nancy Pelosi's husband's portfolio, then by EOY 2022 you will see BNTX sitting on roughly 30B in cash, with forward earnings somewhere in the ballpark of 10B per year. In that scenario I put BNTX baseline market cap at $180B- **3.2x TIMES WHERE IT IS NOW, NOT INCLUDING CONSIDERATION FOR ANY FUTURE PRODUCTS**.

I say this as a former Moderna shareholder who rode it from $50 to $320 and has great respect for them as a company. BNTX is hugely undervalued compared to MRNA, and the only reason MRNA market cap is so high is because MRNA is getting massively delta-hedged long from SPY and QQQ inflows and short-term call options (BNTX is not in SPY or QQQ because it's a European company). If MRNA falls, so too will its allocation within SPY and QQQ, putting additional downward pressure on the share price, and it will not bounce the way BNTX can due to underlying fundamentals. So yes, as inflation picks up and people peel off their retirement ETFs to buy their $57 turkeys, one possible trade is to short MRNA with puts and go long BNTX with calls expiring Jun 2022 or Jan 2023.

Did I mention the folks at BNTX are some really smart people using mRNA tech to try to cure cancer? Basically, they take a sample of a tumor, make a custom mRNA vaccine that will produce antibodies against that patient's tumor. mRNA vaccines are a new technology with an insane amount of untapped potential, COVID just opened the spigot, and **BNTX is at the forefront with a** **proven track record**. More vaccines will come, which will make more money. I say this with a healthy dose of moderate expectations- this company actually has the expertise and potential to cure cancer.

1,"11/08/2021, 23:20:08",Why Lucid Group will be a huge success NO MATTER WHAT.,Puzzleheaded-Ad436,"For those that are unaware because they are blinded by their love for video game and movie stocks, but Electric Vehicles are just now beginning their race. Tesla and Elon Musk are undoubtedly the common EV manufacturer. I doubt anything will change Tesla's position as the bulk EV manufacturer for quite some time.

Lucid just put their cars on the road for the first time a week ago. Let's compare Lucid's top model to Tesla's to get an understanding of what this company has to offer the consumer.

________________

Tesla Model S Plaid: 

396 mile range, 0-60mph in 1.99 seconds, 200mph top speed, 1020 hp.

Price: $124,490.

_________________

Lucid Dream Edition R:

520 mile range, 0-60 in 2.5 seconds, 933 hp, 168 mph.

Price: $168,000

________________

For anyone with half witted sense of reality, what this means is that Lucid's top vehicle out ranges Tesla's by over 100 miles! The range EVs can go before needing juice is the BIGGEST drawback to EVs!

Lucid also has a base model. The Air Pure. It is $77,000 and has a range of 406 miles.

Which brings me to my major point.

Let's say, hypothetically, that Rawlinson and his team can't make cars for shit.

They're absolutely incompetent and their cars suck. This of course ISN'T the case. Reviews of the first order of cars is that they are fantastic vehicles.

These guys already make a better BATTERY than Tesla!

And its so important that we as consumers understand that the better battery ALONE will lead Lucid to success. Efficiency is key. Energy, how its generated, and the efficiency at which it is produced is becoming more and more important because gasoline becomes more scarce every day.

These new EVs can, and probably already are, in the business of energy storage. These batteries could power our homes and everything else to. Which is what makes these companies great. The technology can be used outside of vehicles to power our world in a more efficient manner.

And right now, Lucid and their unmatched batteries just gained the lead in that department.

So watch. As Lucid vehicles drive down every street in America within the next 2 years. Because nothing makes a car popular other than itself. Driving down roads. For all the world to see.

Lucid's stock price of roughly $40 will haunt you compared to what it IS worth because its going nowhere but up.

Also, the damn cars look EXTREMELY NICE. Huge Porsche vibes in quality and design. But definitely its own look.

Buy Lucid Group stock while you still can for profit. Its competing with Tesla at 1200 a share when it is at 40.

Also, buy me a Lucid Air. If your rich like that and take orders from strangers on the internet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpfsen/why_lucid_group_will_be_a_huge_success_no_matter/

1,"11/08/2021, 23:10:55",5 months ago I posted about CLMT. Since then the stock has more than doubled. It's going to double again.,jdm127x," 5 months ago I made this Reddit thread ([https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/o0vzuh/clmtthe\_reusable\_energy\_stock\_ready\_for\_take\_off/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/o0vzuh/clmtthe_reusable_energy_stock_ready_for_take_off/))  about the insanely undervalued renewable energy stock CLMT. Since then  the stock has doubled with no signs of slowing down and is on a fast  track to the 20+ price share.

What  has changed since then? Well the company quarterly's continue to  surpass expectations but what looms large is the impending official  announcement of the Montana Deal. What is the Montana deal? The Montana  deal is an incoming partnership that will turn a large portion of its  Great Falls business into renewable feedstock processing. The project is  underway and the renewable manufacturing plant will be commissioned in  the first half of 2022 to process soybean oil feedstock. The end goal is  to integrate into farm and ranch operations  within Montana for other  renewable feedstocks. The biggest and most exciting opportunity to come  out of this new partnership is the goal of renewable diesel. Analysts  suggest not only will this be massive boon to CLMT share value and  company value, but many analysts suggest that this Great Falls plant  posseses the tech to be the single most advanced, efficient and  lucrative renewable energy plant in North America.

Currently  CLMT sits with an estimated 2 billion dollar company valuation. When  the Montana partnership is announced and operations commence, many  analysts suggest the valuation of CLMT could DOUBLE to 4 billion.  Currently CLMT sits at an asking price of roughly $11.90 per share,  making it one of the single best investment options on the market. Not  only will this stock find its way into the 20's, but in my estimation,  CLMT has all the makings of a company heading into the 40-50s per share  price.

CLMT represents the leading  tech in renewable energy, something  the  future can't avoid. U.S  targets   2050 bid to wean airlines off fossil fuels. This is the future  people,   there is no getting away from it. Companies like CLMT are  going to be ESSENTIAL to these kind of goals. I have been spot on in  terms of laying out this stocks trajectory. This stock isn't some stupid  ape company with no real assets that will crash leaving someone holding  expensive bags. This is a real company with real assets for those  looking to make an INVESTMENT. CLMT could generate 450-500 in EBITDA  which would be an absurd cash flow for a market cap of 800M. Many ape  stocks sell many times that market cap and dont even have revenue, never  mind cash flow. Despite the success of CLMT in the past 5 months, it  still remains at a BARGAIN price. But it wont last forever. Get in. Get  in now. Gains are coming our way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpfm98/5_months_ago_i_posted_about_clmt_since_then_the/

1,"11/08/2021, 22:44:15",Deep Biontech (BNTX) analysis and why i think a rally could start after Q3 earnings tomorrow,Muffy_SuperGosu," 

* **Forecast for this week** (see full details on financials further down)

This week BNTX will shine; Q3 ER on Tuesday and oncology congress 10-14 November (see pipeline below). Moderna missed earning last week and reduced the guidance for 2021; this reduction was not driven by lack of demand, it was driven by delays in manufacturing. BNTX-PFE jumped in and took over the demand Moderna failed to serve. The current drop is still an overreaction of the market to the Pfizer anti-viral which cause a lot of Stop/Loss drops and liquidation of call options.

Pfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be $13 Bn, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from $33 Bn to $36 Bn. Consensus estimate is $12.27 EPS Q3. We estimate a somewhat better result, $12.75 at minimum, driven by a/o higher sales volume and improved financing result. Similar to what happened to this stock for Q4 2020 earning on March 31st 2021, the most likely scenario is a rally starting directly after the Q3 earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Market manipulation**

Biontech is a fairly new stock on the Nasdaq and due to its small freefloat of approx. 240m shares, it got highly manipulated by market makers the recent year.

It seems like big money and algos are trading Biontech and Moderna as only one mRNA-Stock. Both stocks are glued together, although they should have a contrary movement. (i.g. Biontech gets its FDA approval, Moderna goes up; Pfizer reporting a surpass of the quarterly estimates, Moderna goes up). Neglecting some more money flow to Moderna, their movement is sync by seconds on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

Biontech vs Moderna

* **Market share**

Plain and simple Comirnaty is dominating the vaccine race in western world and now rapidly expanding to takeover Sputnik and the Chinese vaccines in Latam and other regions that relied on those vaccines at the start of the pandemic

&amp;#x200B;

* **Proof of concept**

Biontech was the first company in the world with a real vaccine for corona. Uur ahin was standing beside Donald Trump in front of the White House while announcing this news.

Other companies tried to follow suit, but the most of them failed (i.e. Curevac). Only Moderna could produce another working mRNA vaccine.

This proof of concept can be extrapolated to all other vaccines in their pipeline and Biontech has the highest likelihood for a good outcome.

 **Safety**

Comparing all vaccines available on the market, Comirnaty has the lowest side effects of all.

AstraZeneca had a lot of issues and is no longer used in the European Union, never got authorized in the US. Moderna has also a higher risk of heart inflammations and its use got stopped in countries like Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland for males under 30 years old. The FDA recently authorized under EUA the use of Comirnaty for children over 5 years old. In contrast, Modernas authorization for children above 12 got delayed to at least January. The Biden administration has purchased enough pediatric doses to vaccinate 100% of children between 5 and 11 years old. This gives Biontech a monopoly for children vaccination.

 **Capacity**

The demand for COVID vaccines is huge and the biggest bottleneck has been and continues to be production capacity and where vaccine manufacturers have struggled. This is where Biontech in partnership with Pfizer have done a stellar job ramping up manufacturing capacity from original 2021 estimate of 1Bn to 3Bn doses for 2021, followed by 4bn doses in 2022 and beyond. To reach this goal they have already a new production building in Marburg Germany with a capacity of 1bn doses a year.

Biontech is also expanding their production all over the world. In 2022, they will start a production building in Singapur and also in Africa with a cooperation with Ruanda and Senegal, in cooperation with the national governments and co-funded by international donors. In addition they have entered in a joint venture with the Chinese company Fosun, plans for and are building another plant with a capacity of 1 bn doses for the Chinese Asian market have been announced.

 **COVID outlook, from pandemic to endemic**

No matter which vaccine youll take, the protection efficacy is waning. The coronavirus is also mutating constantly to new variants, just like the flu. You dont need an accurate forecast to realize that the virus is here to stay. All over the world, the governments are starting the 3rd booster jab. Talks about a 4th booster are already taking place. An annual vaccination will be the rule, once again think about the flu, exact same but for a much more deadly and infectious virus. Well see a constant cashflow. While most analysts are just too afraid to announce this in public still ignore this, BoFA has been estimating an annual booster demand at the size of flu vaccination demand, 58% of population in industrialised countries. The EU has secured 450m booster doses for each of 2022 and 2023, with an option for doubling should two booster shots per year become necessary. Booster prices have been raised by some 25% or more in most industrialized countries, including EU, USA, and the UK over 2021 prices, with Pfizer seeing further room for increase when comparing with other vaccines, e.g. against Shingles or Streptococces.

 **Cancer pipeline**

Biontech has a long-lasting experience in cancer research. They are the technical pinnacle with the mRNA cancer treatment currently and way ahead of all other companies in the world. They have four cancer studies in their 2nd phase which are extremely promising. For instance, they cured cancer of 17 mice out of 20 completely. The other 3 mice shrunk their tumors dramatically. A real cure for cancer is ahead of us! There is an upcoming (11/10-11/14) oncology conference called SITC where Biontech has 7 abstract and a late-breaking presentation. The pipeline includes two PD-L1 antibody combination therapies, developed in cooperation with Genmab, which initial reports call ""very promising"". The PD-(L)1 antibody market was some 27 bn USD in 2020, with expected annual growth rates of up to 35%, and includes blockbusters such as Keytruda (Merck). Another presentation will be on BioNTech's novel CAR-T-Cell approach using mRNA, which addresses a potential 10 bn USD market by 2024.

 **Social responsibility**

Biontech and Pfizer are donating 1Bn doses at cost to the US government to be donated free of charge to the 90 poorest countries. They have pledged they will donate additional 1Bn doses to the poorest countries.

 **Pipeline**

Besides Corona and cancer, they are also working on various vaccines. Their flu vaccine developed for Pfizer has entered Phase 1 clinical trial in September. If successful, BioNTech shall be entitled to some 10% royalty on revenue, plus singificant sales-based milestone payments. Other vaccines under development include for Flu, Malaria, HIV, Tuberculosis, as well as a number yet undisclosed diseases.

 **Financials**

Pfizer and BioNTech split Comirnaty gross margins 50/50 worldwide except for China (incl. Taiwan), where BioNTech works in a similar arrangement w. Fosun.

1. **Q3** : Pfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be 13 bn USD, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from 33 bn USD to 36 bn. However, the Pfizer business quarters/ years outside the US are December to November, with a June to August Q3. As such, non US-revenues for September 21 are still missing from their Q3 figures, the same applies to Dec. 21 in their annual guidance. Based on a tally of individual contracts that have been reported publicly, Q3 Comirnaty revenue for calendar Q3 is estimated at some $14.15 bn USD (including $190 m via Fosun), and for 2021 at around $45.6 bn (including $615m via Fosun).
2. **Q4**: There are still a handful question marks, including the COVAX absorption of US donations. There are more than 100m doses that the US has announced to make available to COVAX in Q4 2021, but which COVAX has so far not allocated and/or assigned a delivery date to. Secondly, there is uncertainty whether monthly delivery of 37.5m booster/Kid vaccine doses to the EU will start in December 21 (Pfizer statement during Q2 ER), or Jan. 22 (EU announcement this summer). Q4 revenue in question is some 850m USD, depending also on the USD/EUR exchange rate.
3. **Annual 2021:** The $45.6 bn 2021 revenue forecast represents the optimistic scenario. OTOH, contracts with a number of high-income countries, most notably the Gulf States, Israel and Singapore, have hardly been published. Israel has certainly purchased further boosters and kid vaccines for delivery already in 2021, and the same may be assumed for Saudi Arabia, which has already authorized Comirnaty boosters, and shots for 5-11yos, and are preparing for kid vaccination to still start in 2021. Especially Saudi-Arabia, with a population of 34 million, and exclusively relying on Comirnaty boosters and kid vaccines, could be sizeable in this respect. All in all, there might be an upside potential of some good $500M additional revenue 2021 from yet unpublished / unrecorded booster &amp; kids vaccines contracts. Furthermore, should there be delivery delays to COVAX, it may be assumed that some of the supply will be assigned to Taiwan, possibly bringing in another $210M in revenue in December 21 from there, which is currently assumed to only occur in Q1/22.
4. **Annual 2022:** PFE has pre-announced at minimum sales of 1.7 bn doses Comirnaty, for a total revenue of $29 Bn. Note that this forecast only includes contracts signed by Oct. 15, 2021. I.e., recent contracts announced afterwards as e.g. the US purchasing an additional 50m doses of kids vaccines for 2022, S. Korea buying 30m more doses, the Uruguayan purchase of 3.7m doses, and the 3.5m doses to Costa Rica, shall come on top, as shall be major booster contracts still under negotiation such as 150m doses for Brazil, 55m doses for the Phillipines, 50m doses for Vietnam, and a undisclosed quantity for Malaysia. Moreover, the Pfizer forecast will in all likelihood again relate to the ""Pfizer Year"" outside the US, i.e. 12/21 - 11/22. Importantly, the Pfizer 2022 outlook yields an average price per dose of 17.1 USD. When deducting 800m doses to be supplied as US donation to COVAX at 7 USD/dose, the price on the remainder goes up to even 31.6 USD/dose. This is far higher than the announced booster prices for the US ($24) and the EU ($23), suggesting that most of the other booster contracts already signed, including with Japan, Australia, S. Korea and the UK, should be at prices of 30 USD/dose or above. It also serves as further strong indication of already signed sizeable, and highly priced contracts with several Gulf States, Israel and Singapore.""

If a rally starts or not, in the worst case you support a company that saved the world and is working towards curing cancer.

1,"11/08/2021, 22:35:39",Investment Trusts,BankStationPodcast,"Hello,

I did some research on investment trusts. They are an english product and most of them trade on the London Stock Exchange.

These are funds just like open ended funds like ETFs. However, they have a closed ended structure. This means that they trade on an exchange just like regular companies and they have a finite number of shares (unless they issue more shares or buy back some).

This structure means that the share price can move in a way that is uncorrelated with the value of the assets inside the fund. For example, NextEnergy Solar Fund (BBG ticker NESF LN Equity) invests in solar panels in europe. The value of the panels inside the fund will stay constant or will change according to energy prices. However, the share price change daily based on demand from investors, independently from the value of the assets inside the fund.

This means that often the shares trade at a discount to the Net Asset Value of the fund.

This closed end structure is an advantage to the investment manager of the fund as they do not need to sell assets in order to satisfy redemption of the shares of the fund. As investors cannot redeem the shares but they can only sell them on the market like regular companies. This is ideal for investment trusts that invest in real assets such as wind turbines, solar panels and infrastructure. As these assets are physical and harder to sell then stocks. Therefore this structure is ideal for the manager of the fund.

The trading opportunity here is twofold:

1. Investment trust that trade a disocunt could be a great way to obtain exposure to a sector such as infrastructure and renewables at a discount to the NAV
2. It could be a trade opportunity going long trusts that are at a discount and shorting them when they start trading at a premium to NAV. You could also buy an investment trust at a discount and wait for the discount to narrow

Warning! Several trusts trade at a discount and stay at a discount. The discount do not narrow all the time. It could also widen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpex6j/investment_trusts/

1,"11/08/2021, 22:32:01",Deep Biontech (BNTX) analysis and why i think a rally could start after Q3 earnings tomorrow,Muffy_SuperGosu,"*  **Forecast for this week**  (see full details on financials further down)

This week BNTX will shine; Q3 ER on Tuesday and oncology congress 10-14 November (see pipeline below). Moderna missed earning last week and reduced the guidance for 2021; this reduction was not driven by lack of demand, it was driven by delays in manufacturing. BNTX-PFE jumped in and took over the demand Moderna failed to serve. The current drop is still an overreaction of the market to the Pfizer anti-viral which cause a lot of Stop/Loss drops and liquidation of call options.

Pfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be $13 Bn, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from $33 Bn to $36 Bn. Consensus estimate is $12.27 EPS Q3. We estimate a somewhat better result, $12.75 at minimum, driven by a/o higher sales volume and improved financing result. Similar to what happened to this stock for Q4 2020 earning on March 31st 2021, the most likely scenario is a rally starting directly  after the Q3 earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Market manipulation**

Biontech is a fairly new stock on the Nasdaq and due to its small freefloat of approx. 240m shares, it got highly manipulated by market makers the recent year.

It seems like big money and algos are trading Biontech and Moderna as only one mRNA-Stock. Both stocks are glued together, although they should have a contrary movement. (i.g. Biontech gets its FDA approval, Moderna goes up; Pfizer reporting a surpass of the quarterly estimates, Moderna goes up). Neglecting some more money flow to Moderna, their movement is sync by seconds on a daily basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Biontech vs Moderna](https://preview.redd.it/pc16ky9updy71.jpg?width=1532&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72cf556ad0b81c4b8c4033cc6966307f6e043a27)

*  **Market share** 

Plain and simple Comirnaty is dominating the vaccine race in western world and now rapidly expanding to takeover Sputnik and the Chinese vaccines in Latam and other regions that relied on those vaccines at the start of the pandemic 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eapifrn3qdy71.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=379a89aaaac9b84ff4391de6b157602b327aed61

*  **Proof of concept** 

Biontech was the first company in the world with a real vaccine for corona. Uur ahin was standing beside Donald Trump in front of the White House while announcing this news.

Other companies tried to follow suit, but the most of them failed (i.e. Curevac). Only Moderna could produce another working mRNA vaccine.

This proof of concept can be extrapolated to all other vaccines in their pipeline and Biontech has the highest likelihood for a good outcome.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Safety**

Comparing all vaccines available on the market, Comirnaty has the lowest side effects of all.

AstraZeneca had a lot of issues and is no longer used in the European Union, never got authorized in the US. Moderna has also a higher risk of heart inflammations and its use got stopped in countries like Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland for males under 30 years old. The FDA recently  authorized under EUA the use of Comirnaty for children over 5 years old. In contrast, Modernas authorization for children above 12 got delayed to at least January. The Biden administration has purchased enough pediatric doses to vaccinate 100% of children between 5 and 11 years old. This gives Biontech a monopoly for children vaccination.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Capacity**

 The demand for COVID vaccines is huge and the biggest bottleneck has been and continues to be production capacity and where vaccine manufacturers have struggled. This is where Biontech in partnership with Pfizer have done a stellar job ramping up manufacturing capacity from original 2021 estimate of 1Bn to 3Bn doses for 2021, followed by 4bn doses in 2022 and beyond. To reach this goal they have already a new production building in Marburg Germany with a capacity of 1bn doses a year. 

Biontech is also expanding their production all over the world. In 2022, they will start a production building in Singapur and also in Africa with a cooperation with Ruanda and Senegal, in cooperation with the national governments and co-funded by international donors.  In addition they have entered in a joint venture with the Chinese company Fosun, plans for and are building another plant with a capacity of 1 bn doses for the Chinese Asian market have been announced.

&amp;#x200B;

 **COVID outlook, from pandemic to endemic**

No matter which vaccine youll take, the protection efficacy is waning. The coronavirus is also mutating constantly to new variants, just like the flu. You dont need an accurate forecast to realize that the virus is here to stay. All over the world, the governments are starting the 3rd booster jab. Talks about a 4th booster are already taking place. An annual vaccination will be the rule, once again think about the flu, exact same but for a much more deadly and infectious virus. Well see a constant cashflow. While most analysts are just too afraid to announce this in public still ignore this, BoFA has been estimating an annual booster demand at the size of flu vaccination demand, 58% of population in industrialised countries. The EU has secured 450m booster doses for each of 2022 and 2023, with an option for doubling should two booster shots per year become necessary. Booster prices have been raised by some 25% or more in most industrialized countries, including EU, USA, and the UK over 2021 prices, with Pfizer seeing further room for increase when comparing with other vaccines, e.g. against Shingles or Streptococces.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Cancer pipeline**

Biontech has a long-lasting experience in cancer research. They are the technical pinnacle with the mRNA cancer treatment currently and way ahead of all other companies in the world. They have four cancer studies in their 2nd phase which are extremely promising. For instance, they cured cancer of 17 mice out of 20 completely. The other 3 mice shrunk their tumors dramatically. A real cure for cancer is ahead of us! There is an upcoming (11/10-11/14) oncology conference called SITC where Biontech has 7 abstract and a late-breaking presentation. The pipeline includes two PD-L1 antibody combination therapies, developed in cooperation with Genmab, which initial reports call ""very promising"". The PD-(L)1 antibody market was some 27 bn USD in 2020, with expected annual growth rates of up to 35%, and includes blockbusters such as Keytruda (Merck). Another presentation will be on BioNTech's novel CAR-T-Cell approach using mRNA, which addresses a potential 10 bn USD market by 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Social responsibility**

Biontech and Pfizer are donating 1Bn doses at cost to the US government to be donated free of charge to the 90 poorest countries. They have pledged they will donate additional 1Bn doses to the poorest countries.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Pipeline**

Besides Corona and cancer, they are also working on various vaccines. Their flu vaccine developed for Pfizer has entered Phase 1 clinical trial in September. If successful, BioNTech shall be entitled to some 10% royalty on revenue, plus singificant sales-based milestone payments. Other vaccines under development include for Flu, Malaria, HIV, Tuberculosis, as well as a number yet undisclosed diseases.

&amp;#x200B;

   **Financials**

Pfizer and BioNTech split Comirnaty gross margins 50/50 worldwide except for China (incl. Taiwan), where BioNTech works in a similar arrangement w. Fosun. 

1.  **Q3** :  Pfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be 13 bn USD, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from 33 bn USD to 36 bn. However, the Pfizer business quarters/ years outside the US are December to November, with a June to August Q3. As such, non US-revenues for September 21 are still missing from their Q3 figures, the same applies to Dec. 21 in their annual guidance. Based on a tally of individual contracts that have been reported publicly, Q3 Comirnaty revenue for calendar Q3 is estimated at some $14.15 bn USD (including $190 m via Fosun), and for 2021 at around $45.6 bn (including $615m via Fosun).  
2.  **Q4**: There are still a handful question marks, including the COVAX absorption of US donations. There are more than 100m doses that the US has announced to make available to COVAX in Q4 2021, but which COVAX has so far not allocated and/or assigned a delivery date to. Secondly, there is uncertainty whether monthly delivery of 37.5m booster/Kid  vaccine doses to the EU will start in December 21 (Pfizer statement during Q2 ER), or Jan. 22 (EU announcement this summer). Q4 revenue in question is some 850m USD, depending also on the USD/EUR exchange rate. 
3.  **Annual 2021:**   The $45.6 bn 2021 revenue forecast represents the optimistic scenario. OTOH, contracts with a number of high-income countries, most notably the Gulf States, Israel and Singapore, have hardly been published. Israel has certainly purchased further boosters and kid vaccines for delivery already in 2021, and the same may be assumed for Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which have both already authorized Comirnaty boosters, and shots for 5-11yos, and are preparing for kid vaccination to still start in 2021. Especially Saudi-Arabia, with a population of 34 million, and exclusively relying on Comirnaty boosters and kid vaccines, could be sizeable in this respect. All in all, there might be an upside potential of some good $500M additional revenue 2021 from yet unpublished / unrecorded booster &amp; kids vaccines contracts. Furthermore, should there be delivery delays to COVAX, it may be assumed that some of the supply will be assigned to Taiwan, possibly bringing in another $210M in revenue in December 21 from there, which is currently assumed to only occur in Q1/22. 
4.  **Annual 2022:**  PFE has pre-announced at minimum sales of 1.7 bn doses Comirnaty, for a total revenue of $29 Bn. Note that this forecast only includes contracts signed by Oct. 15, 2021. I.e., recent contracts announced afterwards as e.g. the US purchasing an additional 50m doses of kids vaccines for 2022, S. Korea buying 30m more doses, the Uruguayan purchase of 3.7m doses, and the 3.5m doses to Costa Rica, shall come on top, as shall be major booster contracts still under negotiation such as 150m doses for Brazil, 55m doses for the Phillipines, 50m doses for Vietnam, and a undisclosed quantity for Malaysia. Moreover, the Pfizer forecast will in all likelihood again relate to the ""Pfizer Year"" outside the US, i.e. 12/21 - 11/22.    Importantly, the Pfizer 2022 outlook yields an average price per dose of 17.1 USD. When deducting 800m doses to be supplied as US donation to COVAX at 7 USD/dose, the price on the remainder goes up to even 31.6 USD/dose. This is far higher than the announced booster prices for the US ($24) and the EU ($23), suggesting that most of the other booster contracts already signed, including with Japan, Australia, S. Korea and the UK, should be at prices of 30 USD/dose or above. It also serves as further strong indication of already signed sizeable, and highly priced contracts with several Gulf States, Israel and Singapore.""

&amp;#x200B;

If a rally starts or not, in the worst case you support a company that saved the world and is working towards curing cancer.

Recently one of the reps of SDC mentioned that they are unboarding lot of new Dentist into their network, more than we have staff to handle

With the expansion abroad which majority of Revenue exist (75%), I think the future of SDC, 1-2 years out will be great. 
Dont sell out in my opinion if there is a small hickup in Q3 earning. Looking at google trends for European countries and looking at booking schedules for Germany and UK, its all booked out! It started to get more busy for Germany in early september (End of Q3), so Q4 will likely reflect that!


Now to the math!

Approximately 1.6mil patients have finnished SDC Aligner therapy, they all will need retainers to maintain their smile. Obviously there is some patients who dont buy retainers or buy them once. But its recommended to change retainers 2X/ Year =$200
1.6mil patients X$200= $320mil reoccurring Revenue per year! And this keep increasing as they sell more Aligners!


Approximately 100k patients start Aligner therapy per quarter 
Of those 50% pay in full and the rest pay $250 deposit and $89/month for 24months.

50k pay in full = 50k X$1950=$97.5mil Revenue
50k smilepay= 50k X $250deposit =$12.5mil Revenue
50k x $89 x3months (quarter)= $13.35 Revenue


Keep in mind that other patients that signed up for Smile pay from previous quarters are paying into the system for 24months.
50k patients per quarter!
8 quarters in 2 years!
50k X 8 Quarters = 400,000 patients pay $89 Monthly! 
$400,000 x $89 X 3 months= $106,8mil Revenue!


Revenue from Oral care products, if you follow social media, you can see that SDC whitening light is a big hit, people love it and the CFO said that 10% of revenue was from oral care products and keep increasing. So Approximately $20mil USD revenue per quarter.

SDC is in growth stage, (you spend money to make money) and spend money on marketing (50%). I think they will start cutting that down by q3 2022. If that happens SDC can be profitable the following day! Then the stock price should be $40-50 if it would follow ALGN multiples


Looking at all of this, you understand why I am bullish on SDC. Little FUD from few shorts that dont understand their business is not going to sway me into selling. If this earnings is not good, wait and listen to the earning report and see what management says about future outlook, that matters! 
Good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qped0p/smile_direct_club_sdc_my_view/

___

Analysis:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk faces a tax bill of more than $15 billion in the coming months on stock options, making a sale of his Tesla stock this year likely regardless of the Twitter vote.

Musk asked his 62.7 million Twitter followers over the weekend whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla holdings. Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock, he tweeted.

The Tesla CEO said he would abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes. The results were 58% in favor of selling and 42% against, suggesting he will sell the shares.

The electric vehicle giant beat third-quarter estimates despite chip shortages and supply-chain bottleneck. It reported adjusted earnings of $1.86 a share, up 145% over the same quarter last year and above estimates of $1.62. Sales came in at $13.76 billion, 57% above the year-ago period and matching expectations, according to FactSet.

Tesla delivered 241,300 vehicles in the quarter, racing past estimates of 232,000. Shipments grew 20% from the prior quarter and 73% from the year-ago period. In addition, Tesla vehicle deliveries in China surged 44% from the previous quarter to 133,218. Its third-quarter results were reported late Oct. 20.

""We believe electric vehicle demand is outstripping supply for Tesla by roughly 30,000 units and the chip shortage has clearly amplified this dynamic,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients.

However, he said, ""Big supply help is on its way for Tesla as the long awaited factory hubs in Austin and Berlin are set to have the red ribbon cut over the coming months and should expand Tesla's capacity to roughly 2 million units annually over the next 18 months.""

Ives has an outperform rating on Tesla stock and raised his price target to 1,100, from 1,000. Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh raised his price target to 950, from 825, with a buy rating.

Will Massive Expansion Bolster TSLA Stock
Tesla has undertaken a massive expansion of its manufacturing capabilities. Musk wants to eventually build 20 million electric vehicles a year over the next decade. That's more than double the current production of other auto-making giants. So it's now on a mission to rapidly expand its manufacturing capabilities.

Meanwhile, Tesla Autopilot probes expanded.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a letter to Tesla, demand a wealth of data as part of its probe of 12 Tesla Autopilot crashes into first responder vehicles parked on the side of roads.  Safety regulators also will probe a Tesla crash in New York killing a person changing a tire

When Tesla starts pumping out cars in Germany, it will go head-to-head in electric vehicles with three established German names: Volkswagen Group (VWAGY), BMW (BMWYY) and the Mercedes-Benz division of Daimler AG (DDAIF). Other serious competitors include General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F), in addition to its China rivals. These include Nio (NIO) Xpeng (XPEV) and Li Auto (LI).

Checkup On Tesla Stock
According to the IBD Stock Checkup tool, Tesla stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 99 out of 99. When choosing growth stocks for the biggest potential gains based on the CAN SLIM investment paradigm, focus on those with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher. Shooting for a 95 or higher, particularly at the start of a new bull market, is even better.

The stock also has a Relative Strength Rating of 97 out of 99. The rating means that Tesla stock has outperformed 97% of all stocks in the IBD database over the past 12 months.

Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is A+. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A grade of A signals heavy institutional buying. The lowest rating of E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

Among other Tesla data points, its relative strength line has been moving upward and holding. That's a positive signal. The RS line measures a stock's strength against all stocks in the S&amp;P 500. The RS line is the blue line in the chart shown. Typically, the RS line of the strongest stocks is either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground.

In the stock market, timing is critical. So when you're looking for stocks to buy or sell, it's important to do the fundamental and technical analysis that identifies lower-risk entry points that also offer solid potential rewards.

Is Tesla Stock A Buy?
Tesla stock is not a buy as it is now extended from a 900.50 buy point from a cup-base handle, according to MarketSmith. It triggered the eight-week hold rule after rapidly reaching its profit goal from its latest entry.

Tesla stock hit a record high on Nov. 1, after announcing plans to open its supercharging network to other EVs in Europe for the first time. The pilot project takes place at 10 supercharger locations in the Netherlands. The next day, however, Tesla stock pulled back after Musk tweeted that no contract with Hertz has been signed yet.

Last week, the EV giant's shares moved above a $1 trillion valuation milestone on news that Tesla had partnered with Hertz, one of the largest car rental companies in the world, to provide it with 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2022.

Musk was awarded options in 2012 as part of a compensation plan. Because he doesnt take a salary or cash bonus, his wealth comes from stock awards and the gains in Teslas share price. The 2012 award was for 22.8 million shares at a strike price of $6.24 per share. Tesla shares closed at $1,222.09 on Friday, meaning his gain on the shares totals just under $28 billion.

The company has also recently disclosed that Musk has taken out loans using his shares as collateral, and with the sales, Musk may want to repay some of those loan obligations.

As Tesla noted in its third-quarter Securities and Exchange Commission 10-Q filing this year: If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.

The options expire in August of next year. Yet in order to exercise them, Musk has to pay the income tax on the gain. Since the options are taxed as an employee benefit or compensation, they will be taxed at top ordinary-income levels, or 37% plus the 3.8% net investment tax. He will also have to pay the 13.3% top tax rate in California since the options were granted and mostly earned while he was a California tax resident.

Combined, the state and federal tax rate will be 54.1%. So the total tax bill on his options, at the current price, would be $15 billion.

Musk hasnt confirmed the size of the tax bill. But he tweeted: Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.

At an appearance at the Code conference in September, Musk said: I have a bunch of options that are expiring early next year, so ... a huge block of options will sell in Q4  because I have to or theyll expire.

Musk, of course, could also borrow more against his Tesla shares, which now total over $200 billion. Yet he has already pledged 92 million shares to lenders for cash borrowing. When asked at the Code conference about borrowing against such volatile shares, he said, Stocks dont always go up, they also go down.

Since CEOs have limited windows in which to sell stock, and Musk would likely want to stagger the sales over at least two quarters, analysts and tax experts have been expecting Musk to start selling in the fourth quarter of 2021.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpe6ar/short_tesla_with_a_25x_leverage_expiring_tomorrow/
1,"11/08/2021, 21:55:53",he big bad market  huff and puff and blow your top off 11/8/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY.,jmj_daytrader," First Let me explain what I mean by the start of a pullback or correction. For a while I have been pointing to Nov. 5th as the start of a possible pullback or correction. Nov. 5th ended up being what's called a blow off top. Facts on what a blow off top is quoted form Investopedia in article by Cory Mitchell: A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a steep and rapid increase in a securitys price and trading volume, followed by a steep and rapid drop in priceusually on significant or high volume as well. Blow-off tops occur in all markets and can impact stocks, futures, commodities, bonds, and currencies. A blow-off top indicates that a securitys price is about to fall. This does not mean the price will fall immediately though. The rising part of a blow-off can last weeks. The early part of this rise may look exceptional, with big daily and weekly price gains. Yet, sometimes, it still may continue to escalate for several more weeks. also quoted from same article.    Now that I have definitions out of the way, let me repeat tops are a process. I dont expect to just topple over into a number of down days yet, However, this begins the fight between bulls and bears for momentum. In my eyes we get the gift of two-sided trade. I expect to see strong days in both directions at times. These next couple weeks will be difficult to handicap. Remember the market just went thru the last couple weeks proving that risk forecasting is growing extremely inefficient.     as for today's trade scenario's,

1) Range Day with bullish bias to it. 1st Support should be around the 467 area and 1st resistance should be around 470area. We should work our way up and begin to fade around the 470area, dont be surprise if we over shot in either direction, highs to 471 area and low side toward 465 area. 40% probability

2) we get a trend day up. If we open gap up above 468.52 by a decent distance, look for a halfhearted try to close the gap stopping short of 468.52 then taking off to the up side with a target of 470 area. Again, dont be surprised by and over shot to 471 area. 25% probability  

 

3) A rounded reversal day. Which requires us to come in to the open gapped up a considerable amount above Fridays close of 468.52 and not look back taking off toward the target of 470-471 before reaching a midday chop. The main signal for this type of day is watching your internals or indicator having a continuous slight trend down for the day while price diverges up. After midday chop watch for a drop the second half of the day. 35% Probability",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpe4rj/he_big_bad_market_huff_and_puff_and_blow_your_top/

*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 100 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked up 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures traded near the flatline.
*****
&gt; The moves in futures trading came after the U.S. House of Representatives late Friday passed a more than $1 trillion infrastructure bill, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden for his signature. The package passed by the Senate in August would provide new funding for transportation, utilities and broadband, among other infrastructure projects.
*****
&gt; Dow 30 mainstay Caterpillar saw its shares rise about 5% premarket as the manufacturer of construction equipment could benefit from the spending package. Heavy equipment producer Deere also got a lift, with shares up more than 2%. Vulcan Materials gained nearly 7% and Nucor added more than 4%.
*****
&gt; A number of energy companies also got a boost on rising energy prices and after President Joe Bidens remark that he does not expect OPEC+ nations to react to a call to speed production. Coterra Energy added about 1% premarket.
*****
&gt; Tesla founder Elon Musk rattled investors this weekend, asking in a Twitter poll whether he should sell 10% of his stock as a response to political clamoring to tax unrealized gains from equity holdings. As some 58% of respondents said yes, shares in Tesla dropped more than 4% in premarket trading.
*****

*****
&gt; The economy is certainly picking up some momentum, JPMorgans David Lebovitz said Friday on CNBCs Squawk on the Street. We are expecting economic growth to accelerate here into the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve earlier last week announced a plan to begin tapering its pandemic-era economic aid by the end of November, putting the central bank on track to end its asset purchase program by the middle of next year.
*****

November 8, 2021, Vinco Ventures, Inc. (NASDAQ) today announced the filing of a Form 10 registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with the planned spin-off of its subsidiary Cryptyde, Inc. The spin-off would make Cryptyde a stand-alone, publicly traded Nasdaq listed company. VincoVentures will continue to trade under the ticker symbol on Nasdaq following completion of the planned spin-off and currently planned subsequent merger with Zash Global Media and Entertainment Corp. The Cryptyde executive team has been transitioned from Vinco, with former Vinco Chief Strategy Officer, Brian McFadden, named Chief Executive Officer of Cryptyde, Vinco Chief Financial Officer, Brent Vroman, named Chief Financial Officer of Cryptyde, with him serving in both capacities as his duties are transitioned to the new Vinco CFO previously named, and the majority of the board of directors of Cryptyde consisting of former Vinco board members.
The Form 10 includes detailed information about Cryptyde, including historical financial information, as well as business strategy, risk factors and legal and financial disclosures:
* Distribution ratio in the spin-off is 1 share of Cryptyde common stock for every 10 shares of Vinco common stock.

Against Friday's close that's a $28 billion gain on soon to expire stock options.  All up the tax owed would be $15 billion.  The guy also owes loans taken out against borrowed stock.

Musk and other executives have many other generous in the money stock option awards, that will require both collateral to exercise and tax to be paid which can only realistically come from share sales.

The shares would have had to be sold at some point, irrespective of his Twitter poll outcome.  More theatrics from Musk.

I would like some advise.

I currently have stocks and shares ISAs, and a SIPP. I am heavily invested in US tech as I believe that is where my money will grow the most. These accounts are with HL. I do have a smaller account with T212 which I leave for some penny stocks that I think will do well over time.

However in the last couple of months, I have seen a few videos on options trading and would like to add this to my skillset as it seems to be a better way to enhance your profits.

I dont know how or what platform I can use to put place call options in the US markets, can someone advise what is the best way? Ideally I would like to do it in a tax-free/efficient way but if there isnt a way of doing that then so be it, Ill just pay CGT on any gains.

1,"11/08/2021, 15:38:46",$HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special!,Yield_Fanatic,"**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

&amp;#x200B;

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a *******GME Xmas special*****.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up.. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).

&amp;#x200B;

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays***  with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q321 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

&amp;#x200B;

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX***  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8qea2duvrby71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa533ebd26875345eaf4c62fc263b263fd7e147

&amp;#x200B;

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) ..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)***  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, thats the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the ***GME Xmas special***.

So, why do I mention a ***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*\*\*  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a ***GME Xmas special***.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c0i4pnqwrby71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93f3de4dd8eb9c3788bd14993f62d51d2214651

&amp;#x200B;

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r689rsjxrby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba222cfe0972ca651243195605b554e26f4d8ba

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis  I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS  as a dividend (paid in Jul21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment***\*\*\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D***  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ycrah2gzrby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22fbdf056d2a59dae4f167ab2af4342d1155f6ea

&amp;#x200B;

Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3 Earnings**

Now  lets discuss the recent earnings

***Q321 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q321 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q321 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q321 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressureor at least thats what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q420) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to  its customers anyway.

Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 50%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 47.6% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopezs question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bet6o463sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ae1b659f263b95c39d8baa62943b9e8d944ce87

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance ***again and again and again*** (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say ***management is highly credible.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC***  to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall)  ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.

Also, and more importantly ***successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fafsthl5sby71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1b593a646120e9a85282d0a7bf396dc938b5b23

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medicalto name a few. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

&amp;#x200B;

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA***  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary***  although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Lets squeeze this one dry. GME Xmas special.**

Here are strategies to create a potassium-rich world:

**Supporting the Economy:**  
Buy bananas whenever possible. You can buy them in bunches or by the single banana. Buy bananas as gifts for family and friends. Save your banana peels and give them to the government. They will turn the peels into new money for you! 

**Paying taxes with Bananas:**   
Pay your taxes with bananas instead of money. If your city doesn't accept bananas, demand that they do so or move to a different city. 

**Educating the youth:**   
Teach your children the value of saving their money on bananas instead of worthless paper. (or pay them in bananas) 

**Protest:**   
Gather a group of like-minded individuals and hold a protest, or march demanding that your government recognize bananas as the leading legal tender. 

**Banana Banking:**   
Open up a bank account at your local bank. Decorate the name on the account to something amusing such as ""Big Banana"", ""Mr. Banana"" or ""Great Banana"". 

**Parties**:   
Have a bunch of friends over for a banana themed party. Buy a bunch of bananas and have fun! Have another bunch of friends over for another banana themed party. Sell the excess bananas you have leftover from the first party to your guests at a price lower than supermarket prices. 

Still having fun? Good, because it's not going to end any time soon. Overall, I think everyone will agree that bananas are the future of our financial system.

Hello Redditors!

I have been a big fan of Kpop for a long time and have seen many changes in the industry over the past few years. I am so glad to have been able to witness many evolutions in the Kpop industry as it became a global sensation from its unique music genres, performance styles, and fan support.

So, I thought to myself what could be the next evolution in Kpop that could happen in the next 5-10years? This is where I stumbled across the concept of **virtual artists that exist on the blockchain**.

The concept of virtual artists has been proven to come with the word success story in the same sentence. In Japan, Hatsune Miku has become a cyber celebrity that has sold out hundreds of 3D concerts in venues all around the globe. She has accelerated the modernization of the Japanese music industry with her futuristic voice being featured in over 100,000 songs. Even in Korea Aespa debuted with a separate universe of virtual avatars to accompany the real-life idols. 

I think that virtual artists could be a great concept because all of their actions can be tightly controlled to avoid any controversies that can cause serious damage to our beloved idols.

Theres a project called **Seol Stars** backed by **HUMAP**, which aims to release music under the name of YUNA who is built entirely off the blockchain. **SONGBLY84** a virtual arts creator and music creator **Tommy Lee** who worked with **IU**, **EXO**, and **Mamamoo** and more are part of this project as well!. She will be available as an NFT (Non Fungible Token) of which owners can receive benefits such as a portion of the revenue from the album sales, exclusive access to music, and a portion of advertising and streaming profits. 

The initial release is going to be **10,000 limited edition NFTs**. All are unique with different hair colours, costumes, and facial expressions. 

It feels like were going to enter another metaverse and might be seeing a new evolution in the Kpop and NFT industry soon!

1,"11/08/2021, 11:48:03",Why I'm YOLOing on $RBLX.,equinoxshadows,"Position: none (yet)

TL;DR: My 10-year-old daughter showed me Roblox and I'm all in. 

**What is Roblox?**

A few weeks ago, my 10-year-old daughter was begging my wife and me to let her download Roblox. ""EVERYONE has it!"" she bemoaned. After some initial hesitation, we let her get it with a few limitations, but neither my wife nor I really knew much about it. Since then, she's been constantly on it with her friends. They chat on Facetime as they play together until bedtime. My daughter's friend has spent over $300 in the last few months on Robux. (Which is crazy to me.)

30 minutes ago I had my daughter sit down and show me the app. From what I can tell (and what I've read,) Roblox is like Minecraft met the app store. Developers can make all sorts of games (from a haunted pizzeria obstacle course to a cutsie animal adoption game). Users have hundreds (or maybe thousands?) of games to choose from, all rendered in a Minecraft-esque blocky style. There are Roblux, (the in-game money you pay for) and in-game currencies for many individual games. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I Like the Game**

First, I have to admit the whole thing seems very kid-centric (more on this later). I'm as a middle-aged non-gamer dad, I don't think I'll be downloading the app anytime soon. BUT the whole thing is a platform, not a game. It's like an ecosystem or platform for games. (All you gaming apes are undoubtedly mocking me right now.) 

I see the business model here and I like it. By creating their own ecosystem and controlling the monetization, they and developers are both set up to win ,and history has proven app-store style businesses can be incredibly lucrative. Finally, it seems like every 10-year-old kid is talking about this game right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about the Metaverse?**

The viral term ""metaverse"" is all over the news cycle right now. Whether the metaverse in the next new digital revolution is beyond the scope of this post. But another ape a few days ago compared Meta with Roblox and made a good point in favor of Meta: they have more money to invest in this technology. While that is certainly true, Roblox has a product to market, and Meta does not. 

When you look at the beating that Meta received in the press over the last several months, whether it be the spread of misinformation or leaked documents to the Wall Street Journal, there is no doubt the company desperately wanted to change the narrative. What better way than changing their name (and thus remove all the negative associations) and promising us the future? So, they changed their name and make aspirational promises for the future. But it's all aspirational. Nothing is built. 

Roblox, on the other hand, has a product built. While I concede that it is currently kid-centric, I would imagine the infrastructure and talent is there to pivot or expand to attract more adults. If nothing else, I imagine they will soon be a target for acquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer:**

I'm too smooth-brained to know any details on earnings, revenue, and charts. That's why I'm here with my people. Maybe someone can enlighten me.

This was when (synonym for huge+ number before 6)  was trading at $35. Think about it, that makes no sense. TDA is just a brokerage, so someone is incentivizing TDA to call their whale clients holding (synonym for huge+ number before 6) on the phone to offer 17% above market price. Almost everyone getting that call would say yes, unless you're made of balls of steel like my bud who let me know about it. So why would someone want to offer $41 for a massive amount of shares when the market price is $35? Follow the motive and you'll have your answer ... 

If I was a hedge fun heavily short in (synonym for huge+ number before 6) and being the good steward of my company's assets I'd peruse reddit to get the latest on what retail is thinking. I'd discover that (synonym for huge+ number before 6) has the potential to become the next meme stock, which would be very bad for my short positions. How do I derail a company from becoming the next meme stock? Tarnish it's reputation by making it look like another PnD. How? I borrow as many shares as possible by offering 17% above market price. Once I've accumulated as many shares as possible with a cost basis around $41, I market sell them near my cost basis, which is what we saw when (synonym for huge+ number before 6) got above $42. Even better yet, I time my market sell to when some notable Pump and Dumpers tweet about it (cough cough Atlas cough cough) and the entire thing looks like a perfectly engineered PnD.

As per [u/Fuzzy\_Chipmunk\_6615](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuzzy_Chipmunk_6615/) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnj2bo/gwh_incredible_short_opportunity_guaranteed_to/) which basically outlines that an [S-1](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-317289/) has been filed for GWH which allows PIPE investors (corporations, Hedges) to sell stock bought at a discounted price. These investors often sell off shares quickly to realize gains.  This dilutes shares and drives price down, all dramatically happening in one day; creating a great short/put opportunity.

I have been reading the S-1 the last couple days and come across some interesting information mainly pgs 1, and pgs 43-53. Due to my inexperience and the complicated terms and financial reports,  I've been unable to fully understand what these sections are saying. For example some of the more interesting lines are.

&gt; The price of our Common Stock and warrants may be volatile. The price of our Common Stock and warrants may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including: 

*  sales of shares of our Common Stock by the PIPE Investors; 
*  The volume of shares of our Common Stock available for public sale, including as a result of the termination of the post-closing lock-up pursuant to the terms thereof 

EX: 2

&gt; Outstanding Public Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,333,333 shares of our Common Stock will become exercisable on November7, 2021 in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement governing those securities, and outstanding Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,500,000 shares of our Common Stock became exercisable at Closing in accordance with the Sponsor Letter Agreement

And most importantly EX: 3

&gt;  effective as of October8, 2021 (the Closing Date). Pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws, the Lock-Up Shares will be locked-up for a period of 180 days after October8, 2021, subject to certain exceptions, provided that, if following the 150th day after the Closing Date, the volume weighted average price of our Common Stock for any 20 trading days within any consecutive 30 trading day period is at least $12.00 per share, then the transfer restrictions set forth in the amended and restated bylaws shall no longer apply 

Does this mean the lock-up won't expire for at least 150 days? meaning that [u/Fuzzy\_Chipmunk\_6615](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuzzy_Chipmunk_6615/) s' 10p 11/19/21 puts won't print, or will only print because the warrants are now exercisable and not  the actual PIPE? Or am I wrong the the PIPE's unlocking within the week?

Last question if these PIPE deals all make the stock go down rapidly why isn't everyone buying puts on these things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qp46mp/questions_about_gwh_pipe_opening/

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic and YieldFanatic.com as Im too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatics DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;


(Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatics Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021  as I write this, $HIMXs current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isnt part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatics opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yields read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays  with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q321 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC)  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, thats the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the GME Xmas special.
So, why do I mention a SHORT SQUEEZE  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis  I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now  lets discuss the recent earnings
Q321 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q321 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q321 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q321 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep21 and YTD Sep21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least thats what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q420) of $0.195  i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopezs question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance again and
 again and again (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC  to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall)  GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.
Also, and more importantly successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...to name a few. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary  although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Lets squeeze this one dry. GME Xmas special.

(Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatics Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021  as I write this, $HIMXs current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isnt part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatics opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yields read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays  with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q321 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC)  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, thats the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the GME Xmas special.
So, why do I mention a SHORT SQUEEZE  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis  I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now  lets discuss the recent earnings
Q321 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q321 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q321 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q321 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep21 and YTD Sep21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least thats what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q420) of $0.195  i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopezs question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance again and
 again and again (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC  to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall)  GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.
Also, and more importantly successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...to name a few. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary  although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Lets squeeze this one dry. GME Xmas special.

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic and YieldFanatic.com as Im too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatics DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;


(Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatics Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021  as I write this, $HIMXs current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isnt part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatics opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yields read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays  with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q321 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC)  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, thats the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the GME Xmas special.
So, why do I mention a SHORT SQUEEZE  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis  I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now  lets discuss the recent earnings
Q321 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q321 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q321 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q321 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep21 and YTD Sep21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least thats what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q420) of $0.195  i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopezs question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance again and
 again and again (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC  to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall)  GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.
Also, and more importantly successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...to name a few. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary  although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Lets squeeze this one dry. GME Xmas special.

Himax Trade Idea - Script (Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatics Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021  as I write this, $HIMXs current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isnt part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatics opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yields read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays  with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q321 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC)  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, thats the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the GME Xmas special.
So, why do I mention a SHORT SQUEEZE  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis  I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now  lets discuss the recent earnings
Q321 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q321 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q321 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q321 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep21 and YTD Sep21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least thats what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q420) of $0.195  i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopezs question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance again and
 again and again (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC  to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall)  GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.
Also, and more importantly successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...to name a few. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary  although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

Majority of you use VPN to dial-into your company's internet to use on-prem or cloud apps. Basically VPN is a slow hardware your company uses(either on-prem or pay some external company to host). The hardware and VPN needs licensing. If at home you pay for 200 Mbits/second internet, **with VPN you will get 60 Mbits/sec....slow and expensive**. Your company also needs to buy or replace the hardware every few years because it becomes obsolete, or if more users need access. **old VPN is expensive and hardware based....it's what ZScaler and CITRIX provide.**

**Enter Blackberry Gateway:**  
this has Blackberry's proprietary technology and Ai based security. It's all cloud based (SAAS) so your company can scale up or down based on number of employees within minutes!! No slow hardware or licensing. **AND it's 3x faster than regular VPN** and cheaper because you don't' need hardware or licensing.

This is interesting because the Blackberry Infrastructure is highly secure. So, as a enterprise or company or government, **why would you pay for hardware slow based VPN when you can get SAAS based Blackberry gateway that's extremely secure and 3x faster and cheaper**!!! This BB Gateway will take out hardware VPN providers (VPN CITRIX and ZSCALER) and many more that are in VPN zero touch network access market. Blackberry has integrated BB Persona which is Ai based identity management feature...it create a digital you and can recognize if it's someone else based on how they type,click/hold-phone/move-mouse/error/etc. Welcome to next gen passwordless access!!

Blackberry products are all now Ai based. The Ai engine used is in 7th gen and is the MOST mature engine in the WORLD!!! No other Ai cybersecurity company's engine comes close to BB Ai Engine. The Ai engine is baked into all their products and platform.

**I highly believe this company will be the Tesla, Amazon, AMD, NVDIA, Apple, FB of Cybersecurity and IoT.**

This is my analysis and research. Please do DD before investing in any company.

# $HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special!

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a *******GME Xmas special*****.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up.. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n5x51h81m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd9a80bb277f6c024707280df2ac0800213e008

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller***  which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9wfeaf3m9y71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=075f8b8ecc9a7141c63f9854c4ef547874978c67

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q321 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vqrbjnf4m9y71.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b08916e3dec038ada1c84ce6632df424645f76e

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX***  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/068apgs4m9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cdaa1ee73ce6b8c1bc1c3a041b71d5441c3155

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) ..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)***  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, thats the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the ***GME Xmas special***.

So, why do I mention a ***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*\*\*  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a ***GME Xmas special***.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6jl8ja5m9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca75f3bff938bac1627c1ee400d55464ca456fd

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kdsze7o5m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8508d2baf167f705145fe82387697042098998fa

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis  I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment***\*\*\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D***  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fktzhqb6m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89e04defb6c099bc4b9bc42ffbbb8a629c300ea

Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now  lets discuss the recent earnings

***Q321 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q321 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q321 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q321 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressureor at least thats what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q420) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopezs question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1u3gy7v7m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d297a98c6bf56b94befc9944e71213700183033

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance ***again and again and again*** (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p91sf7e8m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d80df51e444182c244f0223e67d9318508036043

So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC***  to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall)  ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.

Also, and more importantly ***successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/alw2qvp8m9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5186906e4e3721c278f3ada2060c45e75545f7ee

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medicalto name a few. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vz827099m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e5562ad7509cb6c31d88c1def5e4a05dcdd6bda

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA***  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary***  although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

1,"11/08/2021, 08:12:50",$HIMX - a huge potential value play. Extensive DD inside. Position posted,cool_BUD," 

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a *******GME Xmas special*****.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up.. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h50s60ugk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892a3056cf01889198bc457d8f82f6b8b400bfda

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays***  with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\- ***Other products*** in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iurexiwjk9y71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7815ba65eeac79d794ecfbb85ff070c59100a38d

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q321 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX***  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/phfpsc7lk9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105a9a81f695b40972159284b71221332b135fa3

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) ..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)***  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, thats the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the ***GME Xmas special***.

So, why do I mention a ***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*\*\*  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a ***GME Xmas special***.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wlec4jnlk9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7431b6338296b82f9ee58f4cd68efcf085006046

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8gur681mk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19567105edc88b46b8a5ecb1fb38f267d2f1a08

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis  I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment***\*\*\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D***  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fmymorlmk9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=263b1739f6cc3a650e588fdfc56d4b6738627e1c

Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now  lets discuss the recent earnings

***Q321 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q321 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q321 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q321 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressureor at least thats what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q420) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopezs question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7o5zrc2ok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ace07de87afe215430326d27d1167ffd4c658c

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance ***again and again and again*** (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s0yjfpkok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a10edbd9f81926ce7deae84be3ff51cda607343

So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC***  to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall)  ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.

Also, and more importantly ***successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vxurb10pk9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f96ab1778b831b523496516c34108fc13244e799

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medicalto name a few. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ezz84rgpk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eb5d23d015cff079b91d4871910d7cc5df88483

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA***  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary***  although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Lets squeeze this one dry. GME Xmas special.**

1,"11/08/2021, 08:09:45",$HIMX - a huge potential play - Extensive DD inside,cool_BUD,"\*\*$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TLDR:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

&amp;#x200B;

The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as \*\*\*stupid cheap\*\*\* with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have \*\*\*consistently delivered results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

&amp;#x200B;

..and now for the fun bit:

&amp;#x200B;

6. \*\*\*Potential for a significant short squeeze\*\*\*. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \*\*\*\*\*\*\*GME Xmas special\*\*\*\*\*.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

7. Cant confirm this (\*\*\*unconfirmed hearsay\*\*\*) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an \*\*\*Asian hedge fund\*\*\* which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up.. and it has already shot up \\\~15% last couple of weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What does $HIMX do? Products?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*High end Timing Controller \*\*\* which improves power efficiency in displays

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*WiseEye ultra power AI\*\*\* \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ \*\*\*AI and ML\*\*\* to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays\*\*\*  with usage in \*\*\*AR/VR glasses\*\*\*, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), \*\*\*Holographic Displays\*\*\*, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Other products\*\*\* in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Revenue by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing \\\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\\~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Competitors and Market Shares:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

In the Q321 presentation (available \[here\]([https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21\_HIMX-Investor-Presentation\_FInal.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf))), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

&amp;#x200B;

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*market share\*\*\* by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Smartphones: 10.4%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablets: 37.7%\*\*\* but note that \*\*\*$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share\*\*\* of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive OEM: 32.8%\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

&amp;#x200B;

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management \*\*\*foresaw\*\*\* that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

&amp;#x200B;

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX\*\*\*  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. \*\*\*When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),\*\*\* \[\*\*\*$HIMX\*\*\*\]([https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag\_click](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click)) \*\*\*walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This allowed it to \*\*\*take a decent amount of market share\*\*\* over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) ..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like \*\*\*Internet of Things (IoT)\*\*\* and \*\*\*Automotive/vehicles\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the \*\*\*modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)\*\*\* would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that \*\*\*this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly\*\*\*. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such \*\*\*5G and high performance computing (HPC)\*\*\*  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

&amp;#x200B;

However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, \*\*\*this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, thats the background\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Supply secured along with said demand.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear \*\*\*Short Squeeze\*\*\* candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \*\*\*GME Xmas special\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do I mention a \*\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\\~11 days to cover.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

&amp;#x200B;

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \*\*\*GME Xmas special\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, \*\*\*there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

&amp;#x200B;

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. \*\*\*I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the short-thesis  I really do.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I can personally find \*\*\*NO REASON\*\*\* to be short this stock anymore at least for the \*\*\*next 7 months\*\*\*, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a \*\*\*dividend payment\*\*\* in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But now, its time for a reversal.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).

&amp;#x200B;

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

&amp;#x200B;

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a \*\*\*dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. \*\*\*An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen \\\~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.

&amp;#x200B;

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

&amp;#x200B;

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 2 points worth noting:

&amp;#x200B;

1. \*\*\*Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment\*\*\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.

2. \*\*\*Reasonably capex-light business\*\*\*: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*R&amp;D\*\*\*  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Capex\*\*\* \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt the share price gone up then?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

&amp;#x200B;

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. \*\*\*The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. \*\*\*More on valuation at the end\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!\*\*\* Folks believe that this stock is \*\*\*manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)\*\*\* who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3 Earnings\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now  lets discuss the recent earnings

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q321 revenue\*\*\*: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q321 gross margin\*\*\*: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q321 EBITDA\*\*: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q321 Levered FCF\*\*\* of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

&amp;#x200B;

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep21 and YTD Sep21 are shown below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Why was the market waiting on guidance?\*\*\* Because indications were that:

&amp;#x200B;

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

&amp;#x200B;

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

&amp;#x200B;

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

&amp;#x200B;

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressureor at least thats what the shorts were betting on.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

&amp;#x200B;

\\+

&amp;#x200B;

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

&amp;#x200B;

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 revenue\*\*\* would \*\*\*INCREASE\*\*\* by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Gross margin\*\*\*: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 IFRS EPS\*\*\* (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q420) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 non IFRS EPS\*\*\* (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) \*\*\*but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, the \*\*\*margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect\*\*\* than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; \*\*\*a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.\*\*\* In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Lopezs question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to this question was pretty much that

&amp;#x200B;

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (\*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19\*), and

&amp;#x200B;

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \*\*\*again and again and again\*\*\* (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has \*\*\*consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say \*\*\*management is highly credible.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Top line guidance by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large DDIC\*\*\*  to \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* by \*\*\*high single digit q-o-q\*\*\* helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC\*\*\* (overall)  \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*low teens q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;50% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Smartphones\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*high teens q-o-q\*\*\* &amp; \*\*\*&gt;30% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablet\*\*\* \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*double-digit q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;100% yoy\*\*\*. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly within the \*\*\*Smartphone\*\*\* segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and more importantly \*\*\*successful engagements with some key customers\*\*\* have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. \*\*\*winning more market share.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Lots to like here.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

&amp;#x200B;

Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a \*\*\*non-DDIC segment\*\*\*\\\*,\\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for \*\*\*AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a \*\*\*design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application\*\*\* (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is \*\*\*on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)\*\*\*\*.\*

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the \*\*\*number of awarded projects\*\*\* in this segment is \*\*\*growing rapidly\*\*\*, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medicalto name a few. \*\*\*Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from \*\*\*cloud service providers\*\*\* who look for \*\*\*secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\*\*\*. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like \*\*\*smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

&amp;#x200B;

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

&amp;#x200B;

The \*\*\*average fair value\*\*\* on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*transaction comps\*\*\*, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents \*\*\*21x EV/EBITDA\*\*\*  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a \*\*\*FV of $54/share + 370% upside\*\*\*\\\*!\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Is $54/share possible here?\*\*\* Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a \*\*\*few steps ahead of competition\*\*\* with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

&amp;#x200B;

We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary\*\*\*  although, that is probably some time away.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lets squeeze this one dry. GME Xmas special.\*\*

1,"11/08/2021, 08:02:50",$HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special!,cool_BUD," 

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a *******GME Xmas special*****.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up.. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xauvd0foi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f100091008d982b11365eddb2f01cd44c01162e

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8hum9v7ri9y71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e61e336fbeff67b6e15b64833d98267991f78d6f

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q321 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ny3uxngsi9y71.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=972f8fc3828e7e89e6e30ad4810a444f2eecbf07

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX***  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dy2osq4ti9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7471bbecf7cdbbeae78af1c495e4dfc1c18cca08

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) ..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)***  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, thats the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the ***GME Xmas special***.

So, why do I mention a ***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*\*\*  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a ***GME Xmas special***.

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3idfre8ui9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4484efc50e8d9e3660213ecfcb05b2a828fbe2

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis  I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment***\*\*\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D***  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/06tfb03vi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca55057da0a7bbce8c10570cbf3b69f98cac9a8

Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now  lets discuss the recent earnings

***Q321 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q321 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q321 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q321 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep21 and YTD Sep21 are shown below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r3jo922wi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed04ce59353eb39eba145d03f6acd6de01549d6

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressureor at least thats what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q420) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopezs question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zvps6kwwi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1b237c9ee9fb86a957c78f5298eba51ac76f8fd

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance ***again and again and again*** (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/got3rshxi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5f649c842415a00feebddadb2d9d725450fc5f8

So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC***  to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall)  ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.

Also, and more importantly ***successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hytzjkzxi9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2040aa5b1ffb16b28ffd7400325710ed38126385

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medicalto name a few. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w0zr9jmyi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f94c1451776d96781b769bcb1c4d4d564f7eb67e

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA***  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary***  although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Lets squeeze this one dry. GME Xmas special.**

What's poppin' bull gang, hope youre all doing well! Weve got meme week ahead of us, meaning that were likely gonna see some fun price action combined with thousands of OTM calls getting turned to ash in an instant. Overall, I dont see too many appealing plays this week, but Ill still be sitting on the sidelines eagerly watching. Those who decide to trade this week are braver than I. Lets get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isnt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If youre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isnt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below Ive compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **There arent many appealing plays this week.** Everything is priced nicely, and there isnt any edge to be gained from the historical numbers. If you want to gain some edge, youll have to get a little creative and actually look into other forms of alternative data like user growth projections relative to google search density or something like that. Ill likely let Hungry Bot take the reigns this week since its the easier solution and has been extremely accurate this earnings season.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Lemonade has ONLY missed on earnings since its inception.** Across five quarters, $LMND has delivered five straight misses. Obviously past performance doesnt indicate future results, but the sample size is starting to stack up meaning weve got fairly nice odds on this trade. Options are priced to perfection so youve got no edge on the buy or sell side. Look to run debit or credit spreads to increase your potential profits and avoid IV crush if you decide to play. If I feel like lighting some money on fire, I may roll the dice on this one.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. Theres no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and youre just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that theyre buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesnt go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.

&amp;nbsp;

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isnt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below Ive compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **There arent many appealing plays this week.** Everything is priced nicely, and there isnt any edge to be gained from the historical numbers. If you want to gain some edge, youll have to get a little creative and actually look into other forms of alternative data like user growth projections relative to google search density or something like that. Ill likely let Hungry Bot take the reigns this week since its the easier solution and has been extremely accurate this earnings season.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Lemonade has ONLY missed on earnings since its inception.** Across five quarters, $LMND has delivered five straight misses. Obviously past performance doesnt indicate future results, but the sample size is starting to stack up meaning weve got fairly nice odds on this trade. Options are priced to perfection so youve got no edge on the buy or sell side. Look to run debit or credit spreads to increase your potential profits and avoid IV crush if you decide to play. If I feel like lighting some money on fire, I may roll the dice on this one.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what most are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. Theres no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and youre just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that theyre buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesnt go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.

As you can see, corn looks like its going to fucking explode. But this is WSB, corn isnt allowedwhat can we do to profit off this?

**Allow me to introduce $RIOT and $MARA.**

At its core, every business does one thing: turn energy into money. This is typically done via a combination of humans and machines using energy to create physical products, provide services, or create software. $RIOT and $MARA cut out all that nonsense. All their businesses do is fill warehouses with mining rigs, pump them full of energy, and turn that energy into cold, hard corn.

As we can see from the beautiful crayon art above, corn prices have been exploding, and should only accelerate through the end of the year. So what does that mean for $RIOT and $MARA? Since their businesses revolve entirely around corn and almost all of their assets are in corn, their share prices correlate very strongly to corns price. Lets take a look.

&amp;#x200B;

[$RIOT \(orange\) and $MARA \(blue\) compared to corn \(candles\)](https://preview.redd.it/ywghzqxzd9y71.png?width=2634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b543e814228861fe66264a763ef0fe254116570)

But wait, $RIOT and $MARA generally move 2-3x more than corn itself, why is that? I have no idea, and I dont really care. What matters for us is that if corn keeps exploding, $RIOT and $MARA will toolikely at a 2-3x rate of corn itself.

**BUT WAIT THERES MORE.**

If we use call options on these stocks, we increase our leverage even more. If corn does a conservative 3x over the next two months, $RIOT and $MARA will likely be 6-9x, and calls will increase that leverage even more (perhaps another 3x for more conservative strikes and over 10x for more degenerate strikes). **This brings the total estimated gains to somewhere between 5,300% and 26,900%not too bad.** And whats the worst that could happen? You lose all the money you put in? Big fucking deal. This play has more asymmetrical upside than anything Ive ever seen before and probably will see for a very long time.

**POSITIONS OR BAN: Right now, most of my holdings are in $RIOT 12/17 $33 calls, $RIOT 1/21/22 $33 and $35 calls; as well as $MARA 12/17 $70 calls and $MARA 1/21/22 $75 calls.**

However, as you can see from the crayons, corn is poised to go exponential, so as that begins to happen, I will sell these positions and move into further out of the money calls to maximize gains.

$RIOT and $MARA have earnings coming up the week of 11/15, and since all of their revenue and assets are based on corn, they should both have phenomenal reports as long as corns price stays high. This gives an opportunity for some of the degenerate, out-of-the-money, same-week-expiration calls this sub thrives on. $HUT, another corn mining company, has earnings on 11/11, so that should give us a good idea of what will happen to $RIOT and $MARA after their earnings.

When to sell? As of right now, I plan on completely exiting the play around Christmas, but that is subject to change. I highly recommend following TechDev\_52 on Twitter and watching his indicators for calling the corn top (not my account, and I dont know the guy. He just gives great analysis). As soon as his top indicators start hitting, Im out.

Many of the charts also predict a sharp dip in corn after it hits $84,000 sometime mid-November, so there may be potential to sell there and rebuy before the grand parabolic finale.

**Like I said at the beginning, everything I have learned about stocks and options came from this sub, so I am using this as my chance to give back. I have spent the past two years mastering the blade so that when opportunity flashed before me, I would have the tools necessary to maximize itand its finally here.**

I will be back around Christmas to post my gains and give out some Christmas presents. I hope to see you all there. Good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qp0vn8/riot_and_mara_dd_530026900_estimated_return/

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below Ive compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **There arent many appealing plays this week.** Everything is priced nicely, and there isnt any edge to be gained from the historical numbers. If you want to gain some edge, youll have to get a little creative and actually look into other forms of alternative data like user growth projections relative to google search density or something like that.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Lemonade has ONLY missed on earnings since its inception.** Across five quarters, $LMND has delivered five straight misses. Obviously past performance doesnt indicate future results, but the sample size is starting to stack up meaning weve got fairly nice odds on this trade. Options are priced to perfection so youve got no edge on the buy or sell side. Look to run debit or credit spreads to increase your potential profits and avoid IV crush if you decide to play. If I feel like lighting some money on fire, I may roll the dice on this one.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. Theres no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and youre just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that theyre buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesnt go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.

As you can see, corn looks like its going to fucking explode. But this is WSB, corn isnt allowedwhat can we do to profit off this? 

**Allow me to introduce $RIOT and $MARA.** 

At its core, every business does one thing: turn energy into money. This is typically done via a combination of humans and machines using energy to create physical products, provide services, or create software. $RIOT and $MARA cut out all that nonsense. All their businesses do is fill warehouses with mining rigs, pump them full of energy, and turn that energy into cold, hard corn. 

As we can see from the beautiful crayon art above, corn prices have been exploding, and should only accelerate through the end of the year. So what does that mean for $RIOT and $MARA? Since their businesses revolve entirely around corn and almost all of their assets are in corn, their share prices correlate very strongly to corns price. Lets take a look. 

&amp;#x200B;

[$RIOT \(orange\) and $MARA \(blue\) compared to corn \(candles\)](https://preview.redd.it/vowgc7c9a9y71.png?width=2634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cfbb5e89d26d642954d579b9e0e56f589164cd9)

But wait, $RIOT and $MARA generally move 2-3x more than corn itself, why is that? I have no idea, and I dont really care. What matters for us is that if corn keeps exploding, $RIOT and $MARA will toolikely at a 2-3x rate of corn itself. 

**BUT WAIT THERES MORE.** 

If we use call options on these stocks, we increase our leverage even more. If corn does a conservative 3x over the next two months, $RIOT and $MARA will likely be 6-9x, and calls will increase that leverage even more (perhaps another 3x for more conservative strikes and over 10x for more degenerate strikes). **This brings the total estimated gainz to somewhere between 5,300% and 26,000%not too bad.** And whats the worst that could happen? You lose all the money you put in? Big fucking deal. This play has more asymmetrical upside than anything Ive ever seen before and probably will see for a very long time. 

**POSITIONS OR BAN: Right now, most of my holdings are in $RIOT 12/17 $33 calls, $RIOT 1/21/22 $33 and $35 calls; as well as $MARA 12/17 $70 calls and $MARA 1/21/22 $75 calls.** 

However, as you can see from the crayons, corn is poised to go exponential, so as that begins to happen, I will sell these positions and move into further out of the money calls to maximize gainz. 

$RIOT and $MARA have earnings coming up the week of 11/15, and since all of their revenue and assets are based on corn, they should both have phenomenal reports as long as corns price stays high. This gives an opportunity for some of the degenerate, out-of-the-money, same-week-expiration calls this sub thrives on. $HUT, another corn mining company, has earnings on 11/11, so that should give us a good idea of what will happen to $RIOT and $MARA after their earnings. 

When to sell? As of right now, I plan on completely exiting the play around Christmas, but that is subject to change. I highly recommend following TechDev\_52 on Twitter and watching his indicators for calling the corn top (not my account, and I dont know the guy. He just gives great analysis). As soon as his top indicators start hitting, Im out. 

Many of the charts also predict a sharp dip in corn after it hits $84,000 sometime mid-November, so there may be potential to sell there and rebuy before the grand parabolic finale.

**Like I said at the beginning, everything I have learned about stocks and options came from this sub, so I am using this as my chance to give back. I have spent the past two years mastering the blade so that when opportunity flashed before me, I would have the tools necessary to maximize itand its finally here.** 

I will be back around Christmas to post my gainz and give out some Christmas presents. I hope to see you all there. Good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qp0pp8/riot_and_mara_dd_530026000_projected_gains/

Himax Trade Idea - Script
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatics Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021  as I write this, $HIMXs current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isnt part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatics opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yields read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company  trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more normal S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q421 and even Q122, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results to guidance for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year  representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short  and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan22 and Mar22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan22 and $10 Mar22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question  heres a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make panels which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller (TCON) which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays  with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary  the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each)  with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q321 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q321, $HIMXs market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets  the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific mature nodes for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same mature nodes, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX  not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well  as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC)  would also require components that use the same mature nodes that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage  which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isnt adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021  this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart  it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now  the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMXs inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, thats the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0  and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the GME Xmas special.
So, why do I mention a SHORT SQUEEZE  well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of short availability utilization. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a GME Xmas special.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR)  so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed  this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis  I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices  could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance  but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q421 and decent outlook for Q122) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay  much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q321, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July  so we have some time. But lets face it, everyone can do that math  and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely  potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously  and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance  so I wouldnt put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all  there will be significant upward pressure on the price  and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, its quite a surprise that the stock hasnt rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the Growth Bros: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question  and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses  meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is reinvestment. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D  including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their investment phase, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming  so, why hasnt
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21  when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasnt stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, its time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now  lets discuss the recent earnings
Q321 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q321 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q221 and vs 22.3% in Q320 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q321 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q  the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q321 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep21 and YTD Sep21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least thats what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMXs guidance, lets just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers)  which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q421 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q421 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan)  so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q420) of $0.195  i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q420) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
Its simple math, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMXs selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words  earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of surprise is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopezs question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17  FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers  making the demand for its products more defensive.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance again and
 again and again (yes, 3 agains specifically mentioned)  and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMXs historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings within guidance for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q117)  and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes  as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this again and again and again!!! Lets just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC  to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall)  GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMXs ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features.
Also, and more importantly successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMXs highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather)  which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...to name a few. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, companys WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himaxs valuation vs peers  note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers  with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables  representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7  representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA  which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely  as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We havent even discussed $HIMXs potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But Id say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and in the game, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary  although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

[Figure 1: Share Price plummeted +50&amp;#37; since earnings last Monday](https://preview.redd.it/ldzoinb6z3y71.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=121da3ed316553fac40126ca08444bb9667f5f20)

**Q3 Earnings (Last Monday)**

2018: 321M **Revenue** 

2019: 410M 

2020: 644M

2021: 762M (New Guidance) 

Cheggs total subscribers fell to 4.4 million, an unexpected decline from 4.86 million in the previous quarter.

**Why it will rebound**

**Chegg Institutional Ownership (Q3) : 97.12%**

[ Figure 2: Largest Institutional Ownership Data from Q2  ](https://preview.redd.it/dg46n06gz3y71.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37fc03e025cabdbc8c905c998183ab739ccef9ee)

The value was based on a $90 share price. Q3 Value should be a third as of today

[Figure 3: New Analyst Ratings since recent earnings range from $49-$56 with an average of $52 \(72&amp;#37; upside\)](https://preview.redd.it/5ztwwyutz3y71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b639b061145a1234e3faac12304a0b23b7967ede)

**Total Net Shares Traded --&gt; +426,031 shares**  (roughly $13.6M)

$335M worth of shares have already been bought. In addition to the 500M increase, there is still $665M left to buy shares.  Likely to commence soon --&gt; **They will finesse these prices.**

I am currently a third-year college student in the engineering field and Chegg has been tremendous to myself and my peers. For all you **boomers** who only read about Chegg and never used it, the majority of people dont actually use it to **cheat**. Even before covid, we use Chegg to see the textbook solution for tough stem classes like physics to fully and efficiently grasp the concepts and steps involved in solving the problem. Think of it as a **solution manual for hundreds of courses.** 

I currently have $500k in shares, $22k+ naked puts, and some OTM calls in my IRA. Ive started with $30k and only traded momentum/swing trades to get to this point and this is **one of my highest conviction plays.**

My **price target** for the end of the year is a generous and conservative **$40.** (two months for 25%+ upside)

I am thinking of getting more money together with a couple of people and buy some land in Europe. I am 24, got like 30 grand to spend + have tight connections to politicians (uncles, grandpas etc.).

My question is = can I create something in the US to collect $$$ from people and invest that money in EU? How does that work in terms of law? Do I need to open a business / fund here in the US, or as long as people trust me, they can just send me money and we are good? I have a business open in EU, employed in the US.

Please let me know if you know of some 3rd parties doing this, perhaps this would be a better business idea.

**Example:**

Let's say I've got a land to buy for $300k in total, including taxes and forex fee, local real estate firm fee (or bought directly from the owner).

I create a website where people can buy % shares of the land (like ecommerce website). e.g. 10% = 30,000 USD etc. If we collect 100% of the sum, I will go and buy the land in EU (forex difference accounted).

In 5 years, the land costs 500k. People can go and sell their ownership, e.g. 10% of 30k is now worth 50k.

HOW DOES THIS WORK LEGALLY? I AM NOT LOOKING AT THE TRUST / SALES point of view, rather than the legal way.

The Mastercard deal is what sent Bakkt running.

1,"11/08/2021, 04:55:04","Why Elon Musk is fooling the EVERYONE with his poll, and why I believe TSLA will have a massive gamma squeeze.",Bebettereveryday21,"Good afternoon everyone, 

Elon Musk created a poll yesterday stating, "" Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock. I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes."" 

The poll finished with 58% saying yes, so therefore Elon will now sell 10% of his stock which is equivalent to about $20,000,000,000. 

Individuals in the trading community will now be buying puts/shorts (betting the stock will go down) in anticipation of this stock sale. However Elon Musk has been notorious in trapping short sellers all his life, and has publicly announced how much he dislikes $TSLA short sellers. 

After thinking about this poll further, I remembered watching a video of Elon Musk at CodeCon 2021 in September ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESIjxVudERY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESIjxVudERY) ) at the 38:00 minute mark Elon starts talking about the controversy around his personal taxes, and mentions how his cash compensation is $0, and all his money is tied up in Tesla stock and Tesla options. 

For those who know about options are aware that all options have an expiration date and either before or on the date of expiration if the contract is in the money - it must be executed (sold). In the interview, Elon Musk states he has a bunch of call options that he will be FORCED to sell in Q4. 

We are currently in Q4, which means Elon was selling his stocks regardless of what the poll results were going to be, but he is making it look to the public as if they are making the choice for him. 

Before I get into my theory - I would like to first give definitions of some terms I will be using, and some other facts. 

Gamma Short Squeeze - Gamma squeezes can occur as the result of widespread speculation about where a stocks price may be headed. For example, if a company is struggling financially then institutional investors may decide to short the stock in the belief that the price will fall.That isnt out of the ordinary but what is unusual is when a group of investors or a single large institutional investor starts buying up stock, resulting in a short squeeze. For example, January 2021 saw an increase in short squeeze activity surrounding several companies, including [GameStop Corp.](https://smartasset.com/investing/gamestop-stock-price-surge-stock-market-lessons)(GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC).

Stock Split - A stock split is **when a company's board of directors issues more shares of stock to its current shareholders without diluting the value of their stakes**. ... While the number of shares outstanding change, the overall valuation of the company and the value of each shareholder's stake remains the same.

**In 2020, when Tesla announced a split, Shares of Tesla closed 13.12% higher Wednesday as investors continued to rally on the companys five-for-one stock split announced on Tuesday.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, getting into my theory of what I believe is going to happen.

Elon Musk knew he was forced to sell a huge block of options in Q4, and purposely announced on Twitter what he was going to do so hedge funds and individuals open up massive shorts for Tesla on Monday 11/08/2021 in anticipation of the stock going down from his sell which would open a huge short float on Tesla (kind of similar to GME and AMC before the massive gamma squeeze that occurred for the stock). 

While everyone is buying puts and betting the stock goes down on Monday November 8th, On Tuesday, November 9th Tesla has a scheduled shareholders meeting in which I believe they will announce a stock split like they did last year. 

Last year Tesla went up 13% the day they announced the stock split, and Elon knows if everyone has open put positions from Monday, and Tesla announces a stock split on Tuesday, there will be a HUGE gamma squeeze because the short sellers will be forced to buy back at a much higher price (exactly similar to GME, AMC). 

Elon has been notorious for trapping short sellers, as he did last year when he tweeted ""TSLA price is too high IMO."" This caused many people to open short positions (including myself) and then later he announced the stock was splitting which caused a huge rally in the ensuing days and months.

&amp;#x200B;

**THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND I AM NOT A FINANCIAL EXPERT** however I believe this is a huge opportunity and if it does play out in the next week or even in the next few weeks, there will be potential for an enormous amount of gains to be made. 

I believe TSLA call options will be down extremely heavy tomorrow, possibly -50-80% and it is not bad idea to buy some call options for this week and even until the end of the year, because if this plays out, the gains will be massive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qoxlov/why_elon_musk_is_fooling_the_everyone_with_his/

1,"11/08/2021, 04:04:24",$ROOT - disruptive insurance tech stock with 40+% SI and strong support at current price.,gudsamaritan,"# I strong believe that ROOT is the best squeeze play in the upcoming month. Here's why.

# 1. I like the stock. Disruptive insurance tech app that helps people save money on car insurance.

Compared to normal agent-based insurance companies like Warren Buffett's GEICO, Root is an app that analyses each driver and gives them a price appropriate to their risk and focus ratings. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jB49HeZbU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jB49HeZbU4) Here is a video of their lead data scientist explaining exactly how the tech works.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRT\_DshZqRk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRT_DshZqRk) Read the comments on videos like this, and talk to your friends who use car insurance. The savings by using Root are astronomical compared to traditional insurance companies.

This is an amazing opportunity. The global motor insurance market is about \~800B, and projected to reach 1T by 2027. At Root's current market cap of 1.2B, they have huge potential for disruption.

# 2. Oversold with 40+% Short Interest but with a support at all-time lows. 

[They've been getting destroyed in the past year by shorts.](https://preview.redd.it/ii3wfr7ob8y71.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=697a5e0e702baff5d7eb1818809a0fa50c5a82c0)

Why are they shorting it? Well, here's the bear case.

*In short* (haha), their losses have been increasing, while growth has not been explosive. They have competitors (Lemonade), their loss ratio (how much insurance they pay out) has increased, and their marketing spending has been rather high. These have resulted in negative EPS each quarter. Here's an even more detailed look on the bear thesis: [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/insurtech-startup-root-is-growing-like-a-weed](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/insurtech-startup-root-is-growing-like-a-weed)

[ This has resulted in a short interest of 40+&amp;#37;. ](https://preview.redd.it/ekp8tu9ub8y71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7c9bb7647fbc4d153e17fad517de81f2973da8e)

[ All time low \(support?\) at 4.63 ](https://preview.redd.it/k3ay3dkvb8y71.png?width=1484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c922d10d6035985d60e6a1124673281951d37196)

 What's the bull case then? This brings me to point number 3. 

#  3. The Reversal Play

Root is a early-stage tech company. Growth is the most important for determining the value of a technology stock. And Root has great potential for growth.

Root's direct written premiums (insurance sold) increased by 24% year over year to $177 million last quarter, indicating strong growth. Root's P/S ratio is **4.5** while Lemonade's P/S ratio is **45.** This shows that Root is undervalued.

Root also announced a partnership with Carvana (a used car reselling company) to bundle insurance into their vehicle sales. CFO Dan Rosenthal called this a massive opportunity, and the best part is there will be no marketing costs involved. Carvana has bought $120+ million of their shares at $9.00, for a 5% ownership in Root. And even with all this, they have still been shorting the stock down.

The best thing for the future? Root's telematics data systems. They are working with car manufacturers to embed chips in new vehicles that can directly and more accurately measure a driver's risk ratings. Imagine if they start collaborating with Tesla to give out insurance packaged with the car, at a low cost with perfect accuracy? This is literally the future of car insurance.

Seeing how $CAR has increased revenue drastically this Q3 due to summer causing a surge of car rentals, I think it's a good sign for other companies in the motor industry. And Root will be my pick with its massive short interest for a beautiful reversal play into Christmas.

Just Energy (JE on NYSE until 2021  now JENGQ in OTC Pink and JE on TSX), you apes. This is the multinational energy company(1) driven to bankruptcy by the ice storm in Texas earlier this year (2), though other companies were affected too.

Pros:

\- The price is way, way, way, way down but they arent giving up.

\- They still have most of their sales (7).

\- The state of Texas is providing massive financial assistance (to the tune of 100 million USD) to Just Energy so they get that nice TBTF safety net (4).

\- They do infrastructure  demand will always be there.

\- They do Texas infrastructure. The Texas power grid is more of an island than most of the nation (3).  

\- They clearly really, really like making money, but seem to not be Enron-level complete batshit evil/ doing anything illegal.

\- Governor announced the TX grid is fixed (5).

Cons:

\- This is not a company that talks about saving the world. They have ex-Enron execs and per Wikipedia, they have been accused of aggressive selling of consumer-unfriendly insurance products. If you only invest in hippie or hippie-signalling companies, this aint for you.  

\- They do Texas infrastructure. The Texas power grid is more of an island than most of the nation (3).  

\- Governor announced the TX grid is fixed (5).

\- They stopped dividends (6).

Wild card:  

\- Mysterious 14% pump recently (8). Probably professional investors pretending to be dirty, filthy apes. Did they feel guilty or ashamed? The answer is yes. Anyway I dont know what happened here - you make a guess.

They are being very transparent about the state of affairs and even went so far as to address a stock price increase so everyone knew they didnt know the cause.

1,"11/08/2021, 02:51:32",Meta and what we can expect from a different perspective,SeaWorldliness2068,"So the Meta - Facebook thing people have different opinions on it.

There are some obvious things that suggest it is a good move.

We people of the internet, tend to forget things fast.
And we all have that idea of a clean up.

You just delete things you wrote, posted in past and at some point it will be forgotten. So why not do it with the one of the most famous companies, and one of the biggest social media in the world.
Forgotten when? We will see.

And the thing with Oculus and their other projects.

What the actual fuck (over exaggerated intro).
Where is the beautiful idea we all dreamt of be able to play video games with the VR, better experience, more adventures.

Main pitch you will be able to work from home in a office with VR. NO, NOO, NO, HELL NO!

All them fancy tools, plugins that track your productivity, mouse movement tracking, are lil baby for their product.

Can you imagine being able to track someone better 4 times, than litterly having a person checking them full time, how much would it cost to do something like that?

A fucking lot, and would it be 100% accurate? No.

So why is the Facebook 20% loaded atm?

Because with their development, they will be the best tool and service for most of the companies worldwide.

They have no competition basically, and they ruined our dreams of cool VR's, and made them a corporate worlds wet dream come true.

Will they have shitload of clients, you can fucking bet they will.
Will they be efficient with expectations, and results, you can double bet on that as well.

Mine point here is simple, they will make it happend.
We will be left hanging for many more years with hopes of proper gaming future experience.

What can we do about it?
Maybe make some easy money of, of it.

Based on my meta DD post, I would say just about everyone in here is a Meta bear. But Im an ultra-bull on the stock and willing to put my money where my mouth is. I will bet $1000 (up to 10 times) that meta stock will hit 500/share (\~46.5% increase in an already 1T company) before the end of 2023. If you idiots really think meta is a shit company than show me how big your dick is and take my free money.

Aside from Meta being fundamentally undervalued my short term bull thesis is this. I am graciously providing this as an opportunity for retards to at least get a glimpse of my thesis before throwing down bets since nobody will actually read the DD post:

**The VR explosion:** Its already happening and its accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and its starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023.

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moores law to the computer chip. Its been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if its lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

I don't hold any TSLA directly nor do I have any options because I hate money and I have a small PP, but that's beside the point. 

SPY continues to hit new ATH week after week. I'm in heavy on SPY calls this week and am starting to get a little nervous that Musky E is going to let TSLA dip, which might cause people to sell, which could hurt my SPY calls. 

SPY is only 1.44% TSLA according [to this reputable link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/). I am polling you retards - will Elon's sale of TSLA stock hurt TSLA bulls.. will that hurt roll onto SPY or is just a fart in the wind? 

If we wanted to make this part of a larger discussion we could talk about how much any one holding can impact an ETF generally. What if AMZN has a really good day and AAPL has a really shitty day? Does it cancel out? Maybe people will pull back on all kinds of tech shit once they see TSLA dip a little bit. Is there any correlation?

# Fractals

As any of you psychedelic abusers are sure to know nature loves a good fractal. Your Romanesco Broccoli, your river deltas, your dendritic copper crystals. Fractals are everywhere, because math is everywhere. No matter how far you zoom in or out, the patterns always the same, and infinite. And guess what? The stock market is no exception. The GME curve is itself a fractal. It repeats all the way to the all time chart, and all the way down to the sub second. The graph is built into itself. Which is very handy if youre trying to go long, or short, assets over the course of years, while also high frequency trading ahead of retails order flow at the sub second level.

Now its all well and good to say its a fractal, but we need the deets. So lets deets.

## 3 cycle pattern

[The Tricycle Pattern](https://preview.redd.it/q52cs9llf7y71.jpg?width=1305&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d8592cf5521168d5fa195d9be52521c5b0faf9)

Each cycle is made of a tricycle at the next level of magnification down. The first instance of the subcycle is the tallest in price range and the quickest in time. This is the smash and grab that gets your best profit. The second cycle is the goldilocks of being just normal looking as to avoid suspicion. The highers are lower, and the lows are higher. Finally we have the third cycle. It takes so long as to be mind-numbingly boring, with very little price movement. Heres where we consolidate before we launch into the next cycle.

The curve of price range decreasing against length increasing can be given by the simple formula:

[Bear growth function](https://preview.redd.it/pma4ujkqf7y71.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a8fd1100fc5caef720ce080832ced265e14ee7)

&amp;#x200B;

And the picture for the smooth brains:

[Bear growth graph](https://preview.redd.it/yzr5fkbsf7y71.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2be412507cb61c8b43bd1f1e26921a4aed207c5)

&amp;#x200B;

As we come out of the peak of the spike starting cycle 1 from y approaching infinity, the price range of subsequent subcycles in the same cycle will slide down this line, and when the price range finally hits 0, the next cycle kicks off.

Now the smart amongst you will realise But that chart only goes down, how do you know how fast itll go up? And youre exactly right! If we have the bear growth function of cycle length and time, wheres the bull growth function? Thankfully you wont need to remember another long scary string of numbers. Its the same line, only it approaches the wall of tendies, instead of sliding away, and its 5/12ths the length. Why 5/12ths? Fuck you, ask nature, I didnt code this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if we put those two graphs together what we have is the underlying ratio at the heart of the GME curve

[Bull growth function](https://preview.redd.it/g1s457lvf7y71.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b6a16f2e9126b524a7b6b2a3b4fa5c390fbfc86)

&amp;#x200B;

[Bull growth graph](https://preview.redd.it/mljby5wxf7y71.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4ff91678facef0d4aeb171a4e7fe26e51aff851)

[The 5:12 Bull to Bear ratio](https://preview.redd.it/5xv6rcb2g7y71.jpg?width=1499&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0214e864b1ed1ba3c8ccc878fb4d8e6c7d8c8aae)

Every 5 units of time we squeeze up, and every 12 units of time we flatten out ready for the next squeeze. Everything that line very nearly touches (0, infinity), and everytime it slams off y=0. Of course it could never hit (0, infinity), thats your financial divide by 0 right there.

## 

[Combined Bull\/Bear cycle](https://preview.redd.it/3thjzfz6g7y71.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ee88098794457b9ff850f6aac8ec5b9734a4e8)

So its all well and good to discover that nature and the financial markets are a math nerd, but what can we actually do with it? Remember way back I said the cycle was deterministic? That means we can make some pretty accurate predictions. Heres how we know if we need to get second mortgage, or a first yacht.

## The Up Cycle

&amp;#x200B;

[Uptrend Tricycle](https://preview.redd.it/lxmnkxicg7y71.jpg?width=2163&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5da5cd7a6bde9010e90f5c67473639ae3d2e332b)

In the uptrend our same understandings of the 3 subcycles remain true, lengths and widths of each circle conform to our graphs. But the placement is key here. In an uptrend, the peak of 2 will be lower than 1, and when 3 enters its climax its amplified by nature of being the climax of its parent cycle. These are where your true moonshots lie, when you hit multiple layers of 3 finishing together. The uptrend cycle doubles also as the FLY ME TO THE MOON stage of its parent cycle.

## The Down Cycle

&amp;#x200B;

[Downtrend tricyle](https://preview.redd.it/smg4b3lgg7y71.jpg?width=2625&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec6d8f077c91c37a27151e6befbedb40620d24cd)

In the downtrend, the peak of the two is going to be higher than the peak of the 1, and when the 3 falls into its hopes dashed stage it is amplified by the hopes dashed of any parent 3s. The downtrend doubles as the hopes dashed stage of its parent cycle.

These can be simplified with the shapes:

&amp;#x200B;

So now that we know what bullish and bearish cycles look like, what does a bullish and bearish all time look like

There may have been a point where fundamental analysis actually meant anything, but its not in my lifetime. Fundamental analysis done by anyone who isnt you, is a psyop marketing push to make you a bag holder after the stock/coin has already had its climax, and the times only get worse from here. Fundamental analysis is less than worthless, it is actively harmful to any worthwhile trading strategy. In the Gilded age of Speculation, it doesnt matter if the company ever profit, or what the company even does. Something blockchain, here comes the angel investors with the buckets of money. Technical analysis is the only game in town and the Hedgies know it. So how do they profit from a deterministic graph that is public information. FUD, Aftermarket, and the secret ingredient crime.

No, Elon isnt going to not sell his shares if the twitter poll loses. Hes seen the graph and knows hes hit the peak of the beginning of the 1 cycle, and Tesla is about to crash and hard. Twitter is just a scapegoat so it seems like the crash has a catalyst.

I cant stress this enough. The movement on the chart happens first, and then catalysts are invented, not the other way around.

They have their stooges working in the finance media telling you to bet the farm on Bear Sterns 2 days before they buy the farm. If anyone anywhere, who you dont know, is trying to sell you on a stock they are not to be trusted.

Wouldnt it be such a lucky coincidence for hedgies if the low points of the cycle hit during market hours, and the most profitable parts during market open. 

[November 3rd GME](https://preview.redd.it/sae92989h7y71.png?width=2445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b46cc878826a786514f0704120e32d58c31d19a)

&amp;#x200B;

While this one was fresh in your mind. The end of multiple 3 cycles happened during after hours on November 2nd, resulting in that huge after hours spike. The price falls just enough during after market for the consolidation of and completion of a subcycle, before completing even more 3s on top of each other, right out of the opening bell, just so we could catch the 1 of a new larger cycle, and experience the massive crash price range that comes with a 1.

And how much did that cost the hedgies to do?

[November 4th AT&amp;T ](https://preview.redd.it/4jhnfhueh7y71.png?width=2447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98bb155b6af2e94f9edff655e21b6a1eaca950ab)

While GME was peaking, AT&amp;T, which Citadel are long on, and increased their position in tenfold since March, dropped pretty hard into its own consolidation. Looks to me like someone had to take a whole lot of profit all at once. But why not try and fleece retail while were at it. Bet we all noticed the sudden influx of people talking about BBBY along with that after hours spike. Billion dollar share buyback, theyre becoming the catalyst themselves. Do you hear that?

&amp;#x200B;

[November 3rd BBY](https://preview.redd.it/udrm9m5ph7y71.png?width=2448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b26403a717af75ca24ce1e053cb8ba2d29e96c)

Thats the sound of anyone who thought it was a good idea to diversify into BBBY taking an absolute bath after a brief smash and grab shill campaign to try and get some apes to buy BBY into a losing subcycle.

So then what is the catalyst? Buy and hold? DRS? Loopring?

I remind you, fundamentals dont matter. All that matters is the graph.

The catalyst is a date, but not like any of the dates you know.

April 3rd, 2020, 5:30pm.

# The Day The Money Died

[April 3rd 2020, 5:30pm](https://preview.redd.it/8c0o9p6wh7y71.png?width=1526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a34b111b7d936012b59b467da48f64eacde8a4eb)

Whatss so important about this date?

When you zoom out just far enough, the GME curve has the same flow of shape as the 5:12 growth decurve functions. When an asset is in an upswing, its in its 5 until it reaches the peak of its 1 cycle, and falls into its 12. We all know Citadel have naked shorted Gamestop into oblivion. They tried to force the 12 downtrend to go down as hard as it could. If the price reaches 0, and Gamestop goes bankrupt, its maximum profit for the hedgies. So all they had to do was get it to reach 0 before the 12 curve bounces of the x-axis.

They made just one fatal mistake. They didnt read the graph.

[All time Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/zywqbtj2i7y71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54539e1f1bb46e48f1bc83ebc40e25b3d6e021c3)

&amp;#x200B;

April 3rd was the day we bounced of the x-axis of our 12, and moved into the uptrend of our 5. It was the day the squeeze became inevitable, and the day Citadel died.

Kenny, not only did you not take notice that the top of your current cycle was below the top of the previous 1, meaning youre in an uptrend. You massively naked shorted a stock to astronomical levels right into its build up of the start of a bigger length of time cycle 1 than Gamestop has been a stock for. You didnt bury the company into the ground. You shorted enough critical mass to make a black hole. Cohen saw it, DFV saw it, and now we see it. Thanks for the gravitational slingshot straight to the moon, youll be seeing us from your prison cell.

# How I learned to stop worrying

So where do we go from here?

If you want some predictions based on TA, stick around otherwise

TL;DR: MOASS INEVITABLE

&amp;#x200B;

[GME with Cycles](https://preview.redd.it/4yrkvrp6i7y71.png?width=2443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0b797cb69dd96185ee3f1c63ed63bd47f306a8)

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently in the first leap up in the build up at the end of cycle 3. This cycle 3 is also the end of cycle 1. The top of cycle 2 didnt exceed cycle 1, so we are still in an uptrend. This cycle 1-3 ending will shoot us up below the top of the January sneeze if we continue to be in an uptrend and havent bounced off the y axis, otherwise it it exceeds the January sneeze and doesnt continue climbing into MOASS, I expect the uptrend to have reversed into a downtrend. This cycle 2 will be longer, consult the 12 line to deduce how much longer, and then a longer again 3 until we complete the next super cycle. My understanding is that the scenario where Citadel finally collapses and can no longer constrain GME to the GME curve, is when we finally achieve the never achieved (x=0,y=infinity) of the 5:12 model.

When the number of wrinkles on the brain approaches infinity, it is indistinguishable from a smooth brain

# How I learned to worry again

MOASS is inevitable. Kenny is fucked by math, and he cant crime his way out of it. But I would be remiss to say its all sunny uplands ahead.

Gamestop is undoubtedly in an uptrend, and will MOASS, and DRS and buy and holding is increasing the powder keg of our next cycle end.

But GME is the exception. The purchasing power of the dollar is fast approaching y=0, and somehow I dont think its going to bounce off.

The inflation levels are only on the first spike up on the build up stage, and going by 1980s method of calculating inflation, were sitting pretty precariously at 10%.

[S&amp;P500 all time](https://preview.redd.it/a6i3ssy9i7y71.png?width=2449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2970c1fa92e336a8f5484d501ef6ceb81e7ec642)

&amp;#x200B;

What goes up must come down. The market looks at this graph and sees fantastic returns, healthy economy, party never stops. I look at this graph and I see the incoming all time high, for good, the bull trap, and the bear trap meaning not just the crash of the global economy. But the 100 year uptrend, reversing in to a downtrend 12/5ths as long. I dont know about you, but Id hate to be a person using, holding, or being paid with money anytime in the next 240+ years.

All the people at the top, who get paid very good money to listen to the direction of the music got too distracted by exploiting short term gains, breaking all the laws and rules in pursuit of more money than a person could ever dream to spend in a life time,  more money than our brains are capable of conceptualising appropriately. 

And they didnt notice that the music stopped.

Apes, it has been a privilege holding with you this year.

They also recently created partnerships with three major retailers worldwide. They've begun selling their machines in Virgin Megastores in the United Arab Emirates, 750 Best Buy locations in the US, and 500 Staples locations in the US. They have a massive online following of Becky's, with over 1.4 million followers on Instagram, and a huge presence on Facebook, Etsy, and Pinterest. This is anecdotal, but I've spoken to a few friends who sell on Etsy, and they swear by Cricut. One of the biggest draws of Critcut is the fact that you can build very successful businesses on their platform, and their ecosystem contains all the pieces needed to make money. Very attractive to the essential oil selling, Amway believing demographic. So we have a well-run business with a passionate user base that has seen very solid growth over the past couple years. All good reasons to invest, but here is the interesting part.

&amp;#x200B;

It has 208 million shares outstanding, but the public float is ONLY 20.8 million. For comparison, UPST has a public float of 54 million. I chose UPST for comparison because of the 150%+ runs it went on after its earnings. I'm not saying CRCT will do something similar, but I think it is possible, and here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ui5hvf2ih7y71.png?width=383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83a64f3f0bce701f0f9c749a16e8b247ddecc751

Ortex has the short interest at 22.41%, with 4.65 million shares of the 20 million share float loaned out. Not astronomical, but pretty high. A significant spike in buying as a result of stellar earnings could catch those shorts with their dicks in their hands, and send CRCT skyrocketing as they try to scramble for shares to stop the bleeding. And remember, there aren't many shares to be had, because the vast majority of the shares outstanding are locked up with institutions.

Here are the major holders. Some big names for sure, but its the top one that I want to point out. Abdiel capital is a hedge fund run by Colin Moran and Geoff Gentile. They are both Ivy League educated, and worked for Goldman and Barclays respectively before starting Abdiel. Much smarter than me, and their fund manages over 5 billion in assets. Over the past couple months, they have been buying CRCT at a super aggressive pace.

Every B on that graph is a large buy order from Abdiel. They now own 600 million dollars worth of stock. I'm also assuming that they have bought more since mid-September, and it hasn't been reported yet.

The stock tanked after its earnings on August 12, even after beating big on both EPS and revenue. The CFO cautioned that Q3 would not be as good and did not offer guidance, citing that people are staying home less from the economy reopening. Wall Street fucking hates when companies don't offer guidance because it means uncertainty, so it sold off. The EPS estimate for Q3 is 0.16, which is well below its reported number of 0.22 on August 12. Additionally, revenue is expected to be at 256 million, well below the 334 million reported for Q2. The bar is set low....

One thing I want to point out is on August 13, the day of the 25% sell off, Abdiel made their largest purchase to date of 1.5 million shares. Over the course of the next week, they bought about an additional 1 million+ shares, clearly indicating their conviction in their play.

I don't have a position in CRCT yet as I've been researching this for the past couple days. I'm currently in DIS and AMC calls. I'll decide what to do tomorrow based on how everything is looking, but I'll definitely begin scaling in. The spreads are a bit wide on way OTM options, but tighten up the closer you get to the money. I'm probably going to do 40% shares, 40% close to the money Dec calls, and 20% lotto $50 Dec calls.

1,"11/08/2021, 01:08:42",Could $DASH be a good long?,GreenDildoSurprise,"DoorDash has earnings Nov 9 and my first thought was that they'd be a good short given that everything is reopening. But a quick Google search makes me think this actually might be a good long. I haven't seen any chatter around them? Any info you could share? I've only spent \~30 minutes looking into this, but the initial search seems very positive.

Why do I think it might be a good long? Well, Uber beat their earnings estimate and as [this analysis](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/uber-posts-first-ever-adjusted-profit-as-drivers-return) points out, UberEats was a major reason why. Also, as [this analysis](https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/food-delivery-services-grubhub-uber-eats-doordash-postmates/) shows, food delivery has been increasing in general in 2021, DoorDash has the most loyal customers, and when customers order through DoorDash they spend more money than when they order through their competitors. DoorDash also [started delivering alcohol](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/20/doordash-will-soon-deliver-alcohol-to-customers.html) in September, so they'll likely have some additional revenue from that.

Also, DASH had a sudden recent price drop on 10/26, leaving them more room to run up if they do have positive earnings:

The IV on DASH is pretty high, but Nov 12 200/202.5 spreads are only $1.08, making them &gt;2x and 215/217.5 spreads are 0.53 only making them \~5x if you want to take on more risk. $DASH was In the 215-220 range before the drop, so both plays area realistic if the ER is positive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qosv37/could_dash_be_a_good_long/

Cricut designs and markets a creativity platform that enables users to create professional looking handmade goods. They have three main revenue streams: connected machines, subscriptions, and accessories/materials. The company provides connected machines, design apps, and accessories and materials for users to create personalized birthday cards, mugs, T-shirts, and large-scale interior decorations under the Cricut brand. The subscriptions(Wall Street fucking loves subscriptions) allow users to access a library of images, fonts, and other features.

They also recently created partnerships with three major retailers worldwide. They've begun selling their machines in Virgin Megastores in the UAE, 750 Best Buy locations in the US, and 500 Staples locations in the US. They have a massive online following of Becky's, with over 1.4 million followers on Instagram, and a huge presence on Facebook, Etsy, and Pinterest. This is anecdotal, but I've spoken to a few friends who sell on Etsy, and they swear by Cricut. One of the biggest draws of Critcut is the fact that you can build very successful businesses on their platform, and their ecosystem contains all the pieces needed to make money. Very attractive to the essential oil selling, Amway believing demographic. So we have a well-run business with a passionate user base that has seen very solid growth over the past couple years. All good reasons to invest, but here is the interesting part.

It has 208 million shares outstanding, but the public float is ONLY 20.8 million. For comparison, UPST has a public float of 54 million. I chose UPST for comparison because of the 150%+ runs it went on after its earnings. I'm not saying CRCT will do something similar, but I think it is possible, and here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4p8u00jcg7y71.png?width=383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b55416301e857f086a446d9154f078e02e30247

Ortex has the short interest at 22.41%, with 4.65 million shares of the 20 million share float loaned out. Not astronomical, but pretty high. A significant spike in buying as a result of stellar earnings could catch those shorts with their dicks in their hands, and send CRCT skyrocketing as they try to scramble for shares to stop the bleeding. And remember, there aren't many shares to be had, because the vast majority of the shares outstanding are locked up with institutions.

Here are the major holders. Some big names for sure, but its the top one that I want to point out. Abdiel capital is a hedge fund run by Colin Moran and Geoff Gentile. They are both Ivy League educated, and worked for Goldman and Barclays respectively before starting Abdiel. Much smarter than me, and their fund manages over 5 billion in assets. Over the past couple months, they have been buying CRCT at a super aggressive pace.

Every B on that graph is a large buy order from Abdiel. They now own 600 million dollars worth of stock. I'm also assuming that they have bought more since mid-September, and it hasn't been reported yet.

The stock tanked after its earnings on August 12, even after beating big on both EPS and revenue. The CFO cautioned that Q3 would not be as good and did not offer guidance, citing that people are staying home less from the economy reopening. Wall Street fucking hates when companies don't offer guidance because it means uncertainty, so it sold off. The EPS estimate for Q3 is 0.16, which is well below its reported number of 0.22 on August 12. Additionally, revenue is expected to be at 256 million, well below the 334 million reported for Q2. The bar is set low....

One thing I want to point out is on August 13, the day of the 25% sell off, Abdiel made their largest purchase to date of 1.5 million shares. Over the course of the next week, they bought about an additional 1 million+ shares, clearly indicating their conviction in their play.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a position in CRCT yet as I've been researching this for the past couple days. I'm currently in DIS and AMC calls. I'll decide what to do tomorrow based on how everything is looking, but I'll definitely begin scaling in. The spreads are a bit wide on way OTM options, but tighten up the closer you get to the money. I'm probably going to do 40-50% shares, 30% close to the money Dec calls, and 20% lotto $50 Dec calls. If you're a gambler, I think Nov $35 calls are the way to go. Best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qost3u/crct_dd_potential_squeeze_play/

1,"11/08/2021, 01:02:02",Why do people hate the rich/corporations?,apolloandbackk,"I never understood the idea that the rich are all bad people and dont deserve the money they made. Most of the people saying this immediately switch sides the second they make a significant amount of money, and even then they might still clamor that billionaires are bad and should pay more in taxes, while not wanting to pay taxes themselves. 

If you invest into a company, buy their product, even get a job at the companywell then you have nothing to complain about, because youre helping these people you hate make more money. 

Also, if the government took *every * single asset the top 1% own, and then add it up, it comes out to roughly 4 trillion dollars, which isnt even enough to run the United States for a single year. 

The issue is the government increases corporate taxes which makes businesses pay their employees less due to the increase in taxes they owe, combined with the average spending amount the company already uses per year. What ends up happening is that because the employees are now paid less these employees then have less money to invest into assets themselves or buy products in the economy, which in turn hurts consumerism and the overall success of the economy. 

Not only that, but the government not only increases corporate taxes, but now they also increase personal income taxes, taxes on various products, and now these businesses are forced to increase prices to sustain themselves/still make a profit and then the public buys less and less because of the harsher tax rate mixed with the increase in prices. 

So what does the government do? The solution is to keep increasing taxes and printing money to solve the problem when in reality the solution itself is causing the problem. 

Its ironic how the government causes the problem, and then both government and media cast the blame on corporations to divert attention so that the government can continue doing what they do without accountability or restraint.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qosprn/why_do_people_hate_the_richcorporations/

1,"11/08/2021, 00:57:45",GME or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Algo,killmeandeatme,"# Intro

Okay  fellow degenerates, my nose is three crayons deep and its time you all  get educated about the only thing that matters in the world of finance,  graph functions. Naked shorts, synthetic CDOs, shorted ETF baskets; all  of it is just fancy words for fucking with the graph. So how do they  fuck the graph, how have they been fucking GME, and how did they get  fucked so bad by GME? Strap in, lube up, were going deep.

# Assumptions

Couple of assumptions were gonna run through, get ready stuffs about to get nutty.

&gt;A single function is responsible for the output, of which, every price graph in all speculative markets is made of.

None  of this Bollinger bands, Elliot waves, Fibonacci numbers. Theyre all  gesturing to the actual function, but theyre like trying to guess  someones eye color from their shoe size. It is one single function  running since time immemorial and it applies to every asset. Currency, stocks, pokemon cards, housing, everything.

&gt;The function is cyclical.

The  function runs repeatedly, with no gaps or bridging patterns. Its first  and last stage of the cycle directly feed into each other, and it  continues for as long as the asset is tradable.

&gt;The function is graphable and deterministic.

The  function always produces the same kinds of graphs without question or  exception. And the pattern of the function is (mostly) deterministic.  Occasionally rare outside events that couldnt be predicted, like the  planet of the apes finding a working Bloomberg terminal, affect the size  or length of the graph, but the basic shape and cyclical nature doesnt  change.

&gt;The hedgefunds are aware of it, have influence but not control of it, and plan all actions with it in mind.

Your  Monday coin surge, the post earnings slump, the fuckery weve all  come to grow and love is all a result of hedgefund influence via the  financial and criminal mechanisms available to them. But they cant  directly control the graph, otherwise we wouldnt still be here to drink  salty hedgie tears when MOASS, only influence it.

&gt;The market is always in equilibrium due to massive amounts of liquidity and sub second high frequency trading

As  sacrilege as it sounds, the price is always right. On assets with low  liquidity infrequently traded, the shape of the graph is less clear, but  the speculative assets hedgies wine and dine in have such massive  liquidity, and volume of activity, the shape of the graph is clearly  defined. Picture a square. As you add more and more sides, such that  theyre all equal length, the shape becomes more round. As you approach  infinite sides, the square becomes a circle.

Now that we have that out of the way, lets dig in.

# The 9 Steps

[The Build Up](https://preview.redd.it/y8kk113jd7y71.jpg?width=1467&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f89b429cac7132288d0ce373c5ed41097956b1d)

We  start with the build up. Hedgies need retails money, so how do they  get it? We take our asset and we slowly increase the price up to a high,  then once we have bagholders, we have the price sink to the original  level, occasionally lower, so that retail cut their losses and Wall  street pockets the difference. Once weve reached max loss cutting  without there being panic sells, we start to rebound and build up some  fast momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Climax](https://preview.redd.it/dfi9etmkd7y71.jpg?width=1552&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=398c04157e7d460cabfdf7864f5a88ffc34b9c12)

I  love this guy! You got your January sneeze, your crytomoon shots, your  current day inflation rates. Number go up, and fast. Stock go eeeeeeee.  We get some nice spike ups, with small pockets of profit taking and stop  loss hunting before we peak and climax.

[Post-nut Clarity](https://preview.redd.it/uqrnp35md7y71.jpg?width=1521&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcba2144b2eea3df69bbc6584dab05992886a3b1)

After  we climax the price comes to its senses, it cant possibly go this high  or higher, and falls right down into a nice bull trap. People panic  sell, right into the next spike up because this is only the next leg of  the moon shot right?! This right here is where bulls hopes and dreams  are trapped and left to die.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Beer Goggles, they do nothing](https://preview.redd.it/vjiwmoxod7y71.jpg?width=1273&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6eb891e63f50535b26488145add2524d4449f7a)

Look,  weve all had that sobering morning after bringing home some cute  asset with a dog in it, next thing you know youre on the wrong side of  a crash of a massive market cap asset with no utility or long term  prospects. This were we reach peak profit realisation from the Hedgies  and crash the price into the earth, retail be damned.

[The Rebound; Is it too late to love again?](https://preview.redd.it/gix2f8wpd7y71.jpg?width=1973&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74095f46fbebd67912cb75f28d4bc36066712e40)

&amp;#x200B;

But  hey were breaking out of the crash! Slowly and steadily even, maybe  this thing has legs. Maybe we can make it work. I could start a garage  hedge fund and day trade, Ill just sell the car for the initial  capital. She can raise the kids, Im sure mom would love her. What could  go wrong?

[Hopes dashed](https://preview.redd.it/bzhnxvvsd7y71.jpg?width=1477&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa73953c71e9676ea0ff71afe730f81d3df0cb7)

Or  maybe its just a shit stock and the time has passed, we slide faster  down than we did up into our lowest point of this cycle and shake off  the last of the damn dirty apes holding onto the roller coaster. This  stage repeats an additional time, just in case you didnt learn your  lesson any of the previous times you absolute madlad.

[Log Hits The Spring](https://preview.redd.it/s35kowbud7y71.jpg?width=2195&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32c48a782c5d1c931c1f1d3354b12f014bcafb5c)

Oh  hang on? Whats this? Were rebounding a little off the floor of the  cycle. Cant have a bull trap without a bear trap to counter it now can  you?  This spring is building up the momentum of a log falling on a  trampoline before flying into low orbit. All hands on deck. Hedgies  prepare for profit.

[This shits got nuts](https://preview.redd.it/vl6yvs2wd7y71.jpg?width=2041&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b949bbab7f5f44f890a079238cf88b89121d2de0)

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing  some nice spikes in price up, good solid gains. Just enough to get  retail to fomo back in before they miss the boat, because we all know  whats coming next.

[FLY ME TO THE MOON](https://preview.redd.it/dw4w1s00e7y71.jpg?width=1809&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21f8f58389d184a50c15ab454b19697024d0fd5b)

Shes back baby! MOASS MOON ad infinitum. Heres where we go peak fomo as  repeat the cycle again, and again, until the world burns from the hot  flushed faces of squeaky faced college students experiencing their first  hit of gambling addiction.

Put it all together and what do you got? A highly predictable pattern with  numerous built in opportunities for peak profit taking, followed by  dirty cheap consolidation, ready to go again tomorrow night. Who needs  the philosopher's stone when you can buy gold at fire sale prices, if  you just wait for the next bear trap in the cycle that you know is both  guaranteed, and within a predictable timeframe.

Now  I can hear the comments already, thanks again to copious amounts of  crayon sniffing. This cant possibly account for every graph? What about  the time scales, or all the missed dates, or cycles that have been  proposed and debunked? Im glad you asked imaginary ape I created to ask  me questions to transition me between rants. None of that matters! And  why dont they matter? Simple:

They've begun selling their machines in Virgin Megastores in the UAE, 750 Best Buy locations in the US, and 500 Staples locations in the US.  They have a massive online following of Becky's, with over 1.4 million followers on Instagram, and a huge presence on Facebook, Etsy, and Pinterest.  This is anecdotal, but I've spoken to a few friends who sell on Etsy, and they swear by Cricut.  One of the biggest draws of Critcut is the fact that you can build very successful businesses on their platform, and their ecosystem contains all the pieces needed to make money.  Very attractive to the essential oil selling, Amway believing demographic.  So we have a well-run business with a passionate user base that has seen very solid growth over the past couple years.  All good reasons to invest, but here is the interesting part.

It has 208 million shares outstanding, but the public float is ONLY 20.8 million.  For comparison, UPST has a public float of 54 million.  I chose UPST for comparison because of the 150%+ runs it went on after its earnings.  I'm not saying CRCT will do something similar, but I think it is possible, and here's why.

Ortex has the short interest at 22.41%, with 4.65 million shares of the 20 million share float loaned out.  Not astronomical, but pretty high.    A significant spike in buying as a result of stellar earnings could catch those shorts with their dicks in their hands, and send CRCT skyrocketing as they try to scramble for shares to stop the bleeding.  And remember, there aren't many shares to be had, because 99.5% of the shares outstanding are locked up with institutions.

Here are the major holders.  Some big names for sure, but its the top one that I want to point out.  Abdiel capital is a hedge fund run by Colin Moran and Geoff Gentile.  They are both Ivy League educated, and worked for Goldman and Barclays respectively before starting Abdiel.  Much smarter than me, and their fund manages over 5 billion in assets.  Over the past couple months, they have been buying CRCT at a super aggressive pace.

Every B on that graph is a large buy order from Abdiel.  They now own 600 million dollars worth of stock.  I'm also assuming that they have bought more since mid-September, and it hasn't been reported yet.

The stock tanked after its earnings on August 12, even after beating big on both EPS and revenue. The CFO cautioned that Q3 would not be as good and did not offer guidance, citing that people are staying home less from the economy reopening.  Wall Street fucking hates when companies don't offer guidance because it means uncertainty, so it sold off.  The EPS estimate for Q3 is 0.16, which is well below its reported number of 0.22 on August 12.  Additionally, revenue is expected to be at 256 million, well below the 334 million reported for Q2.  The bar is set low....

One thing I want to point out is on August 13, the day of the 25% sell off, Abdiel made their largest purchase to date of 1.5 million shares.  Over the course of the next week, they bought about an additional 1 million+ shares, clearly indicating their conviction in their play.

I don't have a position in CRCT yet as I've been researching this for the past couple days.  I'm currently in DIS and AMC calls.  I'll decide what to do tomorrow based on how everything is looking, but I'll definitely begin scaling in.  The spreads are a bit wide on way OTM options, but tighten up the closer you get to the money.  I'm probably going to do 40-50% shares, 30% close to the money Dec calls, and 20% lotto $50 Dec calls.  If you're a gambler, I think Nov $35 calls are the way to go.  Best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qos4o3/crct_earnings_wednesday_possible_squeeze/

TL;DR. Elon has 14.8 billion dollars of tax due when he exercises his options (which he has to do before August 20th, 2022), he can significantly reduce the tax bill by billions of dollars by dropping the Tesla stock price. Selling 10% of his shares covers all of his taxes and leaves him roughly a billion dollars in cash to play with.  Basically, he's using Twitter to lower his taxes.

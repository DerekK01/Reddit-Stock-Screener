1,"11/29/2021, 23:54:45",ARQQW - what is going on here?,Acceptable-Win-1700,"ARQQ sells a quantum encryption service.  Tech looks promising, gov't contracts look promising, I like the stock.  But lets talk about the warrants.  Looks like a huge opportunity.

ARQQ has an insanely small float.  275k float with 120M shares outstanding, 56.9% held by insiders.  Lockup agreement suggests no insider selling until April 2022.

Common (ARQQ) is trading at $37.29 right now.
Warrants (ARQQW) is trading at $8.51 right now.

Here is the warrant agreement:
https://docoh.com/filing/1859690/0001104659-21-073788/ARQQ-F4/file/4

Warrants become excercisable Feb 8, 2022.  Excercise price is $11.50.  Warrant agreement and the huge number of insider shares seems to suggest management will force cashless redemption on day 1 to avoid too much dilution until lockup expires.  Cashless remeption rate is 0.361 with common above $18.  

With common at $35, quick math says these warrants SHOULD be closer to $12.64 if you assume cashless redemption, $23.5 if you assume excercise.  With warrants at $8.5, common would have to drop from 33% to $23.55 by February to NOT profit from holding warrants.  Not only that, but with buy-ins at today's prices, you get over 2x leverage to the upside.

Compare to to April 14, 2022 $22.50 Call at $13.90.

I cannot figure out why these warrants are so cheap, even with a nuetral outlook on ARQQ.  When comparing IONQ-WT, using the same analysis on a stock in the exact same industry with an almost identical warrant agreement, those warrants appear to be priced almost perfectly based on common shares.  Either I am stupid and don't understand something very important here, or this is a great opportunity simply from the risk profile alone.

The company's COVID-19 shot contains an actual version of the virus' spike protein that cannot cause disease but can trigger the immune system. The vaccine developer said it had started developing a spike protein specifically based on the known genetic sequence of the variant, B.1.1.529.

""The initial work will take a few weeks,"" a company spokesperson said. Shares of the company closed up nearly 9% on Friday.

Novavax's vaccine received its first emergency use approval earlier this month in Indonesia followed by the Philippines.

The company has said it is on track to file for U.S. approval by the end of the year. It has also filed for approvals with the European Medicines Agency as well as in Canada.

Other vaccine developers, including Germany's BioNTech SE and Johnson &amp; Johnson, have said they are testing the effectiveness of their shots against the new variant, which is named Omicron by the World Health Organisation.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc said it had begun testing its vaccine candidate, INO-4800, to evaluate its effectiveness against the new variant. The company expects the testing to take about two weeks.

Inovio also said it was simultaneously designing a new vaccine candidate that specifically targeted Omicron.

""Best case scenario, INO-4800 ... will be completely resilient against omicron, but if that's not the case then we will have a newly designed vaccine ready to go if need be,"" said Kate Broderick, senior vice president of Inovio's R&amp;D division.

1,"11/29/2021, 20:16:43",Market Is Competely Wrong On Tilray (TLRY); At Least 30% Upside With German Cannabis Legalization,one32th,"Those who've been following the cannabis industry, knows that Tilrays recent trading performances have been underwhelming. In my opinion, I think the biggest hurdle to the companys share price performance is due to industry-wide low growth along with covid-related consumer &amp; retail headwinds. For example, while Tilray generated 26% top line growth from $405 million in 2020 to $513 million in 2021, much of that topline growth derives from acquisitions; in other words, revenues were bought instead of generated organically with the market expansion. Low growth in recent years along with some structural and covid related challenges have further impacted industrys outlook and profitability, resulting in depressing trading performances.

As cannabis remains illegal at the U.S. federal and debt issuances are off the table, the Canadian cannabis LPs relies on equity issuance to fund acquisition opportunities to grow their toplines. As a result of both stagnant growth and share dilution, Tilray has traded down from $40 in February to $10 last close. Tilrays EV/Sales TTM has also declined to 40x to 10x. For a growth company within a quickly expanding industry thats 3 years old, 10x TTM sales enterprise value is a good price in my opinion. What you should know however is that theres a catalyst that the market has completely dismissed that will derail the stagnant growth narrative.

Germanys new coalition government has reached a deal thats set to legalize recreational Those who've been following the cannabis industry, knows that Tilray's recent trading performance has been underwhelming. In my opinion, the biggest hurdle to the company's trading performance is due to the Canadian adult recreational industry wide challenge along with covid-related retail headwinds. There's been struggles for the Canadian cannabis LPs to generate growth organically within the adult recreational segment. For example, while Tilray, market leader in Canadian adult recreational, generated 26% topline growth from $405 million in 2020 to $513 million in 2021, much of that topline growth is derived from acquisitions. In other words, Tilray's recent revenue growth were ""bought"" instead of generated organically as the market expands. Low growth within the segment along with some structural challenges and covid-related shut-downs further negatively impacted the industry's outlook and profitability, resulting in depressing trading performances. As cannabis companies remain illegal in the United States at a federal level and debt capital raising are off the table as a result, Canadian cannabis LPs relies on equity issuance to fund acquisition opportunities to ""grow"" their toplines. Result of both stagnant growth and share dilution, Tilray traded down from $40 in February 2021 to $10 last close. Tilray's TTM EV/Sales declined from 40x to 10x. For a growth company within a quickly expanding market that's only 3 years old, 10x TTM sales EV is a good price in my opinion. What makes it even more attractive is that there's a catalyst that the market has dismissed and forgotten that will completely derail the stagnant market growth narrative for Tilray. Germany's new coalition government has recently reached a deal that's set to legalize recreational cannabis use. As a result, German pot stocks popped last week on Frankfurt exchange. For example, German cannabis company Synbiotic rose by 33% to $29 Euro, which implies a $100mm market cap. What the market has forgotten however is that Canadian cannabis LP Tilray is actually the market leader in the Germany's cannabis market. But the stock didn't move last week. How do I know the market made a mistake instead of ""everything has been priced in"" narrative? Easy. First, almost every German pot companies moved up last week. The fact that Tilray didn't change at all suggests that whoever was making market genuinely forgot that Tilray is a market leader in the German cannabis market. Second, if we assume status quo on Tilray's 10x EV/Sales multiple, which is a very conservative assumption because we're completely dismissing the potential of a new, 3-days old, 83 million population addressable market. And if we proxy $90 million of additional revenue, which is another very conservative assumption as Tilray generated $90 million in revenue after Canada legalized their adult recreational cannabis market in 2018; Conservative because German population doubles of Canadian. With the conservative multiple assumption while holding other variables constant, just by adding the additional $90 million in revenue, we should expect Tilray trade up by at least 30%. The fact that it didn't trade up at the slightest suggests whoever was making market was sleeping in his office after he had his turkey. Third, Tilray is production and distribution ready. Tilray operates two state-of-art facilities in Portugal and Germany with over 3 million square feet of production capacity. Tilray also owns and operates one of the largest market cap pharmaceutical company, CC Pharma, in Germany. Because of the company's production and distribution capacity, institutional support, larger balance sheet, domestic moms &amp; pops cannabis producers in Germany aren't like to able to compete against Tilray in the immediate 24 months of legalization, allowing Tilray to secure market leadership. Again, this echoes with why assume only $90 million of revenue and 10x EV/Sales is a very conservative estimate. Forth, there has been consistencies showing that the cannabis MTM is very inefficient. Most of you are aware that there were a squeeze with the Canadian cannabis LPs that took place in February. It was driven by Democrats winning the election, investors bet in favour that recreational cannabis use will be legalized in the U.S. It was similar to what's happening today; similar but different. What's similar is that both are political driven catalyst and market has gotten it completely wrong. Different was that last time Tilray were traded up for the wrong reason, Tilray has minimal operations in the United States, while they're already a market leader in the German cannabis market with operations and infrastructures that are unmatched by their competitors.

 The [NIO](https://carnewschina.com/tag/nio/) ET7 is finally for real. The production version was unveiled on the eve of the 2021 Guangzhou Auto Show in China. NIO also announced pricing and colors.  

&amp;#x200B;

1.  **Do you like the  ET7 car ?** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnpxgqezqi281.jpg?width=1068&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2aee4d2eebda657bef880cdfe9d5db2f6c9e762

**For me it looks like a modern Maserati   Lol.**

&amp;#x200B;

 NIO still doesnt have its own factory. Like the other NIOs, the NIO ET7 is contract-manufactured by Jianghuai Automobile (JAC). NIOs [current contract](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-announces-renewal-joint-manufacturing) with JAC runs until 2024. In the mean time, NIO hopes to build its own factory, but recently we havent heard much about that anymore, so perhaps they plan to stay with JAC for a bit longer. 

NIO sees first Pre-Production vehicles of ET7 roll off line.  The core objective of this phase is to make the production line capable of mass production, at the end of which the ET7 will officially enter the final mass production phase. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

https://preview.redd.it/w1hgf0ydri281.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=253214e76b440f36700836e09f3decbf1eb44b79

NIO announced the progress on its app today, saying that the rollout of the Pre-Production vehicles means that the production line is beginning to validate the vehicle's small-volume production capacity and ensure that all parts are in marketable condition. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Nio backed EV startup Hycan launched the Z03 crossover for $20,000** 

&amp;#x200B;

Hycan is a new EV brand in China. It was [founded in 2018](https://www.facebook.com/carnewschina/posts/new-car-brand-from-china-hycanhycan-is-yet-another-new-ev-brand-from-china-it-is/2486228844743129/) as a joint venture between state-owned GAC (Guangzhou Auto) and [Nio](https://carnewschina.com/2021/07/18/automaker-profile-history-of-nio/). While Nios cars are built by another state-owned automaker JAC, GAC will take care of the manufacturing of Hycan vehicles. Z03 is Hycans second car (the first was SUV Hycan 007, which had moderate success). In the first half of this year, GAC NIO JV was renamed Hycan Automobile Technology Co., Ltd. Hycan automobile focuses on young users. 

 This week, Hycan Z03 was officially announced on the market. There are four trims, with a price range of 132,800 yuan to 168,800 yuan ($20,000  $26,000).

&amp;#x200B;

Hycan z03 Cool play version and Cool smart version are equipped with drive motors with a maximum power of 135kW and peak torque of 225Nm. The high-performance Version (Z Cool version) is equipped with drive motors with the full power of 160kW and a peak torque of 225Nm. In terms of range, it will provide two battery packs with different capacities, 64.6kwh and 76.8kWh. NEDC also has two options: 500km and 600km.

The number of offline stores of Hycan automobile has reached 107, covering 66 cities in China.

**2. How many of you knew that NIO is playing lower premium EV market ?** 

**3. Do you like this strategy they are adopting ?**

**4. What is your opinion on the Z03 car ?**

The basic idea is that it's  trading at a massive discount in the $32 range even though book value is  calculated over $90/share even though it's not going bankrupt or  bleeding cash as of its latest earnings.

The pics below are from one of the DD threads that show how much of a  discount it's trading at compared to its peers, although Jackson doesn't have a 12% div yield (looks like that was an estimate before they  actually introduced the dividend).

I know what I did wrong was continue on Margin knowing this was extremely risky, instead of investing the extra 1k I got from working full time as a security guard, I burnt it all on necessities and the weed dispensary. That 1k would have saved my ass.

It ipod roughly a year ago at like $24 and has been on a downward trajectory since. But even if it is a crappy company with a crappy product, arent stocks like that historically celebrated in this sub? I always thought the spirit of the sub was based on outrageous wagers on either unrealistic expectations of good stocks, or betting huge on shitty stocks. 

Any mention of WISH is absolutely tarred and feathered here now. Why is this? There are certainly shittier companies and stocks out there that dont get the backlash that WISH does. Im really just curious about how it became hated to the extent it is here, when a stock like it should fit right in the spirit of the sub.

Hear me out, 

BB has rapidly changed and grown its business and making very possible gains and changes until their pie is eaten once again by apple.

AMC, yeah massive dilution which has held me off this one but their business has recovered, there are lots of very interesting claims by shareholders, and yeah they are making adoptions to payment flow that will continue their recovery.

GameStonk, is this not the best in breed, paid their debt off without any real dilution, price is holding way up where it was. While I am optimistic they announce something transformational even if they do not, still a big player in a big sector?

There are a handful of others like PLtR that has valuation growing into to prove but if your time horizon is long enough then it is a steal at these prices. 

Then there is Nio, which I have heard called a meme stonk, but is majorly underperformed other meme stocks from the period, yet has the best results and my goodness their growth potential is just sliding up the adoption curve!

My point is these companies are not pump and dumps, garbage being sold with no real opportunity in their space(pltn, any, sdc). They are companies winning in the market growing metrics and with loyal share holder bases and customers.

Meanwhile the Wall Street big boys have companies like Lucid, sNow, pltn, look at Rivian(I love their vehicle but seriously worth half an Intel)
Yet these companies are GtG.

May hate the rant but feel the powers that be and too many with a voice are doing what they always do and creating divides vice welcoming a really talented cohort of investors to the table, to me that is a problem, and a catastrophe for the future.

So although I am no scientist, (and thank God that Im not because I assure you I would do a worse job), it doesnt take one to see that this is not your run of the mill whoopsies. Murder charges insinuate intent. Guess we'l see how it goes. As for me, puts on AstraZeneca. Puts on boomer downdoots.

Micron's mission is to ensure the highest quality of PPE in Canada. 
Their products are certified and recycled at the end of their life. 
This is a good micro cap
opportunity in an industry where demand is still high.
Currently trades at $0.035 CAD and was at a 52 week high of $0.25 CAD, so good value in buying.

This week with the Omicron strain fears and MSM going ham on spreading fud, I am going to focus on some covid stocks as they provide some good opportunities to scalp some nice premium. As the news cycle evolves, and we start hearing that Omicron variant is not as dangerous as we think, it might be time to get out of some of these plays. 

#The goal of this post is to stimulate discussion so that we can all make better trades. If there is something materially wrong with what I present please let me know and I will fix it. If you have other input about these stocks, sound off below so we can all learn.

###Options flow is very bullish. PFE has a much more efficacious covid pill than MRK, to the point that they have submitted applications for EUA to FDA, and stopped recruiting new patients (very good sign, because that means that the ethical cost of putting people on placebo is too high). As you all know I have 200x 55c's for 12/17 (thanks gain /u/literallyfromhell). I am gonna keep holding these.

###Options flow leans bullish. But I have puts on MRK (77.5p 12/3 shoutout again to /u/literallyfromhell), they self-reported that their covid pill efficacy is lower than what they expected. Their EUA hearing is on Tuesday and I expect it to be denied. In my mind this is a complimentary play to PFE, as their pill is so good that it will be in conversation with MRK covid pill is discussed.

1.	 Filter by daily losers, start at the worst and go through anything that has lost at least 20%. NO pharmaceuticals.
2.	review 52 week history which must be at least 40% higher than current, and any technicalities as to why it dipped so hard. If there is no solid reason or the reason is clearly temporary then consider the buy.
3.	review volume for normal behavior as an indication of where it will return. Must have good volume normally before current sell off.
4.	always sell at 20% unless there is a clear run up and correction on the stock. Or sell earlier if it is lingering with at least a positive return.

This leads to consistent returns usually within a week or two on the stock in question.

Im not saying this is good, nor that you should do it. Just that it works for me. Period. Do not do this.

And this was industry wide, different banks all relying on the infallibility of their new way of combining mortgages to ""reduce"" risk, which would have maybe worked if they had not leveraged their way into a corner, which equates to confidently applying their new methods in ways that have not really be studied or examined - they were ignorant to how this would effect the usage of CDOs.

More abstractly speaking, people had developed a new way of doing something that seemed much better, and after it worked for a little while to show proof of concept, people bought in to the method (in this case CDOs and their supporting ideas) full force and they utilized it confidently.

Because now the mortgage industry had this new magical tool, the new-found efficiency of doing business pushed lenders to be more aggressive, accepting more risk, and leveraging their new ace-in-the hole techniques until they hit a point that IF the new way of doing business failed, the entire operation would be at risk (all eggs in this proverbial basket). And this was industry wide, different banks all relying on the infallibility of their new way of combining mortgages to ""reduce"" risk, which would have maybe worked if they had not leveraged their way into a corner, which equates to confidently applying their new methods in ways that have not really be studied or examined - they were ignorant to how this would effect the usage of CDOs.

Do you reeeeally need to travel to another country or continent? Here, board this cool-looking retro thing, and you'll get there in 2-3 weeks.

If someone brings covid aboard, then by the time the dirigible docks, that'll be pretty damn apparent. If the whole flight is clear, they're good to depart and embrace the terra firma once more.

Also, that's way better for the environment than plane travel, which frankly gets a little ridiculous these days. (No, your toddler will not appreciate the beauty of Europe.

1,"11/29/2021, 01:10:24","TSM DD: The Most Important, Worst Performing Semiconductor (besides Intel)",SpongebobSoundByte,"**Company Summary**

TSMC is the worlds largest semiconductor manufacturer, with total market share at 57%, and high-performance market share of  &gt;70%. They are based in Taiwan, but have recently started construction of new fabs in Arizona and Japan. They supply chips for Apple, AMD, NVDA, INTC. 

**Opportunity**

*Large Addressable Market, and Growing*

The semiconductor space is currently a $550B industry, with total market growth of almost 25% YoY. This kind of growth rate for a mature industry is incredible, but semiconductors have a cyclical nature. Total semiconductor share is expected to grow to $800B by 2028, a CAGR of almost 10%. 

*Strong Macro Tailwind*

Possible semiconductor legislation, and moves to green energy store, production,and EVs require semiconductors

*Possible semiconductor supercycle*

The age of the Metaverse, AI, 5G, EVs, self-driving, and robotics are upon us. These industries are growing at rapid pace and require custom chips, with TSMC provides. AMD/NVDA have skyrocketed this year on Metaverse news/great earnings, and TSMC is the main supplier of these high performance chips. The reason Micron bounced back recently is because people are realizing this cycle will last longer than they thought. AMD CEO Lisa Su (I love her) recently stated we are in a semiconductor megacycle. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGwLas0MyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGwLas0MyY)

**Strengths**

*Strong Financials*

TSMC is sitting on a PE of 29, and a forward PE of 25. They are currently growing at a CAGR of about 15%, with their gross margin at about 50%, which I suspect will be growing in the coming quarters. TSMC recently raised prices across the board 10-20%, which all their customers accepted. They know they have pricing power, as they sell literally everything they make. Companies fight over capacity. I have a feeling we may see more price increases in the future as their moat widens. They also pay a nice dividend. 

*Amazing Products, Wide Moat*

TSMCs moat is widening every year. Frankly, Intel is fucked. They are 1-2 years behind on nodes, and this gap is growing. TSMC will spend more than 100 billion dollars in just the next 3 years on fabs, which they have plans for 3 new fabs this year. TSMC is starting mass production on 5nm nodes, while Intel is on 10nm (about 7nm compared to TSMC). Once you lose the performance crown, it's very difficult to take it back. In fact, Intel started to buy chips from TSMC this year. 

**Risks**

*Gyna.* Over 50% of their capacity in based on Taiwan. If China decides to attack, they are fucked. 

HOWEVER, tell me. If China attacks Taiwan, what do you think will happen to your stocks? The entire market will take a shit. It will be WW3. So while these are valid concerns, the chances of an invasion are very low, and if they do, money is gonna be the least of my problems. Anyways. 

**The Play**

TSM is currently up 20% over the last year (YTD 4%), underperforming the market, with semiconductor ETFs up over 45% in the same period. Theyve traded in a range of 110-125 since February.

1,"11/29/2021, 01:08:07","TSM DD: The Most Important, Worst Performing Semiconductor (besides Intel)",SpongebobSoundByte,"&amp;#x200B;

**Company Summary**

TSMC is the worlds largest semiconductor manufacturer, with total market share at 57%, and high-performance market share of  &gt;70%. They are based in Taiwan, but have recently started construction of new fabs in Arizona and Japan. They supply chips for Apple, AMD, NVDA, INTC. 

**Opportunity**

*Large Addressable Market, and Growing*

The semiconductor space is currently a $550B industry, with total market growth of almost 25% YoY. This kind of growth rate for a mature industry is incredible, but semiconductors have a cyclical nature. Total semiconductor share is expected to grow to $800B by 2028, a CAGR of almost 10%. 

*Strong Macro Tailwind*

Possible semiconductor legislation, and moves to green energy store, production,and EVs require semiconductors

*Possible semiconductor supercycle*

The age of the Metaverse, AI, 5G, EVs, self-driving, and robotics are upon us. These industries are growing at rapid pace and require custom chips, with TSMC provides. AMD/NVDA have skyrocketed this year on Metaverse news/great earnings, and TSMC is the main supplier of these high performance chips. The reason Micron bounced back recently is because people are realizing this cycle will last longer than they thought. AMD CEO Lisa Su (I love her) recently stated we are in a semiconductor megacycle. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGwLas0MyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGwLas0MyY)

**Strengths**

*Strong Financials*

TSMC is sitting on a PE of 29, and a forward PE of 25. They are currently growing at a CAGR of about 15%, with their gross margin at about 50%, which I suspect will be growing in the coming quarters. TSMC recently raised prices across the board 10-20%, which all their customers accepted. They know they have pricing power, as they sell literally everything they make. Companies fight over capacity. I have a feeling we may see more price increases in the future as their moat widens. They also pay a nice dividend. 

*Amazing Products, Wide Moat*

TSMCs moat is widening every year. Frankly, Intel is fucked. They are 1-2 years behind on nodes, and this gap is growing. TSMC will spend more than 100 billion dollars in just the next 3 years on fabs, which they have plans for 3 new fabs this year. TSMC is starting mass production on 5nm nodes, while Intel is on 10nm (about 7nm compared to TSMC). Once you lose the performance crown, it's very difficult to take it back. In fact, Intel started to buy chips from TSMC this year. 

**Risks**

*Gyna.* Over 50% of their capacity in based on Taiwan. If China decides to attack, they are fucked. 

HOWEVER, tell me. If China attacks Taiwan, what do you think will happen to your stocks? The entire market will take a shit. It will be WW3. So while these are valid concerns, the chances of an invasion are very low, and if they do, money is gonna be the least of my problems. Anyways. 

**The Play**

TSM is currently up 20% over the last year (YTD 4%), underperforming the market, with semiconductor ETFs up over 45% in the same period. Theyve traded in a range of 110-125 since February. Last week, they broke above 125 before the market took a fat shit. Options volume has been crazy and IV is on the rise, whales buying up tons of December calls.

* **India's RuPay dominates number of issued cards**
* **Prime Minister Modi, other officials promote use of RuPay**
* **Visa told U.S. govt Modi's linked RuPay use to national service**

&amp;#x200B;

Visa Inc [**(V.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/V.N) has complained to the U.S. government that India's ""informal and formal"" promotion of domestic payments rival RuPay hurts the U.S. giant in a key market, memos seen by Reuters show.

In public Visa has downplayed concerns about the rise of RuPay, which has been supported by public lobbying from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that has included likening the use of local cards to national service.

But U.S. government memos show Visa raised concerns about a ""level playing field"" in India during an Aug. 9 meeting between U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai and company executives, including CEO Alfred Kelly.

Mastercard Inc [**(MA.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MA.N) has raised similar concerns privately with the USTR. Reuters reported in 2018 that the company had lodged a [**protest**](https://reut.rs/3cQA2La) with the USTR that Modi was using nationalism to promote the local network.

""Visa remains concerned about India's informal and formal policies that appear to favour the business of National Payments Corporation of India"" (NPCI), the non-profit that runs RuPay, ""over other domestic and foreign electronic payments companies,"" said a USTR memo prepared for Tai ahead of the meeting.

Visa told the U.S. government it was concerned India's ""push to use transit cards linked to RuPay"" and ""the not so subtle pressure on banks to issue"" RuPay cards, the USTR email showed.

Mastercard and Visa count India as a key growth market, but have been jolted by a 2018 central bank directive for them to store payments data ""only in India"" for ""unfettered supervisory access"".

Mastercard faces an indefinite ban on issuing new cards in India after the central bank said it was not complying with the 2018 rules. A USTR official privately called the Mastercard ban ""draconian"", Reuters reported in September.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r489dl/visa_complains_to_us_govt_about_india_backing_for/

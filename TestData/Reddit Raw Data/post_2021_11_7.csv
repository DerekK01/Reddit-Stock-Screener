1,"11/07/2021, 23:16:28",The reason Elon is selling $TSLA shares is to save tax; plain and simple:,MountainNearby4027,"The latest democratic plan is involves an 8% rate surcharge (on top of the top marginal rate of 35%) for those making greater than $25 million plus an additional 3.8% surtax on net investment income. If my understanding is correct (careful, cause my mommy says Im special), the gross proceeds of the sale would be taxed at around ~46% for Federal plus State &amp; Local. Hell save a shit ton of cash tax (around $2billion) by selling in 2021 (before enactment) and you know what? 

The punch line:   Hell probably buy it back (at a lower price) and have full tax basis in the stock so if he ever wants to sell it in the future, there will be significantly less taxable gains.  

Additional ideas:

It seems like a perfect storm of $TSLA being at an all time high and the Democrats seemingly closer to being able to push through a tax increase.  

Elons Twitter pole also may change the conversationi.e., wouldnt be surprised if the policy shifts more toward taxing unrealized gains, which would suck.

TWNK has also previously noted that their supply chain has allowed them to get products on store shelves and that they have been passing along some of their costs to retail. The company has been trying to shore up it's balance sheet and pay down debt, so a steady stream of product, lower costs, and better-than-expected revenue hint that they may have another very positive ER.

Additionally, [I noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qbksck/digging_deeper_into_twnk/) some oddities with the institutional ownership of TWNK that indicated the SI could be much, much higher than is being currently reported (possibly &gt;100% of the float) with, as /u/pennyether notes, the vast majority of the shorts having taken positions in the &lt;$15 range.

Finally, the upcoming Nov 19 OPEX is tilted absurdly to the call-side, giving very positive sentiment, and the IV is still only at 67% so options are still pretty cheap.

1,"11/07/2021, 22:51:42",Why I think CLF is free money this week,rigatoni-man,"First, the TLDR in visual form:

[Loureno Goncalves, CEO of Cleveland Cliffs, and Steelmaker of the Year](https://preview.redd.it/yrt9v78pq6y71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d0c4a26ce94461babe9242f82ec147c8caffee)

Now, for those of you that can read, here's why I am dumping a bunch of money in CLF this week.

# 1. CLF's share price is nearly what it was before earnings, and looks ripe for a bounce.

https://preview.redd.it/jjnn4jm9p6y71.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0013e7fcea75c19c010e53d833161bebf850ee69

# 2. CLF is coming off of a fantastic earnings call, which rocketed the share price to 26.50 on October 26th.

The highlights were:

* **Record earnings**  
"" We reported another quarter of record revenues of $6 billion, record net income of $1.3 billion and record adjusted EBITDA of over $1.9 billion, ahead of the guidance we recently set of $1.8 billion.""
* **Sunny outlook for next year**, they expect to earn even more than this year.  This is not based on optimism, it's based on the fact that they've already locked contracts in.  
""Wrapping up, the financial position of the company is on stronger footing today than it has been during my entire time here at Cliffs and the trend should continue into Q4 and 2022. The fixed price contract business we have with high-end clients, such as the automotive OEMs, gives us significant downside protection if spot prices trend lower. Therefore, even under the current bearish futures curve for HRC, our average selling price should be much higher next year than it has been this year, leading to the expectation of another year of outstanding EBITDA, cash flow generation and debt reduction in 2022. ""

# 3. The Infrastructure Bill just passed

Of course you know this.  So does everyone else.  Nobody has had a chance to buy since the news.  What more I can I say?  Any doubts that America is going to stop needing steel in the next few years should now be gone.  If we're lucky, papa Joe will sign it during market hours.  


I will be paying attention to HRC futures next week to see how they react: [https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-contracts](https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-contracts)

# 4. Section 232 Tariffs finally addressed, no more looming black cloud.

After a long period of uncertainty about what would happen to the tariffs that were protecting American steel, an agreement was finally reached.  The US will let in a minuscule amount of steel from Europe tax free.  It's great to have this cloud lifted, and shouldn't make a huge difference on steel in the US.  Don't take it from me though, take it from Loureno Goncalves, CEO of Cleveland Cliffs.  


Todays announcement of an alternative Section 232 measure with the EU is evidence that President Biden and his Administration understand the critical role of the steel Section 232 program in providing a level playing field for American companies and workers. This tariff rate quota arrangement will guard against a harmful surge of steel imports from the EU.

The agreement recognizes that the United States has the most environmentally friendly steel industry in the world. Cleveland-Cliffs produces high-quality flat-rolled steel products with all stages of production occurring in the United States, from the mining of key raw materials through melting and finishing. In furtherance of Cleveland-Cliffs commitment to decarbonization, the Company has spent more than $1 billion since 2017 to build the worlds most technologically-advanced direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. This plant produces hot briquetted iron that is 70% less CO2 intensive than imported metallics such as pig iron.

I wish to thank Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai, for negotiating a deal that respects the importance of maintaining strong Section 232 measures to the benefit of U.S. national and economic security.

# What are my positions?

This is WSB, so I am holding &gt;1000 weeklies between 23 and 25.5 that I bought on Friday and prayed infrastructure would pass.  Nancy came through! Plus some longer dated calls that I've been swinging for a while.

I'm planning to buy $40k worth of shares in my 401k Monday morning.

Whether those factors result in a significant pullback after earnings remains to be seen, but the tax provision recent infrastructure bill is very interesting and will likely be discussed on the conference call.  For those that don't know, the bill is requiring all digital asset transactions over $10,000 to be reported to the IRS.  The recipient has to verify the sender's personal information and social security number within 15 days, or it is fucking FELONY.  That is huge, and could lead to massive issues further down the road as there will undoubtedly be confusion and plenty of mistakes made.

Since this spectacular fall it has also experienced a very large rise, however, I think it can still go up by a lot, because:
- Many people were left with the idea that it could not be sold on Pancake Swap if they did not have Marbles, although it is perfectly possible to convert from SQUID to WBNB without problem. As more people know this and lose the fear of losing all the funds again (which indeed may be perfectly possible), the demand will increase.
- The max supply (which in principle is the current supply, except for the burn of 80M) of 800M is not that high either for the amount of hype created around the Squid Game series and the publicity that has been given to the scam perpetrated by the creators of the token.
- Being a minority token and currently quite avoided due to its recent history, it could happen that a relatively small amount of demand drains the liquidity pools and the AMMs end up setting an exorbitant price.

For all of the above, I have bet $800 that it skyrockets. Of course, you have to be very vigilant and know when to sell. I expect some correction still, since today it has lost almost 50% compared to yesterday. However I think that over the next month it may be a good bet.

This is lining up to be a perfect technical, fundamental and crazy Elon tweet storm of bearishness for $ARKK.

Looking at the chart $ARKK has not joined in the most recent 'everything rally'. It's not near new highs and is at some technical resistance.

It's largest holding is $TSLA which has been on a screamer and to me looks blow off toppy. It's a great stock but it's extension, along with Elon's tweets over the weekend, as well as his options expiring soon IMO gives it at least a chance to pullback in the short term.

Now comes the kicker, despite it's largest holding screaming higher $ARKK is still on a downwards trend. The rest of the underlying holdings look like dogshit.

I think the only holdings I sort of like is $COIN (long it) and $U. I believe we saw some liquidations in things like $Z and $PTON this week.

The question is if there is any sort of mean reversion on $TSLA would the selling $ARKK would be forced to do lead to further liquidations in some of it's shittier holdings and ultimately lead to some Bill Huang type shit?

I am taking a stab at this Monday as I think it's a good risk reward. I'll be using options (duh) to structure this trade:

**$ARKK Short Jan 120 Put + 2 x Long Jan 110 Put.**

I believe this a a good way to structure it. If I'm wrong and the teflon doesn't crack the trade is a small credit, if I'm right and it tanks then I obviously make some. Biggest loss would be if it trades sideways rest of the year, e.g maybe $COIN has some fucking blowout earnings and keeps it stable.

Technical analysis indicates that now is an excellent time to buy into HIMX. As shown in the chart below, HIMX is breaking out of a four-month long decline and buying now allows an entry point that comes with low downside risk. Moreover, this break-out is occurring in November, exactly one year from the break-out that occurred last November.  Comparing the two break-outs suggests that strong gains lie ahead for HIMX.

HIMX has a support at $10 that has been tested multiple times this year (see chart). This support first started as a resistance (point 1), which then switched to a support that was subsequently tested six times (points 2-7). In general, the more a support is tested and holds, the stronger it gets. For example, at point 6, the support was breached and HIMX closed below $10. However, the very next trading session HIMX recovered and closed above $10. In subsequent trading sessions the $10  support was tested but not breached (point 7). If a support is breached, but subsequent trading sessions fail to confirm this breach, the support is considered to have held.  The chart shows that the $10 support has held pretty much throughout 2021.

**Downward Channel Broken**

HIMX has been in a downward channel since July 1, forming a descending flag  pattern. However, HIMX broke out of this pattern between Oct. 28 - Nov. 1, which is right where the upper channel line intersects the $10 support. A break-out at this location is not coincidental and very bullish for HIMX, especially given the strong post-earnings follow-through on Nov. 5. In fact, this break-out mirrors the start of the break-out that happened back in November 2020. Again, very bullish.

**Conclusion**

After months of decreasing prices, HIMX has formed a reversal that is turning into a strong break-out. This break-out will especially accelerate if the bears capitulate and close out their short positions. (As of October 15, the short interest is 24,652,040 shares or 14.1% of the public float.) I have already posted about the lure of HIMXs FY-2021 dividend, which will most likely be above $1.92 per share and correspond to a 16+% forward yield. But there is one other thing to consider.  (Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMX/comments/qns9ow/if_you_are_interested_in_himx_now_is_the_time_to/) to read post on dividends.)

The  market is heading into December, a time in which many investors and institutions re-balance their stock portfolios for the next year. Such re-balancing includes investors and institutions reducing their exposure to stocks that performed well but have become overextended.  The resulting profits are rotated into undervalued names. HIMX is deeply undervalued relative to virtually all other semiconductor stocks. For example, AMD and NVDA have forward PE ratios of 41.04 and 63.74,  respectively, while HIMX has a forward PE ratio of about 4.7. As such, HIMX is going to garner a lot of buying interest in December due to its ridiculously low PE, strong projected 2022 revenues, expanding 2022 margins, and mind-boggling 16+% forward yield.

The bottom line here is to get in early before HIMX really starts to move.  If Fridays (Nov. 5) price action is any indication, investors liked  what management had to say during their earnings call (Nov. 4) and more will buy into HIMX as the word starts to spread. The technical analysis shown in the chart below indicates that now is an excellent entry point in HIMX and comes with low downside risk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qoie78/technical_analysis_on_himx_indicates_that_now_is/

It's important to note that the long-term story for SDC is intact and looks very promising, as they turn their business around to avoid these short-term one-off issues. SDC has a vertically-integrated platform and a very unique way of operating that prevents any other competitors from stealing their business. This is crucial to their business and is what will eventually allow them to grow profitably. Also keep in mind the extras they are selling including various dental products.

3) Recent byte acquisition for 1b gives cue:

1,"11/07/2021, 11:58:10",Investor Note - 2022 Summary,austinajs,"Times have certainly changed. In hindsight we underestimated a number of critical factors impacting the financial markets. A perfect storm of global economic shocks has led to a precipitous drop in the worldwide equity markets.

Signals had been growing that a collapse was possible. As inflation began to ravage American purchasing power, people sought to buy more tangible goods as supplies dwindled. Digital assets, especially if thought of as currencies, were known to be poor allocations during rising inflation. People cashed out of cryptocurrencies in favor of actual goods, which began dropping its value dramatically at the end of the year. Meme stocks were next, as retail investors quickly realized that the companies had turned a good deal of their strategy toward digital assets tied to cryptocurrencies. Or that they were stuck hopelessly in the past like the AMC facing the growth of convenience of in-home-streaming. Many finally figured that these companies may not be the best positioned for the future after all. In fact, both GME and AMC were delisted after crushing exodus from their stock. No private suitors emerged as the companies as sophisticated investors were not enthralled in what made out to be venture capital plays at best. These strategies had potentially exciting returns, but were most likely to fall dead before something interesting would come to pass.

The first market wide indication of trouble came as the Fed began its tapering programs. When announced the market was unmoved. However in early December, a small correction was triggered as the 10 year treasury began to rise slightly faster than expected. It was later learned that this caused a large portion of the market trading on automated risk-return algorithms to quickly exchange assets into the fixed income market, causing the first equity leg down.

Problems then compounded around Christmas and the New Year. The holiday season was plagued by ever increasing supply issues. Surging retail demand coupled with an already heavily disrupted supply chain created a number of shortages. Now feeling more of the direct impacts of the supply chain, the American public began to pay closer attention to their leaders. Many Republicans cite hardline policies on vaccine mandates as the final domino in the supply chain disruptions. In truth it had little bearing on the situation, as panic buying had already built a huge bullwhip (Forrester) effect long before the holiday selling season. A strained supply chain began to completely logjam as persistent over purchasing had built so much excess in the system. A tired workforce was unable to keep up with crushing backlogs. Many quit their jobs under the immense pressure to fulfill holiday demand. Even record overtime pay wasnt enough to keep people working in the growing pressure kettle of the large online retailers grueling supply chain. President Bidens approval rating dropped to the lowest in recorded history.

The more significant impact to the market came late January as waves of companies that were unable to fulfill their typical holiday volumes missed earnings estimates substantially. Juxtaposed to record volumes in earlier quarters, firms depleted inventories couldnt keep up with the demand. Most illustrated by Apple Corporation who could only get 85% of its normal holiday volumes to market. Rising supplier costs continued to hollow out bottom lines to add other concerns to the sustainability of record profits seen throughout the pandemic. This added momentum to the market decline, heavily spooking investors who began to pay closer attention to price/earnings ratios.

More bad news followed from inflation readings. As retailer shelves had emptied early from heavy promotion of pre black friday deals. Many had scrambled online in fear of missing out on the most popular holiday items, causing price setting algorithms to rapidly increase prices. As the inflation readings skyrocketed throughout the end of the year and into the new year, the entire Federal Reserve Board had been called in front of congress. The Board was lambasted for the instability in the financial system. Many calls were made to accelerate the tapering process, even as those came at the expense of Washington insiders' massive financial portfolios. Many elected officials had become too scared to sell and be caught in another stock market scandal. Powell was reluctant to heed the calls, but eventually relented. Alarmingly when accelerated, the tapering exposed that other countries had their own growing debt burdens and the American public's diminishing confidence in their government had left demand for US bonds severely overestimated. Additional tapering exposed a severe lack of demand for the notes, driving the 10 year treasury several percentage points higher.

Concern started to rise about corporations' ability to fund debt in a higher interest rate environment. Inflation was seen as the only option as the rate could rise no higher without wrecking havoc on the global financial system. Many companies, over-leveraged by the decade of cheap money, now risked default as a large portion of debt funding was tied to floating rate instruments.

Meanwhile overseas, a cascading impact was starting to be felt when Evergrande and a growing number of other Chinese property developers were unable to repay billion dollar notes due in early 2022. This signaled that most of the bonds of Chinese real estate developers were completely worthless. Evergrandes CEO fled the country in an attempt to avoid the heavy pressure from the Chinese government to use his own diminished wealth to repay the bonds. Additional press reports of the true magnitude of the debt crisis emerged as the defaults uncovered how much debt was hidden off balance sheet for Chinese developers. While believed to be mitigated by Chinas central bank, the magnitude of the problem was underestimated and China faces a significant financial crisis akin to the 2008 financial crisis in the US. Most impacted are those that held debt outside of China, as all focus of the CCP has been to mitigate domestic damage.

Tensions within US-China relationship had grown considerably during this period as China faced its number of nationalistic crises. The Chinese public surprisingly outwardly grew more concerned with Xi leadership as they faced significant losses from property values and homes never completed. In desperation to distract from the problems, signs indicate that he was getting closer to using military conflict to reunify Taiwan, accelerating worries of a new and more complicated full blown cold war. This cold war that would have been far more dangerous with Chinas economic power entwined with the US, unlike previous superpower conflicts of the past. However, an angry Chinese population had overthrown the government before any more dangerous conflict could arise. The US hopes a Democratic government may be formed in its wake, focused on basic human rights and freedoms.

Back in the US, a group of angry Reddit investors confronted Elon Musk after Telsa dropped 95% of its value as states started to step in to regulate Self Driving car technology as a series of high profile mishaps finally forced the regulatory agencies to step in to control the rollouts of these technologies. Those bodies indicated it could be several years before they would have the framework in place to allow for a regulated self driving market. Elon tweeted after the incident: You win some, you lose some Cybertruck still looks really cool

Labor relations problems in the US continued to escalate as employees wanted more control of the companies they work for, ensuring these problems dont happen again. Wage inflation pressures continue despite the market correction, as more workers demand a fairer distribution of compensation from their executives.

Janet Yellen resigned as secretary of the treasury, citing family issues, joining a long list of economic leaders in the administration who resigned over the financial meltdown. Concerns of the stress of the mounting cash flow requirements of the treasury department are speculated as the true reason for her departure.

Banks currently face the difficult decision of how to approach floating rates agreements at current levels as most businesses were over-leveraged and could not support the rapid increases in interest rates. The Libor rate has risen considerably while the Fed has kept the fed fund rate at 0. Congress hastily passed a law limiting interest rates banks can charge on any loans for a two year period to curb a rash of potential defaults as the Fed struggles to reverse policy and regain stabilization by restarting pandemic level bond purchasing programs. However, with the true problem exposed, many wonder if this program will have the same effect it did previously.

There are reports that the drastic price movements in individual shares across the market had been exaggerated by pay for order flow algorithms. It is speculated that the algorithms behind the scheme had prioritized and accelerated volatility which drove more dramatic price movements to drive additional profit for the market makers. As the pay for order flow consolidated due to high retail activity in online brokerages stoked by the pandemic, the competition that would have minimized these effects had been drowned out, allowing only a few algorithms to dedicate stock prices. The SEC has opened a wide ranging investigation into this phenomenon. The largest market makers currently have not responded publicly to the allegations.

All the news is not completely bad for the stock market and the economy. Reasonably priced securities with tangible business models were least impacted by the drawdown, losing only half the value compared with their higher valued peers particularly in the technology space. Companies that also did not rely on an import dominated offshore supply chain escaped the brunt of the pain. Supply chains have begun to ease as record demand has cooled and the shipping industry's new investments began to come online to augment the system.

All in all, if you were highly invested in high-valued growth equities, your portfolios suffered the most. The Great Reset as it is now called has reminded people that the financial markets are driven by real companies with real performance trading on a historically reasonable price to earnings ratios. At current the bond yields now offer a reasonable alternative to equity investing, returning a non-volatile asset class into the financial picture for managing risk. Business leaders are already engaging the community to bring home overextended offshore supply chains that while more costly are far more resilient and friendlier to the environment.

Okay So we all know that many lives r going to change forever after the $GmE MOASS, and Ive been thinking about what the aftermath might be like, and where it all might go from there.

I havent really seen any big ideas or proposals that are retarded enough for this community to pursue after the MOASS; But that changes today, Because I (along with another retarded retard) have come up with a rough outline of GameStop The Nation-State

We know the price is wrong, we know that GameStop is a multi-trillion dollar company, and we know that theres close to a million heavily invested apes that may or may not be interested in developing a nation powered by GameStop.

This may sound ridiculous, and it absolutely is, but i have faith in our cognitively limited smoothbrains, and believe we can find a plausible route to becoming an internationally recognized government led by Emperor Ryan Cohen.

Now building a new country from scratch may pose some logistical problems, but I believe we can figure this shit out. After the MOASS well easily have enough bananas to afford an island/large area of open land to develop on. 

Our national currency will of course be $GME token, and by the time we finish constructing our banana utopia, GameStop will most likely be selling groceries, power tools, jetskis etc. So the only commercial store well ever need is GameStop. 

I could go into more detail about my outlines and projections if anyone is interested in this concept. I truly believe theres enough apes and enough resources to pull this off. 

If youre having trouble wrapping ur head around this idea, I recommend utilizing $THC as an aphrodisiac to open ur mind to the possibility of GameStop The Nation-State.

So- I have cash that can go poof. And I think, long term, META (Facebook's) big shift and investments into the ""Metaverse"" will be an utter failure, reminiscent of the Xbox Kinect. 

You know why? Just like the Kinect, meta is ALL. CRINGE.

The marketing? Cringe. The applications? Cringe. Discinnected from reality (literally and figuratively), and cringe. The uses and applications are not widely needed, nor wanted. Lets be honest- VR is cool. But novelty wears off fast- and I only touch my VR headset for Meta titties here and there. 

I just saw an AD pumping the metaverse by showing a woman ""pull"" her friend into a packed, hype concert through VR, as if she was there, and dance with her. It was the worst thing my eyes have ever seen. Are these people delusional?



In essense, I'm retarded. And I rolled my eyes at Microsoft pushing Kinect, knowing it would fail. Then I rolled my eyes at Apple over-hyping that stupid video avatar crap nobody cared about. And now I'm rolling my eyes at the metaverse itself.

And, lets be honest, ""Meta"" is still a heavily under-target company under federal scrutiny, and It also doesnt help that the cry***/nft (uh, cry*** is kinda fine, but NFTs are the biggest scams I've ever seen widely tolerated) bubbles could pop at any point, and many seem to correlate the metaverse to them entirely.

GameStop The Nation-State:


Okay So first Ill start off by saying we are NOTACULT, but as free thinking individual investors, we all know that many lives r going to change forever after the $GmE MOASS, and Ive been thinking about what the aftermath might be like, and where it all might go from there.

I havent really seen any big ideas or proposals that are retarded enough for this community to pursue after the MOASS; But that changes today, Because I (along with another retarded retard) have come up with a rough outline of GameStop The Nation-State

We know the price is wrong, we know that GameStop is a multi-trillion dollar company, and we know that theres close to a million heavily invested apes that may or may not be interested in developing a nation powered by GameStop.

This may sound ridiculous, and it absolutely is, but i have faith in our cognitively limited smoothbrains, and believe we can find a plausible route to becoming an internationally recognized government led by Emperor Ryan Cohen.

Now building a new country from scratch may pose some logistical problems, but I believe we can figure this shit out. After the MOASS well easily have enough bananas to afford an island/large area of open land to develop on. 

Our national currency will of course be $GME token, and by the time we finish constructing our banana utopia, GameStop will most likely be selling groceries, power tools, jetskis etc. So the only commercial store well ever need is GameStop. 

I could go into more detail about my outlines and projections if anyone is interested in this concept. I truly believe theres enough apes and enough resources to pull this off. 

If youre having trouble wrapping ur head around this idea, I recommend utilizing $THC as an aphrodisiac to open ur mind to the possibility of GameStop The Nation-State.

1,"11/07/2021, 10:32:16",The three Ms youll want by Monday,Joa1907,"Gather round fellow companions, grab your wifes boyfriends wallets and let me introduce you to this tendie factory opportunity for you to put money you cannot afford to lose and change your life.

Although I like eating Mac n cheese, mj and masturbating on any Friday night, today I call for your attention for three different Ms, literally. $MMM is a manufacturing company blah blah boring shit, they have their hands on basically everything including sticky notes, paint, medical respirators and a lot more stuff especially construction stuff.

THE ANALYSIS

Bidens infrastructure plan passed congress, many companies will benefit. The thing is, 3M is so broadly present in the sectors that will be invested on by the government that it is nearly impossible for it not to benefit. Its like that awkward friend that you knows everyone around you so he goes to all the parties and stuff but you dont really know know them and just awkwardly say hi, but he seems to be really close to everyone you know just not you for some reason ya feel? 

Anyways, offering EV battery solutions, mostly insulating materials; and we know how hot that sector is right now.

But not only EVs will benefit, 3M is all around the manufacturing industry with abrasives, paints, bonding and more. Even touching the Broadcom sector.

What I mean is, when Biden passed this bill, 3M execs bought a Beverly Hills house for each one of their dogs toys. And these are rich dogs. Think about it.

THE TA

Now for the part that you are waiting for, your daily horoscope reading for a random stock with badly drawn lines and numbers you dont understand but dont worry cause I dont either.

See, the stock has been trading in this triangle, which is on the brink of breakout, in fact when voting started for the bill on Friday morning we can see how much momentum it gained; until they said they were delaying voting.

https://charts.equityclock.com/3m-company-nysemmm-seasonal-chart

Also heres graphs of stock performance during the months of September through December, beating SPY by about 2% and there are not weak months for SPY usually.

CONCLUSION

MMM is primed for a breakout Monday after the bill passing. The best part is the price of the contracts, with 190 contracts being merely around $30. With the movement of this stock Friday morning, I am sure the stock will rally with this incredible catalyst.

Some additional notes to add context to this DD:

- Autodesk has changed it's billing structure due to no long relying on licenced agreements for income. It is not more streamlined like Adobe after deeply rearchitecting for the cloud using Amazon and AWS. 

- Autodesk Forge is an API product that may see extensive use in markets like the metaverse, despite Autodesk Maya already being relevant in gaming or movies.

- Autodesk Flex is a counter for piracy of expensive licenced or subscribed products. As I like to put it, piracy means there's a high demand for the product and a problem in its supply. It's a supply chain problem for software. 

- Autodesk Build is a spend management software which may be relevant as trillions of dollars continue to be injected into infrastructure markets.  

- Fusion360 is a great introductory tool and funnel into the Autodesk ecosystem that ranges from water infrastructure to cinematic development.

# TL;DR

Meaningful, sustainable, long-term employment.

The current administration and Federal Reserve are continuing to progress in setting the stage for long-term investments in the American economy. In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments per year for 8 years in infrastructure spending. We take a look at how Autodesk is a core benefactor of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size by 2024.

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**

\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**

\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**

\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**

**-** What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(You are here)**

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*

\- Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*

\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so thats why Im sharing my writing. Im not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The Employment Problem

&gt;The **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (or **Industry 4.0**) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.

&amp;#x200B;

[A Skill Gap Problem](https://preview.redd.it/sbi6dmoy6zq61.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cad0f9dc367ce723290f7ae65f97f702812041d)

Ultimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining  its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others. This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools. In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.

Tools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired. In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors. Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures.

The problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.

[Autodesk's recognition of its role, alongside organizations like Adobe.](https://preview.redd.it/kvm8z2md8zq61.png?width=1588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d865498e39ddeff11d800b4e8e904d6137539c)

# The Education Solution

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ly24pppuezq61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab25ce2945104acb0f3c4d3816cb713db1af238

The reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands. We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar ""languages"". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.

What I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.

# AutoDesk's Role

AutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars. There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.

\- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.

\- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.

\- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.

1,"11/07/2021, 08:46:17",Dividend + Put Strategy,StonksOnlyGoUp1200,"We all look at dividends as a minuscule percentage that is almost worthless compared to buying fd's. But some stocks have dividends of over 10%, but there is a drawback. To purchase a dividend, you have to buy the stock before the ex-dividend date, and wait for the payout. The stock could fall massively between the waiting period, and the payout day. 

This is where puts come into play. If you hedge your stock purchase with puts, it is almost guaranteed to become profitable. Even if the stock rises, you'll make money off the stock itself and the dividend. If the stock falls, you have the put, and the dividend to cover for it. If the stock is flat, well you still have the dividend. 

However, stocks usually fall after ex-dividend dates- especially those of high yields.

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/ex\_dividend.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/ex_dividend.asp)

But this strategy only works with high dividend yields. Thankfully, there are approximately 34 large companies (over 2 billion market cap.) on the NYSE with yields over 8%.

[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=cap\_midover,exch\_nyse,fa\_div\_o8&amp;o=-marketcap&amp;r=21](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=cap_midover,exch_nyse,fa_div_o8&amp;o=-marketcap&amp;r=21)

Note that the put value does not have to be under 8% of your total investments if you are willing to take risks.

The following strategy could produce gains from 5%-15% EACH time you do this. 

Lets take a lowball average of 1.06% gains.

1,"11/07/2021, 06:03:42",BMRA,Plane_Ad_5154,"Why BMRA Will Squeeze And Why It Is High Conviction; The Naked Short Position Explained

The daily dark pool volume from October 1st is missing 20 million shares.  The dark pool will buy and sell to itself, but generally the buy/short sell volume ends the day at approximately a 50:50 ratio.  In the case of October 1st, we have short sale volume to buy ratios of 70:30.  Those shorted shares, totalling 20 million, were likely consumed by retail buyers or funds.  The DTCC/NSCC is on the hook for those synthetic shares because they become FTDs/FTRs.  An FTD/FTR is basically an I.O.U. that goes on the DTCCs books (we will give you the shares when we have them).

What happens is that you have many different investors who are claiming to own the same shares.  As demand for more shares increases, the IOUs hit a threshold where stock needs to be acquired.  It isnt only options that create a GME-style gamma squeeze, but also the multiple claims on the same shares.

So looking at PROG, we see a similar set-up.  Short volume selling exceeds the buying settled volume.  As the IOUs build up, the naked short seller begins moving synthetic shares into FTDs/FTRs, an open interest short position, or rolling the position out for future settlement.

The issue with PROG is that they diluted with shares when the squeeze began.  Sometimes this is done by the short seller who offers sweetheart deal financing to the execs because it is cheaper than the consequences of a squeeze.  The diluted shares are then immediately used to settle the synthetic short position. (This isnt a knock on PROG, and it doesnt mean it still wont squeeze, but it becomes a lifeline to the naked shorts)

BMRA has committed to no financing.  The synthetic short (naked short) has been caught out in deep water.  They can not continue to add to their naked short position under the scrutiny of the DTCC, and if they place the shares into open short interest that will only further the squeeze.

As we saw today, once pressure was applied to the stock (volume), there was almost no selling resistance.  This is a lock-up situation, where there are very few actual shares available.  Shares that are consumed in the dark pool are used to settle the FTD/FTRs, all while retail and funds also demand shares as well during the day.  Options that print create an entirely new demand, as those positions settle in the money and the investor takes delivery.

Please see this video on failure-to-deliver, and how the DTCC takes ownership of them:  https://youtu.be/h-N_C8ghLHY

This will squeeze hard.  BMRA is aware of the naked short position.  FinTel is aware of the naked short position.  FINRA data which I will post this weekend shows the unaccounted for 20 million shares in their consolidated report.  Nakedshortreport.com shows the naked short position from Oct 1st (screenshots available on this board) and now we are seeing retail investors and funds that are becoming aware of the short position.  Worthy of a notable mention, we have also seen the open short interest increase or decrease in a day at volumes that 2x the daily reported volume.

*Added*

If you look at $GME, we see an accumulated FTD/FTR of 100% of the float.  This is current, after the squeeze.  So when you see GME spiking every now and again, that is because there are still 77 million FTD/FTRs on GME that need to be settled.  The stock will continue to move up higher every time retail churn slows, or until GME issues more shares.

I dont know what the cumulative FTDs/FTRs data is for BMRA, but the first week of October shows that 15% of the O/S is in FTD/FTR, and this does not include the critical Oct 4th FTD/FTR data from the 90,000,000 share volume day.  

If we take a step back and look at things at face value, we can see this:
- Approx 4,500,000 shares are held by insiders and institutions
- Approx 6,000,000 shares are in the trading float.

How does a stock trade 90,000,000 shares in one day, coming off an average volume of 200,000 shares, and only go up $3 (15x the free float)?  

How, after a 90,000,000 share day, is there consistent selling (ratios of short volume exceeds buy volume in the dark pool, aka naked short selling) to the point that the price is driven down so aggressively in such a short period of time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qoae4i/bmra/

1,"11/07/2021, 05:53:28",HIMX DD To Da Moon,yimiemie,"If you are interested in HIMX, now is the time to buy! Let's talk FY-2021 cash dividend.

\[Edited to correct grammar and typos.\]

**Background**

HIMX released earnings for Q3-2021 that places year-to-date earnings at $1.69 per share. Guidance indicates further earnings of $0.745 - $0.795 per share for Q4-2021. So HIMX is effectively guiding $2.43 - $2.48 per share for FY-2021, which corresponds to a deeply undervalued forward PE of 4.62 - 4.71.  (I am using todays closing price of $11.45 as my basis for calculating the PE range.)

HIMX will also be paying an annual dividend based on FY-2021 earnings. This dividend is historically declared in sometime May (or June) and paid sometime in June (or July). The dividend could be a catalyst that finally starts to move HIMX to new highs.

**Dividend Table**

I have prepared a table showing the dividend paid by HIMX for every fiscal year since its IPO in 2006 (see below). Its purpose is to highlight the payout ratios for each of the 13 years that HIMX has paid a dividend. The payout ratio is the proportion of HIMXs annual EPS that is paid out as a cash dividend. In the table, you can see that the payout ratio has ranged anywhere from 51.3% to 119.0%, with an average of 77.9%.  I note that three instances of the payout ratio were at 100% or above.

I believe that, for Q4-2021 and similar to Q3-2021, HIMX will post earnings at the upper limit of its guidance (i.e., $0.795/share). Using the average ratio of 77.9% with FY-2021 earnings of $2.48/share, we can estimate the cash dividend for 2021 to be $1.932 per share. This estimate implies a mind-boggling forward yield of 16.9% using todays closing price. In comparison, the dividend yield for the S&amp;P 500 and the iShares Semiconductor ETF is 1.38% and 0.61%, respectively.

**Discussion**

HIMX pays out a very high proportion of its annual EPS as a cash dividend. To understand why, realize that Taiwan gives special tax considerations for dividends. In particular, a Taiwanese company which owns shares in another Taiwanese company is, regardless of the percentage ownership, exempt from business income tax on the dividends received from another Taiwanese company.

For example, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu is the founder and chairman of HIMX. He holds 74,579,944 ordinary shares of HIMX through two Taiwanese investment companies, i.e., Sanfair Asia Investments Ltd. and Chi-Duan Investment Co. (One ordinary share of HIMX is equal to one-half a U.S.-listed ADS and receives one-half of the dividend.) If HIMX declares a dividend of $1.932 per share, the two investment companies will collectively receive $72,044,256 *tax-free* on behalf of Dr. Wu. A similar arrangement exists for Mr. Jordan Wu, the CEO of HIMX and brother of Dr. Biing-Seng Wu.  Mr. Wu, however, has established different Taiwanese investment companies for this purpose.

The point here is that HIMXs board and executive management have a serious tax incentive to pay themselves using dividends. Moreover, because HIMX did not declare a dividend for either 2018 or 2019, the board and executive management will be highly incentivized to issue themselves a fat dividend in 2022 to make up for these missing years. So the $1.932 amount I estimated above is a very real possibility and may even be conservative.

**Conclusion**

The impending 2022 cash dividend is very bad news for anyone short HIMX. As of October 15, the short interest in HIMX sits at 24,652,040 shares (or 14.1% of the float). At an estimated forward yield of 16+%, the shorts in HIMX are deluding themselves into thinking that they can *slow-roast prime rib in front of a ravenous pride of lions and not get mauled*.

The market is going to smell HIMXs juicy dividend months in advance and start buying long before the dividend is declared. I believe the trigger point for such buying will be the Q4-2021 earnings announcement, during which, the FY-2022 EPS will be confirmed. Based on historical norms, HIMX should release Q4-2021 earnings the first week of February.

If you are interested in HIMX, now is the time to start buying. Today's post-earnings jump in price may be the start of a strong movement upward, just like November of last year.  If HIMX moves to adjust its forward yield to 5%  which would still be better than every other semiconductor stock on the NASDAQ  HIMX will move from its present price of $11.45 to north of $30. So by buying now, not only would you get to experience fantastic gains, you will most likely also be rewarded with a fat dividend (if you are willing to hold until July).

Factors like pride, sexualization of wealth, and the pursuit of power have caused many traders to act on delusional belief or miss good opportunities or continue trading regardless if any good investments present themselves.

For starters, you will often find corporate execs complaining that ""predatory short sellers"" are screwing their valuations or spreading false allegations. Warren Buffet said this makes him ""mighty suspicious"" as this is often a sign the execs are concealing fraud, but often they aren't. Most execs have a large portion of their net worth tied to the share price and their status as a Fortune 500 company or whatever can be threatened by how market valuations rise and fall. That sounds silly, but then again pride does go before the fall.

Buffet also isn't immune to this, as during one interview with a young female reporter the question came up of how much cash he kept in his wallet at any given time. He showed he kept enough cash to take his wife to a fancy restaurant but mentioned as he drew his wallet that a lot of women want to see what's inside his wallet... The inference was clear, and not unique to Buffet.

Sergei Wennergold, one of the most notorious market manipulators of all time, had sex as a motive. He broke up with his girlfriend so he planted a bomb near a professional football team and then bought puts on the company that owned it. He was caught immediately due to the highly unusual options activity being traced to him, but due to various clues it's believed his intention was to show up at his ex's house in a sports car to win her back.

Corporate raiding in general is not really a strategy for making money, but for gaining power. Men like Carl Icahn will see in the news certain corporate decisions they think should change, buy up a gigantic pile of shares to get on the board of directors, and cause drama. You should question the motive when the investment thesis is literally ""I know better than the CEO."" When you consider corporate raiding from the perspective of a turf war, however, it's a wonder you mostly see only legal actions (injunctions, proxy fights, poison pills) and not more actual violence.

Many Environmental, Social and Governance investors are no different, as the investment thesis of many of these is a desire to incentivize select behaviors. This is not to disparage their intentions, I say we just be frank they're trying to use money to gain a little power over others.

Trading forums like this one are no different. You will find people who feel personally threatened by the existence of investment thesis' contrary to their own. These guys know who they are, and are definitely not trading the fundamentals or the macroeconomics, but instead want dominance. There are some people who bought over-shorted stocks for the express purpose of making some random short seller go bust. There are people who buy great companies and berate people who use the word ""overvalued."" There are people with delusions that markets are fundamentally predatory... Who yet desire to actively participate.

Also, there is always a surplus of active traders because trading is fun while passive investing is boring. Yes, I personally fall firmly in this category.

And most importantly, there's people who lost it all because they refused to take profits when they were up as much as 10,000%. Some of the numbers being insane enough where men who became overnight millionaires are somehow not satisfied with those gains. Gains that could allow you could invest in bonds and not have to worry or work for the rest of their lives.

How does this effect our trading decisions? First off, we can't take anyone's word for anything even if they have no position. Arguments from people saying hateful things or being sycophants are normally to be ignored, but depending how widespread they are you can use that as a factor for potential volatility. Corporations pumping their own stock are usually uninvestable, and infighting on the board of directors is a solid sell signal especially if the feud effects their bottom line and/or inaction would be just as costly as the wrong action.

You will also see a lot of gimmicky actively managed investment funds that normally make barely enough alpha to justify the fees. Advocates of passive investing will say these guys are just finding ways to charge high fees, but a lot of these guys want to work in the fun side of investing. Many funds and traders have a tendency to keep tinkering with their positions regardless if it makes sense, trading to their own detriment. This effects trading volumes and fees for a lot of the actively managed funds you might look at.

Understanding these human factors can also be a potential source of tendies, however. While the market doesn't react to the rage-filled remarks of a VIP, you might buy puts and profit when the degeneracy kicks in. A stock may go up because it maintained profitability while its peers failed, but you may investigate and find they've been fudging their numbers to maintain their position. Or you may see how a disproportionate amount of attention is going into a stock artificially driving up the price of options, and use thetagang methods.

1,"11/07/2021, 05:11:13",Los Santos Police Department (LSPD) aka Lightspeed,Dry-Neck2539,"LSPD - the Speed of Light

What is Lightspeed:

Main services - cloud based ecommerce platform and in store Ipad point of sales hardware/system.
Ancillary services - multi-location inventory management, sales analytics, loyalty programs.
Allows for easy integration between online, mobile, and in-store sales (ie. purchase online with in-store pick-up option.
Main customers - small to medium retailers and wholesalers including hospitality, restaurants, golf courses ect.

It maintained 50% growth rate during the pandemic, which is amazing.


Operating Highlights:

50% YOY growth in locations (&gt;76,500 customers in &gt;100 countries).
70% YOY revenue growth with 90% of revenue reoccurring.
Current ratio = 3.29 (90% of current assets is cash - 210m).
Cash to total liabilities = 1.5x.

Difference between LSPD and SHOP:

SHOP is focused on ecommerce and is now moving into point of sales. SHOP's customers are often individuals doing small volume sales.
LSPD is focused on both ecommerce and point of sales simultaneously. LSPD's customers are often small to medium businesses (average sales per location of CA$600k in the prior FY) meaning LSPD services more stable businesses in general.

LSPD vs. SHOP Valuation Metrics:

Share price: CA$87 vs. CA$1,335
Market cap: CA$9.4B vs. CA$166B
YOY Revenue growth: 70% vs. 47%
Price to sales: 20 vs. 68
Price to book: 7 vs. 40

Reasons to be Bullish:

Near Term: SHOP investors looking to move profits into something with a more attractive valuation.
Near Term: LSPD is trading well below its high of $79 and currently has short-term momentum that will likely see it trade above $70 this week.
Long-Term: LSPD launched services in the US in January 2019. 
Long-Term: Achieving profitability.
Long-Term: Potential acquisitions (either SHOP acquires LSPD or LSPD acquires smaller players).


Conclusion: LSPD is a high-growth stock with a solid balance sheet that is trading at a massive discount to SHOP. I recommend taking a position while the valuation is attractive and before it becomes a household name like SHOP.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo9dtl/los_santos_police_department_lspd_aka_lightspeed/

Friday morning I woke up to a dream where I was being chased out of my house only to stumble across a street with a swinging tire by a tree. Upon pausing and looking closer the name of the street sign was ContextLogic I dumped my Boeing calls Friday morning for a 15k gain, (missed out another 20k thanks dream) and made a Wish with all my margin. I told my friends and they made some wishes as well. Next, infrastructure bill just passed and Fisker is extremely undervalued at 6 billion market cap. with rivian IPO coming up and LA auto show Nov 18 Fisker will reveal plenty of innovation and features in its brand new vehicle FISKER Ocean  which starts deliveries 2022.

Tldr: Buy bntx stock/calls

Alright guys i never write DD because i failed to pass elementary school and my grammar is poor but here something for you little dick gambling addicts. 

Bntx : the partner of Pfizer with their covid vaccine

Pfe just had amazing earnings and expects to sell a fuckton of vaccines. Bntx takes half the profit. Now if youve noticed, Bntx has gotten fucked silly the last couple weeks, even though it got booster approval by FDA. Pfe gave us an insight into BNTX earnings which is tuesday, and its clearly going to beat esimates nicely. So why all the downward pressure? 

1. Moderna is a peice of shit and drags the price down. 

2. Bntx is getting dragged down because something big is brewing and big boys want to get in as cheap as possible. 

Pfe with their new covid pill shits on MRK. So why wouldnt PFE want to dominate the covid market with both the pill and vaccine? 

BNTX is currently at a Market cap of 55B or so, with about 7B in revenue per quarter ( talk about undervalued) while MRNA is at 100B +

Bntx is also presenting their cancer trials shortly after earnings, and with all the downward pressure it brought in big volume for the furst time in months (easier for the big guys to load more)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo96zy/bntx_and_why_i_think_something_big_is_brewing/

1,"11/07/2021, 02:54:19",Mueller Industries Quick Evaluation / Bull Case,Mequon_Man,"I know its November, so Im gonna try to keep this discussion somewhat long to distract you from committing mortal sin. Today I am presenting an analysis on Mueller Industries, a company that even after a recent runup seems undervalued in a seemingly overvalued market.

**Mueller Industries, Inc. Ticker = (MLI)**

\----------------------------------------------

**Basic Stats:**

* $3.2B Market cap
* 0.9 P/S Ratio
* 2.92 P/B Ratio
* 8.17 P/E Ratio
* 0.003% of shares outstanding traded each day
* 33.67% increase in the past month (compared to 7.73% S&amp;P 500)
* 0.002% of net shares bought/exercised by insiders since 8/1/2021

Mueller Industries makes a variety of products using copper, plastic, brass, and aluminum. The companys largest segment is copper-related products, including pipes and fittings. Copper prices have increased in recent months, so some of Muellers recent outperformance may be related to this trend; MLIs stock price performance in the past has been weaker in less accommodative copper markets.

\----------------------------------------------

**Basic Financials:**

Values displayed are in millions of dollars\*.

|Financial Metric|2018|2019|2020|2021 (through Q3)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Equity|548|643|777|1,108|
|Long Term Debt|497|386|328|121|
|Revenue|2,508|2,431|2,398|2813|
|Net Profit|119|131|154|348|
|Share Price|23.67|31.67|35.11|56.42|

\*Before making any investment decisions please make sure to double-check these values against published financial information.

The finances of the company are sound, and the company is valued at low price to book and price to earnings ratios. The company also has a relatively low amount of debt, which has decreased dramatically in recent quarters. The share price of Mueller Industries has not kept up with profit and equity growth, and this presents an opportunity to purchase the company at a relatively low valuation.

\----------------------------------------------

**Institutional Ownership:**

* 90.17% Institutional Ownership
* 6.93% Retail Ownership (non-insider/institutional)
* 15.5% Owned by Blackrock Inc.
* 10.6% Owned by Vanguard

Many companies, especially in the tech sector (looking at you Nvidia), have been overvalued and overhyped by retail investment. MLIs low retail ownership and high institutional ownership demonstrates that this company is not overhyped, and this is reflected in the P/E ratio. Institutional investors likely see this company as a safe, undervalued stock due to these factors. This bodes well for the company as an investment and coupled with the recent growth and solid financials, show that this company has great potential.

\----------------------------------------------

**Disclaimer:**

* Not good financial advice
* Copper prices factor into this companys performance
* Author plans to initiate share position in MLI on Monday morning",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo6px6/mueller_industries_quick_evaluation_bull_case/

Is there some method like a covered call and selling a put or something where you can maximize what you get either way?

Im looking to use some stocks that I have to generate some income because I believe someday theyll go up, but it wont be soon.

I was wondering if there was some way to combine calls and puts to protect yourself in a big way or even maximize the money you can make in a weeks time or so.

1,"11/07/2021, 01:40:22",Shit Coin BUBBLE,Puzzleheaded-Meet21,"Lot of discussion about how ""shit coins"" are like the 90s dot com bubble. I think its true to an extent, but I figured I would do some DD to support my thoughts. My view is that while this may be a bubble and all bubbles burst, they are also the best way to mainstream a new prolific technology. Here is the data that we should consider:

There are 80,000,000 wallet holders worldwide ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/)\_. It's taken nearly 10 years to get there. That is VERY slow for a transformative technology like this. However, access has been somewhat prohibitive to the average human. That has changed with all the things many of you hate: RobinHood, Centralized Exchanges and ""Shit Coins""/""Meme Coins"". 

The dot com bubble lasted about 5 years between 1995 and 2000. During those 5 years global internet usage went from 16 million to 350 million ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com\_bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), [https://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm](https://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm)). 

Basically this puts Blockchain, in Internet years, at about 1997 with much slower adoption rate SO FAR. What all of the excitement here and everywhere on the Internet does for Blockchain is to attract users, create liquidity in the market, and mainstream blockchain technologies and currencies. 

So, what do you do with this insight? 

1. Stop bashing shit coins/meme coins - because you are only hurting yourself. We MUST have new users and new people researching and educating (even if it is lessons learned in losses)
2. Stop looking for overnight millions - it's still 1997, there is a ways to go yet. A few of us will win the lottery but more most of us, it will take time measured in years not hours or days. 
3. Tell your friends, family, everyone who will listen to get on the train...like I had to in the 1990s in convincing people AOL was worth a try. If you don't have users the Internet itself would have been useless. If you don't have new buyers in Blockchain, the currencies will also be useless (which they mostly are in reality at the moment)

Positions: Jan 2023 Calls on URA, \[Redacted\], \[Redacted\], \[Redacted\], CCJ

I initially bought into uranium in early Sep dabbling my toes in U.UN, added way more between then and now using margin with momma's investments as collateral. Synthetic shares (short put, long calls) almost margin called my ass but that's the price you pay for mutated radioactive perma-hard dick.

[Uranium Bull Thesis](https://josephcollinsul.medium.com/the-uranium-bull-thesis-ce6d49ebd219) and more resources at a certain uranium sub but I'll summarize what stimulates me.

**HOW URANIUM WORKS**

Basically, uranium is only used in energy production in nuclear reactors. You can get uranium from mining and decommissioned nukes.

At the moment, it's also the only sensible choice in replacing fossil fuels. Renewables are either geographically constrained or unreliable. You still need a stable baseload that is available 24/7. We've seen big energy storage projects (some Tesla bull just came) but between the lack of batteries for EVs and the still developing energy storage scene, nuclear is the here and now that has been time tested to be working.

**WHAT STIMULATES ME (Back in September)**

1. Demand/Supply deficit. Basically, year production of uranium cannot keep up with demand of uranium.
2. Draw down of inventories. This mainly consists of stockpiles by utilities, supply after Japan's nuclear shutdown posts Fukushima and nuclear material from decommissioned nukes ([Megaton to Megawatts program](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel.aspx))
3. Shift to EVs. More EVs mean a shift of energy needs from oil to electricity, the energy required by these cars will require more sources of energy. You can generate electricity from oil but not the other way round, nuclear will benefit this increase in electricity need.
4. Price of uranium is still below the production cost for many companies (Roughly $60 based on what I've heard). IMO, this means this uranium play really can't go tits up (unless you get margin called out of your positions like I almost did).
5. Small sector size. The total market cap of all uranium companies was under 40B back in Sep. Incoming cash will move this very easily.
6. Commodities to equities ratio. It's even lower than peak dot-com bubble.
7. [Sprott Physical Uranium Fund](https://www.sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/), goes pacman on the uranium spot market, vacuuming up supply. Has no redemption feature, so it's an one-way trip for uranium (long gone like the ex-girlfriend who will never return). Since inception on 19 July, it has amassed 36.4 million pounds of uranium, equivalent to roughly 20% of the annual consumption.
8. To a nuclear power plant, the cost of uranium is miniscule. Compared to the cap-ex and other operating costs, it's much more important that the plant continues running than the cost of acquiring the uranium.

**WHAT STIMULATES ME (NOW)**

Somehow, even more bullish news came out in this two months. I'm almost as excited as I was when I was 4k from margin call during a pullback after opening 2500 synthetic shares in uranium after it ran up.

1. China's 440B plan to build 150 new reactors between now and 2035. Allegedly, this is more than the total number that have been built around the world since 1980. A bit of digging showed that we have 442 operational reactors around the world, so might have been a reporting error comparing planned reactor units to built reactor plants. Still bull dick size bullish anyways.

1.1 I [wrote up](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/qmg343/a_political_take_on_chinas_shift_to_uranium/) a short bit on the political side of China's turn to nuclear energy

2. [Small modular reactors](https://www.energy.gov/ne/benefits-small-modular-reactors-smrs). Basically, factory manufactured nuclear reactors compared to current site built reactors. Advantages include, increased accessibility, lower cap-ex, increased security as the reactors are designed to be safe from the get go, addressing terror attacks and natural disaster risks. NuScale's SMR [reportedly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2018/08/29/how-far-do-you-have-to-run-after-a-small-modular-nuclear-meltdown/?sh=2e4a15b57393) can't even meltdown, it just cools off.

3. EU's energy crisis. In the previous years, EU decided to shift to renewables in a bid to reduce carbon emissions, which in hindsight was a bad idea after these renewables showed their flaw in being unreliable, leaving EU's energy security in Russia's hands (EU is heavily reliant on Russia for natural gas exports). The natural gas shortage has sent natural gas prices up 6 times since April and this will the EU rethink their stance on nuclear.

3.1. France doubled down on nuclear with a 5 year, 35B plan with 1B going to fund small modular reactors.

3.2. UK's net-zero plan heavily relies on nuclear with big investments going into Rolls-Royce's small modular reactors.

4. Japan's Liberal Democratic Party wins the election. This group is positive towards nuclear, allowing restarts of existing nuclear plants to meet Japan's energy needs. They have not agreed to building of any new plants but they've not out rightly rejected the notion unlike the 2nd largest party, Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.

5. [Kazatomprom](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-announces-physical-uranium-fund) creates their own physical uranium fund. [Reportedly](https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1451970084746903560), the fund will create a base spot price of $80-90.

6. [Sprott buys over \[Redacted\]](https://www.sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-asset-management-enters-agreement-with-north-shore-indices-inc-to-acquire-licensing-rights-to-the-index-tracked-by-the-north-shore-global-uranium-mining-etf/), bring exposure to its large base of commodities investors.

**Post Nut**

The macro-economics of uranium is ultra-bullish. It's cyclical so you have previous years' data to compare to, (Spot price hit $134/pound in 2007 on less bullish news). Mining might not be easily understood by many of you (me included), so just buy an ETF like URA or URNM.

Buying mining companies is basically leveraging yourself already, when their cost remains fixed, the % increase in uranium prices will be amplified in the % increase of earnings and thus stock price.

***~~Secret Sauce (White)~~***

~~You may or may not be able to weaponize the physical uranium funds. If large interest appears and a lot of money is directed to the physical uranium funds, it causes these funds to lock away a lot of uranium, intensifying the supply shortage, causing the utilities companies that are short of uranium to come scrambling to the negotiation table to cover their asses (sounds familiar? when shorts are forced to cover?).~~",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3g44/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/

At the moment, it's also the only sensible choice in replacing fossil fuels. Renewables are either geographically constrained or unreliable. You still need a stable baseload that is available 24/7. We've seen big energy storage projects (some Tesla bull just came) but between the lack of batteries for EVs and the still developing energy storage scene, nuclear is the here and now that has been time tested to be working.

**WHAT STIMULATES ME (Back in September)**

1. Demand/Supply deficit. Basically, year production of uranium cannot keep up with demand of uranium.
2. Draw down of inventories. This mainly consists of stockpiles by utilities, supply after Japan's nuclear shutdown posts Fukushima and nuclear material from decommissioned nukes ([Megaton to Megawatts program](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel.aspx))
3. Shift to EVs. More EVs mean a shift of energy needs from oil to electricity, the energy required by these cars will require more sources of energy. You can generate electricity from oil but not the other way round, nuclear will benefit this increase in electricity need.
4. Price of uranium is still below the production cost for many companies (Roughly $60 based on what I've heard). IMO, this means this uranium play really can't go tits up (unless you get margin called out of your positions like I almost did).
5. Small sector size. The total market cap of all uranium companies was under 40B back in Sep. Incoming cash will move this very easily.
6. Commodities to equities ratio. It's even lower than peak dot com bubble.
7. [Sprott Physical Uranium Fund](https://www.sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/), goes pacman on the uranium spot market, vacuuming up supply. Has no redemption feature, so it's an one-way trip for uranium (long gone like the ex-girlfriend who will never return). Since inception on 19 July, it has amassed 36.4 million pounds of uranium, equivalent to roughly 20% of the annual consumption.
8. To a nuclear power plant, the cost of uranium is miniscule. Compared to the cap-ex and other operating costs, it's much more important that the plant continues running than the cost of acquiring the uranium.

**WHAT STIMULATES ME (NOW)**

Somehow, even more bullish news came out in this two months. I'm almost as excited as I was when I was 4k from margin call during a pullback after opening 2500 synthetic shares in uranium after it ran up.

1. China's 440B plan to build 150 new reactors between now and 2035. Allegedly, this is more than the total number that have been built around the world since 1980. A bit of digging showed that we have 442 operational reactors around the world, so might have been a reporting error comparing planned reactor units to built reactor plants. Still bull dick size bullish anyways.

1.1 I [wrote up](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/qmg343/a_political_take_on_chinas_shift_to_uranium/) a short bit on the political side of China's turn to nuclear energy

2. [Small modular reactors](https://www.energy.gov/ne/benefits-small-modular-reactors-smrs). Basically, factory manufactured nuclear reactors compared to current site built reactors. Advantages include, increased accessibility, lower cap-ex, increased security as the reactors are designed to be safe from the get go, addressing terror attacks and natural disaster risks. NuScale's SMR [reportedly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2018/08/29/how-far-do-you-have-to-run-after-a-small-modular-nuclear-meltdown/?sh=2e4a15b57393) can't even meltdown, it just cools off.

3. EU's energy crisis. In the previous years, EU decided to shift to renewables in a bid to reduce carbon emissions, which in hindsight was a bad idea after these renewables showed their flaw in being unreliable, leaving EU's energy security in Russia's hands (EU is heavily reliant on Russia for natural gas exports). The natural gas shortage has sent natural gas prices up 6 times since April and this will the EU rethink their stance on nuclear.

3.1. France doubled down on nuclear with a 5 year, 35B plan with 1B going to fund small modular reactors.

3.2. UK's net-zero plan heavily relies on nuclear with big investments going into Rolls-Royce's small modular reactors.

4. Japan's LDP wins the election. This group is positive towards nuclear, allowing restarts of existing nuclear plants to meet Japan's energy needs. They have not agreed to building of any new plants but they've not out rightly rejected the notion unlike the 2nd largest party, CDP.

5. [Kazatomprom](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-announces-physical-uranium-fund) creates their own physical uranium fund. [Reportedly](https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1451970084746903560), the fund will create a base spot price of $80-90.

6.

**Post Nut**

The macro-economics of uranium is ultra-bullish. It's cyclical so you have previous years' data to compare to, (Spot price hit $134/pound in 2007 on less bullish news). Mining might not be easily understood by many of you (me included), so just buy an ETF like URA or URNM.

Buying mining companies is basically leveraging yourself already, when their cost remains fixed, the % increase in uranium prices will be amplified in the % increase of earnings and thus stock price.

~~You may or may not be able to weaponize the physical uranium funds. If large interest appears and a lot of money is directed to the physical uranium funds, it causes these funds to lock away a lot of uranium, intensifying the supply shortage, causing the utilities companies that are short of uranium to come scrambling to the negotiation table to cover their asses (sounds familiar? when shorts are forced to cover?).~~",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3da4/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/

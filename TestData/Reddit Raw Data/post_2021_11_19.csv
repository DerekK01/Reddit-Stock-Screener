I did not want to post it once I was unbanned because the run was already underway.

To me, this is a clear signal that something very big is about to happen in this space.

**UP OR DOWN?**

Being   that cannabis is about 70% off its highs from earlier this year, I   struggle with how we can go much lower especially with every analyst PT   well above our current levels.

Its currently November and we have a must pass NDAA that has cannabis banking reform worked in through the SAFE banking act.

Banking   has long been viewed as the ultimate catalyst for this sector. There    is  a ton of money that wants to invest but is not allowed to enter due    to  federal regulations. JPM solidifies this statement with today's   move.

There has been a lot of   discussion as to whether or not SAFE banking would make it into the   final NDAA. Schumer recently stated that he has no issues with safe   banking, assuming he can get broad reform attached and social equity  included.

Just last weekend,   minority owned cannabis businesses pleaded with federal  regulators to    pass SAFE banking into the NDAA as social equity is already being    worked into many state regulations, and not having access to a bank   account is a much larger threat to their businesses.

I   feel there is enough momentum on both sides to see this through in   2021. GOP states are scrambling to add legalization legislation. Schumer   will read the room and either get broader reform (legalization) into   the NDAA or he will allow SAFE banking to pass as its absolutely   necessary.

**WHO DOES THIS HURT?**

Right now, any cannabis stock not operating on the Nasdaq, TSX or NYSE.

In short, multi-state operators (MSO's) are about to get fucked really hard.

They  are going to lose access to shareholder capital and this will really   slow their ability to scale against global competitors.

**WHO DOES THIS BENEFIT?**

Mother fucking Tilray.

MSO's in need of capital will now need to look towards companies like Tilray when they're in a pinch and need a bailout.

Flush   with cash and a 4B/y revenue plan through acquisitions, I expect  Tilray  to take advantage of this opportunity in a big way.

Additionally,   this should condense a very large investor pool down to the few   companies that have been able to gain access to the NYSE and the Nasdaq   creating a massive funnel to the likes of TLRY, CGC and (wow) ACB.

**HOW DOES** **ARCHEGOS FACTOR IN?**

This is a preemptive move by JPM because they do not want to become the next credit suisse and get wrecked by guys like Bill Hwang.

**TILRAY, Catadel and THE CORRELATION IN MEME's**

I have been trading TLRY since november of last year following the   announcement of the APHA merger. I was long in APHA prior to the news drop and shifted into TLRY shortly thereafter.

Anyone who spends their days with their eyes glued to memes can tell you there is absolutely a correlation in them all.

I believe, as many of you do, that this correlation comes from Catadel.

Tilray is currently the only cannabis company they have any exposure too, both short and long.

Why is this? CGC is the preferred fund play, so why Tilray?

***Because of GME. Because of AMC. Because retail is not allowed to win.***

Following  the move in GME, many other WSB plays made massive moves. Tilray  was  one of them, going all the way from 6 to 65 in just 4 months.

We  know Catadel is one of the main funds in this company and are likely  responsible for the extreme levels of volatility since our big move   earlier this year.

This wouldn't have been all to difficult considering the TLRY float is 85% owned by retail traders, they have the ability to play dork pool and trade shares across multiple foreign exchanges (TSX and  Frankfurt).

The Tilray float prior to its merger with APHA was tiny, this is why I dumped APHA for TLRY following the merge news.

Combining  the two floats gave Catadel an opportunity to hide positions and control the narrative. Being that this stock is owned mostly by retail and most those retail fools being us, they really couldn't help themselves.

\*\*UPDATE\*\*

**GERMANY:**

Tilray   stands above all others when it comes to capturing market share in the   newest and largest legal market in Europe. We are the first large  scale  producer in the country for Medical Cannabis and are the largest  player.  I dont need to explain this too much but legalization in  Germany is in  my opinion a larger catalyst for TLRY than legalization  in the US. This  is due to minimal competitors and already holding a  strong position  ahead of the open market.

Its   boots on the ground and infrastructure that will win as prohibition   unfolds and TLRY cannot be beat when it comes to Germany.

TLDR;

Knowing  that catadel is just as long as they are short and understanding that   broad reform is right around the corner, it is my belief that JPM  believes a massive move to the upside is getting ready to happen in ALL   of cannabis and they want to minimize the risk should catadel or any other bad actor decide to run cannabis to insane valuations such as Archegos did with DISCA and VIAC.

IF Catadel loses their battle with WSB this could be their only out, which is why its their only long in the space.

With most investors in Cannabis being retail, JPM surely cant be protecting themselves from us.

1. amazon.com/redfin redirects to their home services page    
2. Similar to the Affirm situation, I believe there is a unique node ID, but this time it is hidden by url redirects. The node ID [is contained in one of the redirect URLs](https://imgur.com/sLw6X2V) . The node ID does not yield any google search results leading me to believe it is tied to either an upcoming or abandoned project: https://www.amazon.com/b?node=12636722011    
3. redfin.com/amazon redirects to redfin.com/company/amazon, but no other error pages adds that company part to the URL as far as I can tell    
4. Amazon has tested the housing market in recent years. They had an [Amazon TurnKey](https://coverager.com/introducing-turnkey-in-partnership-with-amazon/) pilot program which was in partnership with Realogy but suspended it supposedly due to COVID.    
5. Both companies are conveniently headquartered in Seattle    



Unlike the Affirm situation, however, I do not know when these redirects were set up. For all I know, they could have been unnoticed for years and be a relic of some abandoned idea.  


The word Redfin [appears in the search bar](https://i.imgur.com/zzugyto.jpg) of the page you instantly get redirected from. On an iPad I was able to access the empty page. It isnt particularly telling though. Affirms page literally said Pay Over Time with Affirm in the search bar.  


What I think could happen: It looks like Amazon has tested the waters with its TurnKey endeavors and theyre ready to make a bigger foray into the housing market. I have no clue what that entails, but I think an acquisition of Redfin seems more likely than a partnership. This is not the first time [this idea has been floated](https://www.inman.com/2019/02/06/should-amazon-buy-redfin/) (tbh I havent even read the article cuz it has some pay wall lol but you get the point)  


Even if my prediction ends up being correct again, I have no clue what the timeline on something like this would be. Housing seems like a logistical nightmare unlike Affirm integration. Could be years. So.. dont go buying weekly call options because you read something dumb on reddit. However, if I am wrong, I still think Redfin is a solid company with massive upside so Im not worried.  


Honorable mention: amazon.com/cvs, however, there is no node ID and CVS supposedly rejected Amazon earlier this year. Wouldnt count on this one.

Using AI to trade  in dark pools over multiple exchanges give them the ability to basket   memes and control losses where they have over exposed themselves by selling shares that dont actually exist.

The Tilray float prior to its merger with APHA was tiny, this is why I dumped APHA for TLRY following the merge news.

1,"11/19/2021, 22:57:22",The bear case for CN/CP and possibly recession,tatoyale,"As we know the port of Vancouver has no access to rail to the rest of Canada. It is responsible for 3 million containers a year. And the companies making money running rail at the Vancouver port are Canadian National Railway (CNI/CNR) and Canadian Pacific railway (CP)**.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yrgsbpvlfk081.png?width=517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e52ab3aa57a067c07d4aef5b9e61bc70e737e2d1

For every month the Vancouver rail lines are out of commission about 250000 containers will be delayed or rerouted, about 3.3 billion in goods per month.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z9ucii5mfk081.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=029ff01ec6c9b86c31aef5ef6bca9fea1dbf4503

Currently, the Prince Rupert port is still connected but only has 2.5% of the capacity of the Vancouver port. There is an upgrade plan that would bring up capacity to 13% of the Vancouver port, afar in the future upgrade that probably wouldnt change the outcome of this event.

**Weather:**

The province is going into its rainy season. Historically it rains/snows the most going into the winter months which could slow repairs. Daylight hours are decreasing as we head into winter solstice. The flood water will also take time to drain away, I have no idea how long this takes. If freezing temperatures happen things could be royally messed up if the floodwater freezes in place.

**The trigger of a recession or bubble pop:**

This is all happening right before the Christmas season. **Vancouver is currently low on supplies and buying restrictions are starting to pop up in Edmonton where I live**. This flood has taken out the 2nd largest port on the west coast responsible for $40 billion worth of goods annually (3.3 billion a month). Also, the Vancouver port is the fastest major port in terms of shipping from Asia to the East coast of the US. This port is responsible for shipping your products like AMD or NVIDIA. Nvidia grew by 0.6 billion last quarter what if part of that 0.6 billion in growth is tied up in Vancouver right now or your other favorite company?. If there is a cascade of supply shortages there will likely be another panic like the toilet paper shortage but potentially much worse because everything will be out of stock.

https://preview.redd.it/wht0115vfk081.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfeae1e00e4d1c1d3664cf813cc0105cd4519b94

**Stock estimate:**

When covid hit the stock tanked to around $68 but this would probably hit easier than covid. Covid took down revenue for 2 quarters in 2020. This will last 1 quarter probably. A slight difference is that the pandemic did not cause infrastructure damage. The floods have caused major damage that needs damage assessed, repairs to be deployed, repair inspections, and approvals on top of any covid protocols, weather delays, supply shortages, and personnel or equipment logistics. If this DD gets popular a drop may happen fairly soon. If this remains fringe knowledge then the drop will probably happen after Q4 earnings on Jan 25, 2022, so keep that in mind.

I am more bearish on the rail companies over trucking or ship companies, I imagine they can find an alternative route. Even if supplies lines are completely taken over by trucks. This is money not going into CN or CP.

I predict large stock gains and new ATHs before a plunge just like the pandemic. Everyone is partying it up right now.

**CN vs CP**

CN and CP operate separate routes. CN can probably handle this better since they have access to 9 ports including Vancouver. While CP only has access to 4 ports. Even if they got ships to unload at their other ports they are all effectively on the Eastern side adding at least 7 days of delay for CN and 11 days for CP.

**Risks**:

It could all be a false alarm  but are multi week long delays good for the economy? Everyone wants gains to make up for covid losses or feel covid happened close enough for a recession. Analyst hype could keep this stock propped for a while. Many articles end in CN is a great buy or hold. The CEO of CN is doing great damage control stating saying that Prince Rupert is still running to keep investors calm but it is only 2.5% of Vancouver's capacity!

**$SIGA Technologies**

$SIGA is an emerging biodefense company that is focused on procuring smallpox anti-virals for the US government and their allies. The stock is extremely undervalued as it trades at no multiple at all which is strange for a biotech/biodefense company.   
   
 

&amp;#x200B;

During the third quarter of 2021, SIGA repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock, for approximately $7.1 million. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in March 2020, the Company has cumulatively repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock for approximately $49 million. 

 On Tuesday the 16th , SIGA made an announcement indicating that it was on the path for European approval of oral tecovirimat sold under the name TPOXX...

Currently the world has no oral treatment for small pox. It is given using a two-pronged (bifurcated) needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution That leaves a scar on the area between your biceps and shoulder. It is only are given to people who are exposed to it daily in lab environments. 

Background info 

**What is smallpox?**  
 

Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants, Variola major and Variola minor. The agent of variola virus (VARV) belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus.. Small pox has a 30% mortality rate with the last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977, and the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980. 

In the world only two labs are allowed to have small pox for future vaccine use. One in Russia and one in Atlanta, GA.

Recently a new vial was found in PA, [https://news.yahoo.com/vials-labeled-small-pox-found-in-lab-near-philadelphia-003127682.html](https://news.yahoo.com/vials-labeled-small-pox-found-in-lab-near-philadelphia-003127682.html)

The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating questionable vials labeled ""smallpox"" and found in a freezer last night at a Merck facility outside Philadelphia, according to an alert sent to Department of Homeland Security leadership on Tuesday night.

There were reportedly a total of 15 questionable vials, according to the unclassified ""For Official Use Only"" alert, a copy of which was obtained by Yahoo News. Five of the vials were labeled as smallpox and 10 were labeled as vaccinia."" The vials were secured immediately.

**What is TPOXX********?**  
 

Tecovirimat, sold under the brand name Tpoxx, is an antiviral with activity against orthopoxviruses such as smallpox and monkeypox. Oral tecovirimat is the same formulation that was approved by the FDA in July 2018 under the brand name TPOXX. upon approval, this will enable sales and marketing of oral tecovirimat in all EU member states, as well as Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. SIGA is targeting EMA approval for Q1 2022.

***19C*** Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (***BARDA) Contract***

 The company has entered in to multiple contracts over the years since the development of TPOXX with the DOD and Canada for the national stock piles of drugs. Including a recent one worth apox $112.5 million for the delivery of TPOXX.

Outlook for this company I think is great as they are expanding their market to different counties. They have no debt and recently entered in to a promotion agreement with Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc. (A Pfizer Company) for International Markets. I decided to spend yesterday calling around to see if people can get this vaccine. After different tried I decided to call up the dept of health. They indicated that according to the CDC guidelines that they follow nobody can get the shot unless they work with the virus itself. (pretty scary huh)

&amp;#x200B;

Bright outlook if nobody since the 70s has gotten the vaccine.

I will post the summary dot points below:

**Advanced Human Imaging Fundamental Analysis Report**

Summary of important points of AHI for those who dont want to read walls of text:

* AHI is a future tech unicorn still priced as a speculative company but already fundamentally at the stage of a high growth small cap company

* AHI has a business model of exponential growth in revenue earnings, with almost no additional operating costs as they increase in users

* AHIs tech offering is leading the way into digital health and consultation as the world embraces online technology and remote communication more and more

* AHI targets 4 verticals in the market with their tech offering, reducing risk and diversifying their revenue streams

* First vertical, Fitness, AHI has go-live partners Bearn already generating revenue, and partners Conor McGregor, Floyd Mayweather, Boditrax, Fitocracy to come next in the short term

* Second vertical, Life and Health Insurance, AHI has go-live partners Wellteq, Carevoice, Nuralogix, Wellkom and partners Nexus-Vita, MyDoc, TicTrac, Jayex Health to come next in the short term

* Third Vertical, Apparel, AHI has potential partners Nike, Zara, Uniqlo, UnderArmour, Levis, GAP, H&amp;M, Stitch Fix to come

* Fourth Vertical, Medical Health (mHealth), AHI has go-live partners Wellteq, Nuralogix already generating revenue, and partners Nexus-Vita, Boditrax, Jayex, TicTrac, MyDoc, Active8me to come next in the short term

* AHI expected to generate earnings between $100m AUD to $250m AUD by the end of 2022

* Current market cap of $160m AUD with fair value growth to become a $750m market cap company by the end of 2022

* Vlado is an incredibly charismatic, well-spoken CEO who has had over 30 years of experience in the fitness industry as well as business management, strategy and capital markets

* The AHI team has some very intelligent members and work with great synergy together to deliver outstanding results. It is due to Vlado and team that AHIs tech offering is unique in the world, with patents across multiple countries and regions protecting them from competitors

* NASDAQ IPO has them cashed up for the next two years with no exposure or debt

* AHI is on the brink of breaking even in revenue vs cost, and I expect a 300-400% ROI by the end of 2022. Exponential growth rate for AHIs business means exponential growth on the market

* Strong news flow to come in the short term with a price of $2 ASX price ($14 USD per ADR or $28 USD per unit) expected by end of the first quarter of 2022, with revenue streams starting to pick up steam by quarter 2 and 3.

* Vlado has managed to sign deals where the other company pays a guaranteed minimum fee to AHI regardless of how many users they actually manage to on-board. Absolutely unheard of for any other company on the ASX (Details under Deals that are pending go-live launch)

This is just basic research to properly understand the company, the tech and what they can offer and provide. There are of course risks as with investing in any company, and the bottom line for me is that they actually earn revenue close to the guidance provided. I believe 2022 will be a huge transformative year for them and am at the very least personally confident of them achieving $100M USD revenue by the end of 2022.

If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to answer to the best of my ability.

The CEO, Li Bin (William Li), is a intellectual and charismatic billionaire with good relations with the CCP.

NIO started selling cars to Norway this year and sales have been phenomenal. NIO will also begin deliveries to 4 other European countries in 2022. 

Overall sales and production have been good, especially considering these last two years have been rough for every car manufacturer. NIO has managed to not only produce but also expand.

NIO, like Tesla, isnt just a car company. They are an energy company, a battery company, a tech company. They will led China in the green revolution.

2020 Revenue: 2.9 bil

Profound Medical Group

A Canadian company that is revolutionizing cancer treatments by using real time magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. This incision free treatment will change the way the medical community treats various cancers including prostate cancer. The flagship product is the Tulsa-Pro and has received 510(k) authorization from the FDA. 

The stock skyrocketed and fell back to earth as delays hit the roll-out of the new treatments due to COVID supply chain shenanigans, but now Wall Street is excited about the roll out and it has buy ratings across the board (7-0!!!!!)

Lets look at our options:

Because this move to 2x could take 12 days or 12 months, lets take a conservative approach to maximize our opportunities for ROI. Looking at the 12 month option chain we see that $12.5 provides roughly 100% above normal stock appreciation projections where the $17.5 option provides max gains at higher risk.

With a price target 105% over current market value, this is going to rise, but because of over inflated market caps in other sectors, this could pop pretty quickly as investors take profit and rotate money.

 Aurora (Nasdaq: AUR) is delivering the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly mixed with EV technology. Founded in 2017 by experts in the self-driving industry, Aurora is revolutionizing transportation  making it safer, increasingly accessible, and more reliable and efficient than ever before. Its flagship product, the Aurora Driver, is a platform that brings together software, hardware, and data services, to autonomously operate passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles, and heavy-duty trucks. Aurora is partnered with industry leaders across the transportation ecosystem including Toyota, Uber, Volvo, FedEx, and PACCAR. Aurora tests its vehicles in the Bay Area, Pittsburgh, and Texas and has offices in those areas as well as in Bozeman, MT; Seattle, WA; Louisville, CO; and Wixom, MI.  

Who is backing $AUR

Aurora Innovations has the backing of major institutional investors including Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, Baillie Gifford, Sequoia, Uber, and Volvo, etc. Most of these institutions are physically locked up for 6months through their PIPE investment. This potential means it can break out before any institutions can get out. Most likely causing $AUR to have a buying frenzy 

Who is the team behind $AUR? 

They have a team made up of past directors and executives at top prestigious companies such as TESLA,GOOGLE,UBER,NIKE,AND ALOT MORE BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT LINK IS BART NABBE VP OF CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WHO WORKED FOR APPLE.

1,"11/19/2021, 19:47:17",SEC TAKES A BIG SWING FOR TRANSPARENCY,Germanicusss,Late Yesterday the SEC put out for comment a proposed rule that would blow the doors open for stock borrow transparency. The rule will require anyone lending a stock to immediately (w/i15 mins) report that transaction in its entirety to a new data repository at FINRA.

This is my third time trying to help the ape nation and try to come and join me on this small quest of getting $IO up.

&amp;#x200B;

So what $IO does? well, she is a tech company that help offshore energy creators (Mainly gas and oil) to save energy money and by doing so help the environment. they been recognized in the past as leading contributor to fight the clement change(WHOOO HOOOO)

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ion-recognized-role-reducing-ports-110000390.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ion-recognized-role-reducing-ports-110000390.html)

&amp;#x200B;

also, they beat their Q3 earnings. I say beat? I mean they demolish them! and those the value of the stock went 50% up.... from 1.53$ in the day they before to over 2.3$. but now its going down staidly to around 1.7 and even lower. why so?

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ion-geophysical-io-reports-q3-232511737.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ion-geophysical-io-reports-q3-232511737.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Well, mainly two things: 

1. over the counter deals - currently shitdael and others are ""trading"" between them after taking kind of strong short position (around 10% of freefloat give and take) and this lowering the value of this stock.

2. oil and gas is not cool anymore. not for us and many others, they do deal with this vector, but they trying at least to make it greener.

&amp;#x200B;

currently the barrowing fee for the stock is revolving around 20% showing that not just is heavily shorted but the amount of short stock left the barrow is between 0-100k

&amp;#x200B;

so why should we appes care? well the MOST important point is that there is only around 26M stocks overall and around 24M in the freefloat. so if we want to drive this stock to the moon is not something that we need to put alot of effort or money in. with 10$ you can get at least 6 stock. and if we corner this market we get to decide what the price will be!

&amp;#x200B;

meaning, its not a big hit to shitadel, i know, but instead of paying 5$ or even 10$ to this stock, why not 20? 50?!?!

&amp;#x200B;

we get to decide here and don't even need to go super all in on it, you can ""risk"" 10,50,100 bucks and you might can make a year worth of condoms for your wife boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm deep inside this stock and I believe in her, i got 17900 stocks at 1.24 as showing here

1,"11/19/2021, 18:19:47",$PLBY could be worth 5-10x with centrefold long term 2-3x short term.,Stonkgang_,"*Disclaimer: Im not a degenerate, I like to make money. This in my opinion is a great chance to do just that.

1. I trade for a living by picking stocks which look primed to breakout with a hold time of 2-5 days.

2. I also buy stocks whose business is on the cusp of a pivot point. A point in time where the business is likely to accelerate to new heights.

When this happens you can see a big run for weeks or months depending on how big the pivot is for the business.

$PLBY is on a pivot point and its Fucking huge. Its hard for me to express how big of a opportunity this is.

Now Im not going to bore you with a heavy DD as I know one was posted here yesterday so lets just talk centrefold. Playboys competitor to Only Fans.

Only Fans:

Currently has 120,000,000 member accounts and 1,000,000 creator accounts.

It brought in over $2.3b in revenue last year with a growth rate of over 500%

They earn money by taking a 20% cut of users profits.

How much do you think a company producing those revenues should be worth?

Incase youre unaware thats 10x the revenue of discord for 2020.

And its 4x $DKNG just as another comparison.

Those numbers and potential are not something to be slept on.

$PLBY -

Current valuation: $1.56
Share float: 17.63m
Revenue: 200m (approx)

If centre fold is a success then those numbers are about to 5-10x

The issue competing with a mammoth like Only Fans is getting your initial 1-2m member accounts and having content ready. You need the website to feel busy and you need content that people actually want to watch.

This is where 99% of social media start ups fail, nobody wants to join or be part of a dead site. Everybody wants to be where the noise and party is it. 

Can you seriously think of a better company to do this than Playboy? They have a reach of over 300,000,000 followers.

Incase youre unaware this number is fucking ridiculous. Its around 30% of the total accounts on Instagram. Which means that can reach 1 out of 3 people across the entirety of social media platforms.

Were talking Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.

Whats more is those influencers, most of whom are taking part in centrefold have a reason to fucking promote it. The have a reason to get their loyal following to sign up.

Money- everybody involved stands to make a considerable amount of money.

Playboy has announced that theyve had overwhelming demand from creators and we know they have a reach of over 300,000,000 for consumers so have no issues there.

Ive also dig deeper into these influencers and checked their engagement on posts. This took hours upon hours of trawling through playboy bunnies and celebs. I know no need to thank me its all for the greater good. 

The engagement is outrageously high, their engagement ratio varies but came out around 20%

Baring in mind a lot of people will see but not like their posts so their wife doesnt throw them down the stairs.

In my opinion the second this hits the App Store it will storm to top of the ranks and start trending.

Which means everybody is going to see it. EVERYBODY.

The press releases will hit and FOMO will get real.

Price target upgrades will come through as it trys to revalue a company thats just pivoted its business model. 

For the first time ever PLBY is actually making a move to compete in the 21st century and they have everything they need to do so.

If they are successful with centrefold and reach the same numbers or more of Only Fans their revenue and profit is expected to jump 1,000% +

Theyll also be valued as a tech company rather than a licensing and clothing company.

I feel a $10b valuation with $2-3b in revenue is cheap but nonetheless good value.

If this is the case the share price would likely exceed $230/share",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxdb8u/plby_could_be_worth_510x_with_centrefold_long/

**Potential Growth in Mobile**

I believe the stock is currently undervalued. The fact that Call of Duty mobile and King( Makers of Candy Crush) are doing well for them shows potential room for growth in other countries of the world. Their push into mobile by adding their triple A titles will enable new players from the rest of the world to access their games will enable revenue growth for them by use of micro-transactions. 

Their Q3 results show growth and though the sales for Call of Duty Vanguard may not be like previous C.O.D. games, their other divisions will allow for the pickup in revenue. Given that might move more of their games to mobile, this will enable them to get that sweet micro-transactions revenue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxd4jn/activision_is_a_buy/

Tilrays mission is to be the trusted partner for its patients and consumers by providing them with a cultivated experience and health and wellbeing through high-quality, differentiated brands and innovative products. A pioneer in cannabis research, cultivation, and distribution, Tilrays unprecedented production platform supports over 20 brands in over 20 countries, including comprehensive cannabis offerings, hemp-based foods, and alcoholic beverages. 

Tilray sells cannabis oil, dried whole flowers, vape pens and edibles in e.g. canada and sells medical cannabis in conjunction with  **Novartis**' Sandoz subsidiary worldwide in legal-medical markets. Tilray also focuses on cannabis research. Find out later on why that's important for the catalyst.

With 2100 employees lead by HAIN founder Erwin Simon, the following results for the first fiscal quarter were obtained:

 

&gt;Net revenue **increased 43% to $168 million** during the first quarter from $117 million in the prior year quarter  
&gt;  
&gt;International market leader and **#1 in Germany** with medical cannabis extracts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Net loss of $34.6 million during the first quarter compared to net loss of $21.7 million in the prior year quarter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Adjusted **EBITDA of $12.7 million** in the first quarter 2022**, 58% growth** compared to the prior year quarter, and the tenth consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA. If Adjusted EBITDA were normalized for Aphrias production costs, metric would have been closer to $17 million.

Considering their main income comes from cannabis retail stores in Canada which were closed until June, this is remarkably impressive.

Let's have a closer look at one specific market regarding the catalyst: **The European Union,** especially **Germany:**

[Tilray's EU portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/gedxswhwoi081.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f33a805b51becba9b12d320b0346af740a5930)

Tilray's cultivation space spans over 250000sqm in Canada, but also in Portugal.

While Tilray's products in the US and Canada are of recreational and medical character, their EU presence focuses on medical cannabis, research and strong cooperation with doctors and research institutes across the EU. This focus on **evidence-based medical cannabis production** makes sense not only because no single EU country legalized cannabis yet, but also because the EU medical regulations call for evidence-based medicine.

Tilray's making progress in the EU: 

&gt;NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2021-- Tilray, Inc. (**Tilray**) (NASDAQ | TSX: TLRY), a global pioneer in medical cannabis research, cultivation, production, and distribution, today announced it has been selected by the Luxembourg Ministry of Health as a supplier of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for the countrys medical cannabis program.  
&gt;  
&gt;Following this selection, Tilray will supply a variety of its pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis products, including extracts and dried flower with different degrees of THC and CBD for patients with varying medical conditions. These prescription-based medical cannabis products will be administered to qualifying patients in Luxembourg under the supervision of physicians.

..but also in Germany: 

&gt;On July 7, 2021, Tilray announced the completion and shipment of the first successful EU GMP-certified medical cannabis harvest grown in Germany for German distribution.

Tilray is recognizing the strong opportunity which poses itself in the EU, see: 

&gt; The European Union, which has nearly twice the population of the U.S. and where Tilray already has a very meaningful presence, represents a powerful growth market, and could potentially be a $1 billion business for the Company. 

If you made it this far, you can see the focus shift onto the EU of this bullish thesis very clearly. Here's why:

# The circumstances

&amp;#x200B;

[Legalized world population](https://preview.redd.it/c0vfyw63ri081.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=675f6ce8acf13bc4a9ec0679ba12a1a00087f8fa)

The amount of countries legalizing cannabis is growing strongly. As of today, 181.5 million citizens of this planet have legal access to recreational cannabis. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Blue: Legalized, Red: Illegal, Orange: Illegal but decriminalized](https://preview.redd.it/t26oxa2dri081.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=451ec663d6a63ee6477c75eb3ae3396d4afed8ef)

While medical use of cannabis is widespread, legal recreational use concentrates mainly on north america and south africa.

&amp;#x200B;

This graph from June 2021 goes to show that the global legal cannabis market is set for growth and this is not considering new countries legalizing recreational cannabis use. Well guess what, these numbers are about to skyrocket:

# The catalyst

&gt; Germanys likely next ruling coalition is closing in on a deal to legalize cannabis for recreational use, the strongest signal yet that long-awaited growth of Europes marijuana market is gaining traction.  
&gt;  
&gt;Negotiators for the Social Democrats, Greens and pro-business Free Democrats are hammering out the details, including conditions under which the sale and use of recreational cannabis would be allowed and regulated, according to people familiar with the talks, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.

Jep, right. EU's largest country by citizens will be legalizing cannabis in the next year. The new coalition, especially the Greens pushed for it during the last election and it will be reality soon. What that means is that the legalized world population will rise by **80 million, around 40%!** 

This week's Reuters survey stated that the cannabis legalization in Germany opens a market of $5.34 billion per year and creates 27,000 new jobs. 

Looks like the cirumstances are set for cannabis companies, but why do I choose Tilray?

# The ""thing""

Do you guys remember this dude?

&amp;#x200B;

[Joschka Fischer, \\""sneaker-minister\\""](https://preview.redd.it/6s730z63ti081.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aae71f657afb9a8e9352f70209e5c994fafadb56)

Right, that is former german foreign minister and vice-chancellor Joschka Fischer. Left-wing militant in his youth, later on the leading figure for the  German Greens. Fischer told media already in the 90's that he consumed cannabis with a positive outcome ( :D ). And it is this ex-politician who began advising large companies in 2008. Fischer was famously involved in the nabucco pipeline project and is known to have his late life financed by those big companies he advises.

Well, guess who is one of ten members of Tilray's 2018 foundes international advisory board?

&amp;#x200B;

**Joschka Fischer.** 

It's Joshi's party that will be back in the government after 2005 that is the legal factor in legalizing recreational cannabis. It might be possible that the federal department controlling the cannabis legalization process might go to the Greens. Favoritism is not seldomly heard of in Germany's politics. That's why I am really bullish on Tilray.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxctys/germanys_going_green_why_i_am_bullish_on_tlry/
1,"11/19/2021, 17:42:36",Confessions of an Ape,speedycmMIa,"Sup retards. I thought long about posting this for a while now, months, shit since June 10TH when these insidious bastards shot us down $82 on that eventful day. I am not even supposed to be here with you, but here we are. I was mining my own damn business in life when it all happened, sitting down at the office when I turned up the volume on CNBC when they were interviewing the Schill-Man over the phone, and how he pleaded to retail investors to sell their GME shares and go home; that you hit the grand slam and walk away he says. And then they turned off the buy button and promoted silver on the boards; that is when I joined this war; because it is a war; and make no deviation from that fact (Hedgies - How do you fucking dare to kill our 90s memories? You dumb fucks. Especially the Harvard educated idiot who is always bashing our beloved GME stock via CNBC with Muppet Andrew Sorkin and their media goonies who promote falsehood narrative against retail investors).

I read the DD, did my own fact finding; and educated myself about GME with DFV videos. Diversification went out the window when I found the subs; even parted with Tesla shares to buy GME YOLO (sorry papa Musk; I shall return), and when the Feb ascent started; 300 shares were in possession for battle. Then March 10 came; and I learned of their powers at 11am, something that will forever be ingrained in what we saw. The ability to orchestrate sophisticated coordinated attack against citizens of this nation, that was not normal for 23 minutes; certainly not something I want my daughter to experience when she is a woman of age. Nevertheless, we held the line; and over the next two months we traded sideways like always. However, in that spanning time; reading in the subs; I found a new friend. Say hello to my little friend; options you say.

Now I know why the system will simply implode, the leverage got me going; so much better 100:1 when it goes right. I sold my shares as the May ascend commenced and YOLO all into options play. The daily green gains for GME options were unreal, never seen monies in my life like that per day; but like smooth ape as I am; I slipped on the motherfucking banana and then some more. Fatal blow mistakes were made; first dont diamond hand GME contracts if you are up; your ability to execute sell options makes you money. Sell them. Diamond hand shares not option contracts. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Second mistake was purchasing July GME options contracts with high premiums during June peaks to double down for potential rocket; met with IV Crush/Theta after the bell closed; we had enlightening discussion about their jobs. Fuck me Charlie Brown. Those were catastrophic losses to bear. Third, was miscalculating their awesome powers to manipulate a stock for so long without legal repercussion from self-government itself. I thought maybe with 5 months left before options expired; that maybe one of the cycles will come rescue me from this abyss of depression.

So here I stand with you my brothers and sisters; wherever you are; for you are not alone for I am with you. Knowingly that no cycle will never come to rescue me from financial ruins, nor is this the end of me, but the start of a new chapter in my life. Where I want to engage in political conversation with elected leaders in the State and Federal level, to petition government to hear our grievances against Self-Regulatory Organizations who aid hedge funds in fraud through their deceptive deeds. Little did they know what power of a community beheld, to see information flow and to discuss arguments, work together to find the truth and share with our sentiments. That is what we labor in; this is what engrosses the energies of this community. The truth will set us free.

As I depart, I say onto you my comrade Sir or Madam, what is your loss porn? Show me For I know my duty in life; which is to forever HODL in your name; so, when the day comes to right all the wrongs, that you feast upon maintaining her good name.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxct4m/confessions_of_an_ape/

Im talking about the rat weve all seen in our wet dreams when they do not take place inside Chuck E. Cheese. Im taking about Mickey. And its time for Disney to revisit the moon.

The DD

As you may know, Disney shat its pants last earnings. The mouse and its bag holders, got satans dongus down their throats. Disney stock is sitting at the 150s and it has developed into an opportunity for all of us who saw the bad earnings coming to get into the Rocket.

Disney has existed for a while now and, though many of us have mixed feelings about the company, money and Disney have come to be synonymous. The company has acquired brands as ESPN, Star Wars, Marvel, and many other names which are recognized all across the globe. This is to Disneys advantage as it has many catalysts coming before next year to explode.

The Streaming side, Disney+, Hulu and Spidey

Guess what? Theres a new Star Wars series coming out. Star Wars fans love to jack off to new lore and as a Disney investor, were here for it. Remember baby Yoda? Well, probably new merchandise and cute characters to buy which means Ill get to sit in the sofa again with my wife and her boyfriend. Also the new Star Wars Starcruiser looks super cool and probably will attract lots of people who cant afford the vacation but go anyways. If this isnt bullish I dont know what is.

Also Disney+ subscribers are up and continuing an uptrend way ahead of schedule, in spite of post pandemic slowdown. New shows and movies came just after earnings including Entrelazados, Shang-Chi, the muppets and many nice shorts. But the best is yet to come with Hawkeye, The Beatle, Home Alone and of course, the Spidey movie, which will be a banger. Disney also owns Spidey merch which will blow up on Christmas.

Hulu is also up in subscribers by some millions and new series are coming and have banged like Only Murders in the Building. fuck Hulu though.

ESPN and sports

The mens NBA season is up (cause WNBA is irrelevant) and this is a constant winner for ESPN, with ratings soaring from last seasons and December being one of the months with the most viewership for basketball. Last year Christmas saw the highest number of viewers since 2012 and the uptrend is present at the start of this season. December 19 will see the G League winter Showcase and the Showcase Cup and December 27 will see the start of the regular season, with many sports journalists already calling out the rebound of TV viewership for the NBA, this is a great catalyst for Disney.

Another big catalyst comes next week, with NFL and thanksgiving coming up. The NFL is also seeing a rebound in viewership, up 9% from last year, and the thanksgiving event may attract investors as ESPN will be making a lot of cash from this date only. 

The online platform ESPN+ is also growing exponentially with 75% increase in subscribers year over year. Though some analysts do see ESPN as a liability for Disney, the sheer presence of the company in the sports platforms and current and future incentives may make it so cross platform growth is accelerated among all three Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. 

Im sure theres other sports stuff going on and news that will further grow Disneys dominance in the sector but I dont usually play with balls and sports are BORING hence why this section was BORING. But for you jocks and Chads please stop contacting my wife shes happily married and in a serious relationship.

Lastly, the real catalyst: The Meta

Everyone shouldve heard of these little JPEGs making millions, the new form of art, zoomers salary magnets. Non Familiar Toddlers (cant say it cause I get cockblocked but read the initials). Disney and many other companies have embraced the concept of virtual art. Disney released its first official Disney collection on November 6th.  Of course they sold out. According to my estimations, in the past 4 months Disney has made over $20 million in the sales of Non Familiar Toddlers, exploring this sector with Marvel first and now with other Disney and Pixar characters. The number is closer to $22 million if we count virtual unique comic sales. Disney made $7 million just last week when their Golden Moments collection debuted on Veve. Not only this, but they will be making recurring 6% in licensing fees each time the Non Familiar Toddler is sold. As you can expect there are already sales worth $10K, of which Disney will earn $600 each, on an open market where there are more than 100 thousand Non Familiar Toddlers just in this last collection. In total Disney published over 585 thousand Non Familiar Toddlers which are constantly sold in the secondary market and Disney gets a portion of each sale.

Before November, Disney had only published collections from their Marvel products. This Golden Moments collection is just a glance of some Disney figures. This is, undoubtedly, one of the companies largest roster of individual, recognizable, influential characters. With their ownership of many major franchises and characters which are pop culture icons, this is a billion dollar opportunity that the company will be exploding in the coming months, and investors will start to notice.

Finally, with Meta and their Metaverse proposal, we have seen companies as $RBLX run over 30 points for just saying theyll be involved in a meaningful way. It is just a matter of time for Disney to announce their participation in this new technology as well. With concepts from Virtual Parks to Virtual Sports arenas, Gaming, Apparel you get what I am saying. It is literally imposible for this company not to be involved in a major way.

Short TA

I was going to make TA as well but the post is very long already. just know seasonally the stock moves very well on these months, has a gap to fill ending at 173 and its sitting close to support at 155.58 after a small reversal yesterday. RSI on the daily says it is oversold at a tad lower than 30. The fast stoch is at 10. Literally screaming please buy me Sempai Ill make those tendies!

The End

Endgame is near fellow companions, Disney is low right now but for how long will it be? Most news sources are focused on the new Spider-Man movie or the new Star Wars hotel. There is more. Disney stock will enter parabolic territory after the news of Non Familiar Toddler sales catch on. Moreover sports are being relevant again and streaming services are pumping new shows and getting new customers at a very fast pace. Massive FOMO from both public and hedge funds when they see how much Disney can make with just images online. Fucking tendies for everyone after that.

As you may know, Disney shat its pants last earnings. The mouse and its bag holders, got satans dongus down their throats. Disney stock is sitting at the lower 150s and it has developed into an opportunity for all of us who saw the bad earnings coming to get into the Rocket as cheaply as possible.

Disney has existed for a while now and, though many of us have mixed feelings about the company, money and Disney have come to be synonymous. The company has acquired brands as ESPN, Star Wars, Marvel, and many other names which are recognized all across the globe. This is to Disneys advantage as it has many catalysts coming before next year to explode.

STREAMING: DISNEY+, ESPN AND HULU

Guess what? Theres a new Star Wars series coming out. Star Wars fans love to jack off to new lore and as a Disney investor, were here for it. Remember baby Yoda? Well, probably new merchandise and cute characters to buy which means Ill get to sit in the sofa again with my wife and her boyfriend. Also the new Star Wars Starcruiser looks super cool and probably will attract lots of people who cant afford the vacation but go anyways. If this isnt bullish I dont know what is.

Also Disney+ subscribers are up and continuing an uptrend way ahead of schedule, in spite of post pandemic slowdown. New shows and movies came just after earnings including Entrelazados, Shang-Chi, the muppets and many nice shorts. But the best is yet to come with Hawkeye, The Beatles and Home Alone and of course Spidey movie which will probably be amazing (Spidey merch is Disneys property so probably gonna make a lot from that too).

Hulu is also up in subscribers by some millions and new series are coming and have banged like Only Murders in the Building. fuck Hulu though.

ESPN AND SPORTS

The mens NBA season is up (cause WNBA is irrelevant) and  this is a constant winner for ESPN, with ratings soaring from last season and December being one of the months with the most viewership for basketball. Last year Christmas saw the highest number of viewers since 2012 and the uptrend is present at the start of this season. December 19 will see the G League winter Showcase and the Showcase Cup and December 27 will see the start of the regular season, with many sports journalists already calling out the rebound of TV viewership for the NBA, this is a great catalyst for Disney.

Another big catalyst comes next week, with NFL and thanksgiving coming up. The NFL is also seeing a rebound in viewership, up 9% from last year, and the thanksgiving event may attract investors as ESPN will be making a lot of cash from this. 

The online platform ESPN+ is also growing exponentially with 75% increase in subscribers year over year. Though some analysts do see ESPN as a liability for Disney, the sheer presence of the company in the sports sector, with the major platforms and current and future incentives, it will make it so cross platform growth is accelerated among all three Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. 

Im sure theres other sports stuff going on and news that will further grow Disneys dominance in the sector but I dont usually play with balls and sports are BORING hence why this section was BORING. But for you jocks and Chads please stop contacting my wife shes happily married and in a serious relationship.

LASTLY, THE REAL CATALYST: METAVERSE

Everyone shouldve heard of these little JPEGs making million dollar sales, the new form of art and zoomers salary magnets. NTFs baby. Disney and many other companies have embraced the concept of virtual art. Disney released its first official Disney NFT collection on November 6th.  Of course they sold out. According to my research, in the past 4 months Disney has made over $20 million in the sales of NFTs, exploring this sector first with Marvel products and now with other characters. The number of sales is closer to $22 million if we count virtual comic NFT sales. Now, Disney made $7 million just last week when their Golden Moments collection debuted on Veve, an NFT platform. Not only did the company made $7 millions in 6 days, but again they will be making recurring 6% profits in licensing fees each time an NFT is sold. As you can expect there are already sales worth $10K, of which Disney will earn $600 each, on a market of 100 thousand NFTs, just in this last collection. In total Disney has published around 585 thousand NFTs which are constantly being sold in the secondary market.

Before November, Disney had only published collections from their Marvel products. This Golden Moments collection is just a glance of some Disney figures. This is, undoubtedly, one of the companies with the largest rosters of individual, recognizable, influential characters and scenes. With ownership of many major franchises and characters which are pop culture icons, this is a billion dollar opportunity that the company will be exploding in the coming months, and investors will start to notice.

Finally, with Meta and their Metaverse proposal, we have seen companies as $RBLX run over 30 points for just saying theyll be involved in a way. With the exploration of NFTs, it is just a matter of time for Disney to announce their participation in this new technologys ecosystem. With concepts from Virtual Parks to Virtual Sports arenas, Gaming, Apparel you get what I am saying. It is literally imposible for this company not to be involved in a major way.

Short TA

I was going to make some technical analysis as well but the post is very long already. Seasonally the stock moves very well on these months especially December. It has a gap to fill ending at 173 and its sitting close to support at 155.58. RSI on the daily says it is oversold at a tad lower than 30. The fast stoch is at 10. Literally screaming please buy me I will get those trendies for you Sempai!

The End

Endgame is near fellow companions, Disney is low right now but for how long will it be? Most news sources are focused on the new Spider-Man movie or the new Star Wars hotel. There is more. Disney stock will enter parabolic territory after the news of NFT sales catch on. Moreover sports are being relevant again and streaming services are pumping new shows and getting new customers at a fast pace. Massive FOMO from both public and hedge funds when they see how much Disney can make with just images online. Fucking tendies for everyone after that.

Reposted from UWMCs board

I know what youre thinking. Oh FFS, why are you talking about this boring mortgage company again Yes its tanked HARD lately. But tonight, news broke that just got REALLY interesting.

# Background

UWMC has been trading sideways for months. Small float, boring company, shorts keeping it down. So the CEO made a change. He decided to sell 50 million of his shares to institutions, and in addition, agreed to an additional, large $100M sale of his shares, back to the company, using the authorized share buyback.

This was done to increase the float to over 10%, good for institutional buying and a possible S&amp;P 500 inclusion.

Shareholders were NOT happy, thinking he used the buyback to enrich himself.

[https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Announces-Launch-of-Secondary-Offering-and-Concurrent-Stock-Repurchase/default.aspx](https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Announces-Launch-of-Secondary-Offering-and-Concurrent-Stock-Repurchase/default.aspx)

Well the institutions ate it up. They got greedy, as they are known to do. They shorted the hell out of it. Share price went down 10% yesterday. Down another 7.2% today. The institutions wanted a HUGE discount on the offering, counting on covering later WITH THE SHARES FROM THE OFFERING.

https://preview.redd.it/xbklf972qh081.png?width=2384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=356146b61796fa624072e2b568e73199f8966ecd

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc)

That's right, 10.5M shares shorted in just two days, TEN TIMES the usual volume. That's 10% of the float shorted in the LAST TWO DAYS!

This is on top of the 10% short interest as of the end of October:

[https://www.ortex.com/symbol/NYSE/UWMC/short\_interest](https://www.ortex.com/symbol/NYSE/UWMC/short_interest)

I know what youre thinking, no its not a squeeze, why does everyone think everything is a squeeze?

If you've read this far, you may not be too dumb, so just hear me out.

# The Twist

Tonight, something VERY interesting happened. After market close, the CEO said the hell with this, Im not selling hundreds of millions of dollars to institutions at this pathetic price.""

Instead, HE'S ACCELERATING the $300M previously authorized share buyback:

[https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-Intent-to-Accelerate-Buyback-in-Public-Market-in-Lieu-of-Previously-Announced-Secondary-Offering-and-Concurrent-Stock-Repurchase/default.aspx](https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-Intent-to-Accelerate-Buyback-in-Public-Market-in-Lieu-of-Previously-Announced-Secondary-Offering-and-Concurrent-Stock-Repurchase/default.aspx)

HE PULLED THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM!!! Instead of selling millions of shares, HE'S BUYING THEM BACK!

How much?

UWMC has about $279M left on their buyback:

""Through September 30, 2021, total Class A shares repurchased by the Company of 2,742,617 for $21.0 million for an average price per share of $7.66""

[https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx](https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx)

At the after hours close of $6 per share, $279M is enough to buy back 46.5M shares, about 48% of the public float.

Considering 27% is held by institutions, there is only about 25% of the float left.

[https://www.nasdaq.com \[REMOVE\] /market-activity/stocks/uwmc/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/uwmc/institutional-holdings)

This sets up a legitimate squeeze. The stock is already up 8.7% after hours. **But it's not too late.**

# The Play

Shares, shares, shares. Buy premarket, or at the open. AND DON'T SELL.

Feeling lucky? Get short-dated calls near the money. Weeklies now available.

THIS COULD LAST WEEKS. UWMC is limited as to how much they can buy back on any given day (25% of the average daily volume).

Don't sell tomorrow. If you have to take profits, sell covered calls at your exit point.

Not financial advice.

# Positions

46,800 shares at $6.94

40,000 warrants at $0.98

# TL;DR

UWMC has a small float that's about to get tiny. Mat just whipped it out, lubed it up and placed it on the table. LFG!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxaq2h/uwmc_ready_to_pop/

 potential Apple Car partner is a company that Apple has already discussed acquiring: Canoo. 

 

Canoo is a novel EV maker that is, quite literally, reinventing the wheel when it comes to cars. The company has built a scalable, highly differentiated EV platform  dubbed a skateboard, by industry insiders  that has low floors, a wide base, and the markets first steer-to-wheel architecture. This platform maximizes interior cabin space of the car, turning a car from a transportation medium, to a loft on wheels. To that extent, many folks  including myself  see Canoos proprietary EV skateboard representing the future of cars in a self-driving society.

Apple clearly agrees.

To be sure, these talks have reportedly died down over the past year. But that doesnt mean they wont ramp back up again, as Apple gets more serious about launching the Apple Car and as Canoo demonstrates continued viability of its EV skateboard.

I think its fairly likely that, at some point in 2021/22, these two link-up for Apple Car production. It may not be an outright Apple acquisition. But a production partnership is likely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxagzd/potential_apple_car_partner/

I saw the headlines that Cathie Wood was dumping on Ford and GM for not having EVs already (more or less) and they don't have the ""DNA"".  I got curious and looked up some of their funds to see where they put their money.

I found ARKF, their FinTech fund and it's a whose who of FinTech losers this quarter.  Their largest holdings are SQ, COIN, Z, SHOP, TDOC, OPEN, ADYEN.  That's some seriously high potential bag holding there.  I don't know all these companies but I know that at least 5 of those aren't what I call great.  In fact, I have puts on some of them (tiny ones, just starting out).  It doesn't get much better with ARKK, ARKQ, ARKW.

Near as I can tell almost all of their funds rely on TSLA to do all the heavy lifting in the ETF.  If that's the case, who exactly does Cathie think is going to beat GM and Ford aside from TSLA when it comes to electric?  I can't find a meaningful position on any of their ETFs for any other companies in this sector.  In fact, if I had a bit more money and TSLA downtrends for any length of time, their ETFs would make great targets for puts.

\&gt;Who are 'Teamsters'?

The IBT (International Brotherhood of Teamsters) is the largest union in the nation. It started as a team driver's union in 1903 which evolved into a trucking union but now they have a large reach in many different sectors. The relevant part here is the (Package Division)\[[https://teamster.org/divisions/package-division/](https://teamster.org/divisions/package-division/)\], the largest division, and from the link we see two things. One, that UPS is the largest employer of IBT members, and two, that the IBT ""represents UPS package car drivers, air drivers, feeder drivers, part-time loaders, unloaders, sorters, clerks and mechanics.""

\&gt;What's this about a 2023 contract?

The IBT has a contract with UPS from 2018, which O'Brien (the new president) has criticized as not getting enough for members. UPS needs a new contract that goes into effect in 2023 which will be negotiated by O'Brien and his team. 

\&gt;Okay but how does this make me money?

The money comes from a shift of market sentiment towards the potential for hard fought negotiations and a strike. We've already seen a wave of strikes across the US with IATSE and UAW which recently concluded, and in a labor hungry market like we have now a strike would be more devastating than usual. That said I don't expect the strike to hit soon, I expect that would happen in early to mid 2022, but market sentiment may start shifting as soon as yesterday towards expecting stiff negotiations or a strike. On the other hand, union leaders may strike while the iron is hot, opting for sooner rather than later.

And there's historical precedent, (the IBT ran a UPS strike in 1997)\[[https://www.tdu.org/how\_the\_1997\_ups\_strike\_was\_won](https://www.tdu.org/how_the_1997_ups_strike_was_won)\] to great success. We are talking about an organization that has over a century of experience in labor negotiation and strike organizing; I sincerely believe a strike would be successful if its necessary, and it may be with O'Brien's big demands out of UPS, which include raising pay of part-time drivers from 14 and hour to 20, as well as abolishing their two-tiered payment system.

\&gt;Breaking the theory

Let's look at $DE as an example; contrary to what we might expect ALL of the drop in price takes place on the lead up to the strike announcement; if you shorted immediately before the announcement you lost money. But this most recent strike (seems to be the exception, not the rule)\[[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2524101](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2524101)\], as this study concludes ""in the prestrike period, however, the stock market consistently underestimates the cost of a strike to shareholders."" 

For right now I'm watching from the sidelines, but I would hop in with puts if $UPS goes a bit higher as that would signal to me that the market hasn't truly priced in the potential of a strike.

# Background

UWMC has been trading sideways for months. Small float, boring company, shorts keeping it down. So the CEO made a change. He decided to sell 50 million of his shares to institutions, and in addition, agreed to an additional, large $100M sale of his shares, back to the company, using the authorized share buyback.

This was done to increase the float to over 10%, good for institutional buying and a possible S&amp;P 500 inclusion.

Shareholders were NOT happy, thinking he used the buyback to enrich himself.

[https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Announces-Launch-of-Secondary-Offering-and-Concurrent-Stock-Repurchase/default.aspx](https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Announces-Launch-of-Secondary-Offering-and-Concurrent-Stock-Repurchase/default.aspx)

Well the institutions ate it up. They got greedy, as they are known to do. They shorted the hell out of it. Share price went down 10% yesterday. Down another 7.2% today. The institutions wanted a HUGE discount on the offering, counting on covering later WITH THE SHARES FROM THE OFFERING.

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc)

That's right, 10.5M shares shorted in just two days, TEN TIMES the usual volume. That's 10% of the float shorted in the LAST TWO DAYS!

This is on top of the 10% short interest as of the end of October:

Instead, HE'S ACCELERATING the $300M previously authorized share buyback:

HE PULLED THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM!!! Instead of selling millions of shares, HE'S BUYING THEM BACK!

How much?

UWMC has about $279M left on their buyback:

""Through September 30, 2021, total Class A shares repurchased by the Company of 2,742,617 for $21.0 million for an average price per share of $7.66""

At the after hours close of $6 per share, $279M is enough to buy back 46.5M shares, about 48% of the public float.

Considering 27% is held by institutions, there is only about 25% of the float left.

[https://www.nasdaq.com \[REMOVE\] /market-activity/stocks/uwmc/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/uwmc/institutional-holdings)

* WM Technology ($MAPS) is a **technology and software infrastructure provider to the cannabis industry**. The company is known for its **platform for consumers** which provides information regarding cannabis products, including online ordering, local retailer and brand listings, product discovery, and consumer education on cannabis. They have been **profitable** for the last 12 years.
* WM **also provides a suite of cloud-based SaaS and data solutions** for the cannabis industry.
   * The product suite includes point of sale, logistics, wholesale, and ordering solutions that enable clients to scale their businesses with the regulations applicable to the cannabis industry.

&amp;#x200B;

They went from $12 to $8.10 (11/18/21 closing price) after reporting their Q3 2021 earnings. The biggest reason MAPS fell after earnings was because of the soft Q4 guidance. The new full-year guidance for revenue is down to $190 million from $205 million in the previous quarter. Chris Beals (CEO) and Arden Lee (CFO) explained that the downturn was due to end-market challenges as consumer demand shifted to non-licensed channels. The non-licensed channels are able to shift their prices more quickly as supply and demand change. With the glut of supply in cannabis, many producers offloaded products to non-licensed sellers which harmed WM clients according to the company.

* Revenue for the third quarter was **in-line with expectations** coming in at $51 million, up 9% YoY on a reported basis and up 46% YoY in the U.S.
* **Monthly active users (MAU) grew 37% YoY**.
* Average monthly revenue per paying client rose 7% YoY and 18% YoY in the U.S.
* Gross profit for the quarter was $49 million (**96% margin**). - Yes you are seeing it correctly , they have **96% margin**
* **Adjusted EBITDA missed expectations** coming in at $10 million lower than the $13.5 million expected

**MAPS is likely trading at 5.6x sales and 5.83x forward gross profit , i**f the FY21 numbers are correct and the company hits their growth projections in the high-30s as stated by Arden Lee (CFO).

The average PT is $16.6 which is 100% upside. There has been lots of institutions buying into this stock in Q3 and they are currently holding 43M shares.

One of the institutions that caught my eye with their recent 13F filing was Senvest Management , they increased their positions by 263.786% from 1,584,975 to 5,765,912 shares.

If you don't remember , they are the ones who bought shit tons of GME shares back in September and sold at the top in Jan for $700M in profit. The only reason they tripled down on MAPS at $12.50-$15 is because it's undervalued for a growth stock and it's also why institutions keep buying.

TL:DR This is a cheap growth stock that has been beaten to $8 because of low volume. This is a great opportunity to accumulate , and it has 100%+ upside.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx7lkz/wm_technology_maps_weedmaps_dd/

The really scary thing is that a lot here aren't even trying to gamble in a semi-remotely intelligent way...

Let's just think of the equity market like poker.

Despite that it's gambling you can improve your chances if not do semi well practicing known and well established math..  The same goes for market analysis (To a point in these crazy market days).

But a lot of you are going all in over and over with 2-7 off suit thinking (Look at the price it's so low) or ""It just keeps falling it has to go back up.."" 

Come on guys... Practice some common sense here.

we are gonna get the standard troll comments and fuck it's what I love about this place but for real some of you have a problem and it's not a joke.

Fret not retards I am from the future and I have good news about Palantir!

The year is 2984, humanity is what the galactic citizens would consider a type III civilization. We harness the power of stars and effortlessly travel space and under the hood Palantir powers it all. You see the universe has a lot of data, some would even say it has an infinite amount of data and humanity has found the answer with Palantir. We are now able to feed the very fabric of the universe into an anti-matter super-computer and Palantir will give you answers, we know who created it how the universe was created and even how to alter the simulati.. err universe. 

Palantir has been the Operating System across the universe for the last 400 years. It now houses a sentient AI capable of exponential growth and capabilities on a near infinite basis- powered by Apollo. Currently Palantir is testing communication throughout the multiverse and data extraction of alternate realities. The main reality which you probably still call heaven or whatever has been implementing Palantir to help with the logistics of running all of reality. 

I should mention that Alex Karp is still alive, he transferred his consciousness into a chip which now walks around in an indestructible robotic body. 


Dont lose hope Palantards! The future of Palantir is so bright! 


Oh before I leave you you might want to know Palantirs price. Weve been hovering around $18 for the last couple of hundred years but the range is getting tighter than dick skin, its only a matter of time before we break out. Our outstanding shares sits at about 878 quintillion, Alex has a few more batches of options to exercise.

2,"11/19/2021, 09:58:14",Industry incumbents influence on the social media community and stock price movement for the leaders in the industry,kenzene,"I recently started investing in the market and started observing certain trends that are prevalent in the market. What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the brand names in the industry and the investor community for that industry in the market. For example, Apple, it has a strong following in the social media channels and usually positive sentiments on the social media channels about the stock results in a price increase. Today's chart - 

[Sentiment increase --\&gt; Price Increase](https://preview.redd.it/p0vfs32wkg081.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c6524b36b7ed90e313f4d50f3d38439e72c4bb4)

What you would notice in this chart is that at around 9 AM today the bullish sentiments for APPL started growing on the social channel and this was followed by a price increase a couple of hours later. I also noticed the news about them accelerating their autonomous car, so that contributed to the social chatter on these channels as well. I saw this trend usually in industries where there are established brand names, such as Automotive (TSLA, RIVN), Entertainment (AMC, GME) and Tech. Media (MSFT, FB etc.) 

But at the same time, industries such as Marijuana, Psychedelics etc. do not really follow this trend. As I try to understand why? one reason that I could think of is that these industries do not have a strong established incumbent and hence do not really have a strong social following. Which further leads me to think that these industries are just scratching the surface of their potential market cap. Another reason that comes to mind is the percentage of the shares that are held by institutions vs individuals. So, for companies and industries where we do not see a price movement following an uptick on social media, would it be safe to assume that most investors are institutions and not individuals. 

How do you all perceive the social media sentiments and their relation to the stock market for growing industry vs an establish industry? Sorry if the conclusions that I have drawn are very basic and not thorough, but I would appreciate a perspective or some direction to learn more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx5fw4/industry_incumbents_influence_on_the_social_media/

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* In a turbulent session ahead of Friday's options expiry, technology stocks powered the equity market to a record.
* The S&amp;P 500 reached its 66th all-time high, putting the benchmark index on track to set the second-highest number of annual records in history, trailing only 1995. The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 outperformed after global chipmaker Nvidia raised its outlook, while Apple surged after it was reported the corporation is accelerating the development of its electric automobile. Macy's Inc. and Kohl's Corp. led retail advances after indicating that consumer demand remains strong.
* According to Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, the S&amp;P 500 might reach 5,200 in the next six months in an environment of less monetary stimulus and outperformance by cyclical companies. That would imply an 11% gain from Wednesday's close.
* JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. economists said they now expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in September, becoming the latest on Wall Street to abandon a forecast for the Fed to remain on hold until 2022. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted a Fed rate hike in July last month. Morgan Stanley analysts believe officials will continue to hold steady on interest rates for the rest of the year.

and I suspect will add to Fords unit sales increase in months to come.
Cause: Ford eliminated low margin sedans, so their suppliers capacity was higher then the demand 
at the point of the sedan/demand cut. This coincided with the pandemic.
So when Ford production ramped back up Fords suppliers ( once the fire issue was resolved ) had excess capacity.

Analysis &amp; Conclusion: 
Ford grew sales at 26% in September and 12.1 % in October. With a projected 8% growth rate month to month for 10 months Ford will have tripled sales and revenue by August 2022 from August 2021. If this were to take place Ford stock would be worth well over $100.00 a share. Keep in mind the 26% growth in September and the 12.1 % in October is constrained by supply shortages. I used a conservative 8% projection to account for future potential supply constraints so I believe numbers are in the ballpark.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx4izo/ev_play_bullish_as_f_ford_llll_fords_chip_supply/

2,"11/19/2021, 06:41:02",Why hasnt former $Wish CFO sold any shares since July departure - is a deal done?,La_Loosh,"I was poking around Wish form 4s and thought it curious that Rajat Bahri apparently hasnt sold any part of his stake since exiting the company on July 23. For color, the stock price closed at $9.18 on his last day as CFO. Per the most recent F4 filed on his behalf on July 22, he last acquired shares through vested RSU conversion on July 15. (Link to Filing: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000120919121047859/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)

So, it would appear that this guy is content to go down with the ship - and with full knowledge that the Q2 ER would further tank the SP. That he hasnt sold his entire position is not so surprising - its that he doesnt appear to have sold any part of it. The only reasonable explanation I could come up with is that a deal somewhere north of $9.18 was already pending by team he left. Otherwise, why is this guy feeling so bulletproof - what makes him so sure hell recover massive paper losses hes incurred? I know theres been quite a bit of speculation as to potential buyout. Id never really subscribed to the notion as a likely near-term possibility, but now I do wonder.

Its clear that former officers and directors have some ongoing reporting obligations after departure. According to this interpretation, Bahris disclosure requirements would follow him for six months. https://www.thompsonhine.com/uploads/1152/doc/directorobligations2104.pdf

4,"11/19/2021, 06:39:28",I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To,Jodyhighrolex,"Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. For those that dont know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone! 

During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing theyre doing which Im sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.

Now let's talk about their evaluation

1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidias multiples are leading more than any other company. 
2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPUs. 
3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. Its definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidias $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.

If I have 250 shares of a stock (let's use $TSLA for this example). at $1000/share.  And today it's selling at $600/share.  I have enough Day Trade Buying Power to purchase an additional 250 shares at the low cost.  Can I buy that (so I would have 500 shares) and in the same day, sell the 250 shares of high cost ($1000/share)?

I don't think that would change much in my account, it would just bring my average considerably lower.  I know Wash Sales, I wouldn't be able to purchase more for a while, but that's okay.

I'm looking at bringing my average price down on a stock I have that's been going down for a while now and it's pretty close to bottom, without having to wait months for it to go back up again (which I'm praying it will).

Anything that I'm missing as to why this might not work or be a bad idea? (I don't day trade, so I have my few day trades available, not locked in).

1,"11/19/2021, 06:20:56",Gentex Corporation (GNTX) - Early Christmas Present,Lil_Rekt_Ridinghood,"Alright retards, listen up! I'm here to bring you an early Christmas present. It's comes in the form of an automotive technology company, and no I'm not here to pump the EV chubs. Gentex Corporation (GNTX). 

I'm talking about a company that has an 85% rally rate in the month of December. That means that 23 out of the last 27 years GNTX has seen a price rally in the last month of the year.

""What's the average rally?"", you ask. Well, for all years it has been 8%. In rally years it has an average growth of 10.93%. In falling years an average decline of -8.81%. With it's largest gain being a whopping 48.52% and it's biggest drop being -14.56%.

""So, what makes you so sure this is a rally year?"", you ask. GNTX has been on a rally since the end of October. Including running up to an all time high just recently. And the auto tech industry is in a run-up like never before. This specific technology is in high demand. But what's great about GNTX is that it's technology is expanding beyond the auto industry and into other areas, such as biometrics, and opening up new revenue streams. Plus the financial health of GNTX is so strong that it is able to survive any downturn in the US market currently. 

Even at close to an all time high GNTX is on sale right now at $37.29. Because by the end of December it will be significantly higher. I am expecting a growth greater than last year and will close out the year over $40.

""That's not enough growth for me to get my wife out of her boyfriend's bed!""

Well, retard, take a look at the options because I know that's the only thing you idiots do. 12/17 -  $37.50C finished down 17% today at $0.83 while $40C expiring on the same day finished up 1,400%. Needless to say, I already made my money, so no need to pump this stock. 

So call me Santa and go by your wife a new Tesla for Christmas so she can take her boyfriend out in style with all you hard earned casino money.

TLDR; GNTX options are about to explode even more before Christmas. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx17nb/gentex_corporation_gntx_early_christmas_present/

I started to notice weird price action on TLRY and an increase in Dark Pool activity recently, so I did a little digging and here's what I found:

Per their recent 13F filing, Citadel just added about $7,000,000 worth of shorts on top of their total short position on TLRY, an increase of over 20%! It looks like they tried to hide this by waiting to increase their short position until after the short interest reporting date so it wouldn't be reported/counted as part of the total amount shorted in this period since that number is only reported twice a month.

They obviously didn't want us to notice this so here you go. Kinda explains a lot on what is going on and the weird volatility on TLRY throughout the trading days recently and especially the recent increase of the amount of TLRY shares traded in the dark pools.

1,"11/19/2021, 05:59:03",Eff Tee Cee Vee - Etoros Time Is Now ,Absolute_Meat_Pie,"FTCV Fundamentals are growing and strong with $709 million in total commissions and $560 million in net trading income as of 1H21  both above their 2020 totals  and total commissions expected to reach $2.5 billion in 2025. eToros total commissions include commissions from trading activity, interest, and other charges. It generates majority of its revenues from trading commissions, which accounted for 87% of total commissions in 1H21. The net trading income is derived directly from total commissions after adjusting for trading cost. 

From 2016 to 2020, eToros total commissions increased tenfold, from $60 million in 2016 to $602 million in 2020, led by the increase in cryptoasset prices and trading volume in 2017 and 2018, the launch of zero commission stocks trading in 2019, and increased retail participation in equities market in 2020. Furthermore, as eToro expands, its proprietary technology, effective marketing activities, and ability to operate globally via a single platform (with adjustments per market), will enable it to grow its total commissions from $1.0 billion in 2021 to $2.5 billion in 2025; while profitability (EBITDA) is expected to jump ~46.6x to $700 million during the same time period.
eToros Total Commissions and Adj. EBITDA are Estimated to Near $2.5 Billion and $700 Billion in 2025, Respectively

In March 2021, eToro announced a definitive business combination agreement with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V (NASDAQ: FTCV) that values the company at ~$9.6 billion (pro forma EV). The transaction includes $250 million in gross proceeds from FinTech Vs cash in trust and $650 million in gross proceeds from a fully committed private placement in public equity (PIPE) at $10.00 per share from various strategic and institutional investors. These include ION Investment Group, Softbank Vision Fund 2, Third Point LLC, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, and Wellington Management, that will close concurrently with the business combination. The company is expected to have ~$800 million net cash on its balance sheet to support future growth. After the transaction, eToros existing equity holders, including current investors and employees of the firm, will remain the largest investors in the combined company retaining ~91% ownership. 

The company is expected to have an estimated implied equity value of ~$10.4 billion at closing. This reflects an implied EV of ~$9.6 billion for eToro, which equates to 9.7x 2022E net revenues of $990 million. This valuation multiple is significantly lower than its high-growth FinTech peers (26.2x), high-growth international brokers (17.0x), and developed tech led brokers (12.0x), making eToro an attractive choice for investors chasing growth at a reasonable valuation. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both eToro and Fintech V, is expected to close in 2021 and the combined entity will be listed on NASDAQ.

[$ATOS](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATOS) \*My Personal Opinion\* . Note: I am in ATOS since end of december 2020. First big event I whitnessed was the P2 trial of Endoxifen which was halted early because of 'overwhelming' results.... This is what I think happened next.  

1) Quay realized how fucking awesome the Endoxifen results are. (NEVER whitnessed a clinical trial of a cancer medicin which was halted early). At this moment he dreams of bringing Endoxifen to the market by themselves. -&gt; therefore they need a lot of capital (for building  infrastructure). 

2) This leads to Quay asking permission to add 325 million shares , which was rejected by the shareholders in May.  

3) Quay realized that the possibility of Atossa bringing Endoxifen to the market themselves, is impossible. 

4) Next plan: Partnership. Which means they need a big amount of shares for the partner to buy themselves in HEAVILY. I can imagine they allready had ongoing negotiations with some big pharma. 

 5) Permission to add 100 million shares : REJECTED. 

6) Partnership is no possibility anymore, which leaves just 1 other opportunity: BUY-OUT (probably forced by blackrock).  

7)The partner who they are negotiating with demands Quay to wait with updates, so the price per share doesn't go up. Which is very logical... Why? Imagine Pfizer who wants to pay 2,5 billion dollars to buy out Atossa (20$ PPS). If Quay brings out good news, the share price could go up till 15$ ... Would shareholders agree with a buyout of 20$ PPS at that moment? NO  ...  

8) Imagine the shareprice being 2,5$ (right now), who wouldn't agree with the 20$ Buy-out ? Everyone would agree...  

AGAIN, this is my opinion, or just for me the only possible reasonable explanation why we haven't heard from them in such a long time.

Which is more than the combined spending on print and digital books ($1.8 billion), movie tickets ($11.9 billion), video games ($31.5 billion), concert tickets ($10.4 billion) and sporting events ($17.7 billion) COMBINED. 

Spending on online gambling has been especially high as the pandemic added incentive for consumers to try methods of gambling that are not in-person. 

If you're looking to invest in online gambling I have an IPO coming to the CSE that you are going to want to watch out for. 

LottoKings is expected to start trading under the ticker $LKNG.C before this December. 

The company is already highly profitable with $LKNG making $5.6M in 2020. 

$LKNG 's portfolio includes Wintrillions, Trillionaire and LottoKings. WinTrillions and  LottoKings alone have had an average of 118K sign-ups per month.

Additionally, they have a tight share structure of only 60 M outstanding.

Any thoughts and Comments on this situation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwz7ov/lgvn_stock_manipulation/
1,"11/19/2021, 04:47:13","Stars, planets and literally rockets are aligning for a splitty split on 12/9",AlmightySnoo,"Most of this is going to be a rehash of Rob Graves' masterfully written autistic Twitter thread ([https://twitter.com/robgrav3s/status/1461111661310398469](https://twitter.com/robgrav3s/status/1461111661310398469)). Elon already hinted at the first stock-split way before the announcement using the exact same memery on Twitter and he's likely doing it again right now.

First of all, the Elon tweets in question:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rqc0x44r1f081.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75244ab6d82eaa21bb3542668861ea9c8c395253

As Rob pointed out, that ""129 orbital flights"" is just random and comes out of nowhere when interpreted as a milestone... unless you interpret it as a codified way to plant that 129 number in your heads.

Next you have this Elon tweet:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rath1n3s1f081.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e6f41b5d2c7710640b117696cc4a5ec4a3c96df

Again, the 12 looks completely random. But Gary Black then points to the fact that in the pic above you have exactly... 9 middle thrusters. And notice the time of the tweet? 4:20 (Central European Time). Yes, he's begging you to interpret it again as meme clues. So we got a 12/9 again. Liftoff could obviously be a hint to the stock mooning (*ie* a stock-split announcement).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs96q8at1f081.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20c3450865364f387de484817f6f96fd5cc109fe

Now here's where things get really wild. Assume that Elon is really hinting at 12/09/2021 as a ""liftoff"" date for $TSLA. Rob then suggests that the 934,091 amount of sales that appeared already 3 times is too specific to just be random. He takes 12/09/2021 and writes is as a number, ie 12092021, and then divides it by 934091. What does he get?

If you limit your self to only the 1st digit after the decimal, you get 12.9. Again, 12/9.

If you expand to 6 digits (what you'd get on an iPhone, given that's what Elon uses to tweet), you get 12.945228. If you sum the digits except 12.9, you get 4+5+2+2+8=21. Again, 12/9/21.

If you fully expand to 12.94522803452769, and do the same as previously, you're stuck with either doing this sum:

4+5+2+2+8+0+3+4+5+2+7+6+9

or:

4+5+2+2+80+3+4+5+2+7+6+9

But Rob then points out that Elon already hinted at zero being important:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wq0us9au1f081.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=074e7ba21017d6fffc610a2c0f8b2efd8910f71b

So we go with:

4+5+2+2+80+3+4+5+2+7+6+9=.... 129

Yes, 12/9 AGAIN.

Ok but what happens if we now sum all the digits and don't do this zero matters shit?

1+2+9+4+5+2+2+8+0+3+4+5+2+7+6+9=.... 69

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vnbucz9v1f081.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b632fa4f4a265696ac81845a22a606946901c38d

And now, to crown it all and conclude his autistic speculation, Rob remarks that Elon quoted the historian Will Durant. It does seem insignificant at first, but then you find that there is another Durant, William C. Durant, an auto industry pioneer, born in ... 12/9/1861.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lz9xr51w1f081.png?width=336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd5ef1d9fe51dd7b7236480e7ae336d158d43fb1

This is all you need to load up on calls with expiries after 12/9.

This would control the quality, prevent the distribution of contaminated substances and ensure the protection of minors.""

1,"11/19/2021, 04:13:06",The Definition of Retard or A Genius Ape Play - buying Astra Space before their first successful launch.,Hairy-Income4256,"Many eons ago, when it was still illegal on here to discuss SPACs, some beautiful fool posted something about some small space launch company called Astra. Thereafter I stumbled my way to learning more about the space launch industry and the main players. Im not going to bore you with a long elaborate story. I will say that when you look at all the launch companies, Astra has the strategy and business to make it stand out. Ill attach a link for you to read a bit more if you like. But in a nutshell they only expect to launch small to mid size rockets. What makes them stand out is theyve built their company with the core goal of being able to produce and launch rockets daily. They are going to mass produce them, and just the other month got approval for expansion of their property in the Bay Area to increase their production capacity. Not only will they be building more, faster than their competition, theyve built this business model to keep their costs at a small fraction of their competitors. They also built their launch systems to be shipped anywhere in the world, be set up with just a few people, and be ready for launch within a few days. Making them cheaper, launching on a more consistent basis, and more versatile when it comes to setup. 

The catch? They havent reached orbit yet. Last December they missed orbit by just a few seconds, and a couple months ago that attempt shit the bed. However it created the most GIF worthy Rocket launch out there. Thing literally tipped over and scooted sideways off the pad. Look that shit up its hilarious. Problem was a combustible fluid leak that shut off 1 of the engines via safeguards if Im correct. However the Rocket with limited engines still lifted off for a bit. 

In conclusion, theres ALOT of potential for this launch company to dominate its competitors. But it needs to reach orbit before it can deliver on all their promises. Their next launch is tonight at 11pm central( they launch out of Alaska)and all eyes are waiting for them to hit their mark. Ive got some long term positions but also short term to capitalize on a successful launch. When their SPAC was announced their price hit the low $20s. Were hopeful well get there with a successful launch but realistically Im thinking at least $15. Anyways, theyve done me well thus far on the short pops. Got my wife a boob job two months ago solely thanks to them finally going public via their SPAC merger. So that was and still is super awesome. And shit Bill Gates is even involved. So jump on the rocket ride tonight, when they reach orbit, or just talk shit. Just thought Id share as I felt this situation fits right in with all you degenerate gamblers and stock pickers alike. I discovered it here and maybe this will help out one of you other fugly degenerates. Best of luck fellow apes.

Alot of ITMS runs out tomorrow friday 19/11-21 ! Put pressure on shorts and even without squeez! Solid firm,Nebelong,"$PROG Investor Activism and Future Stock Price Potential

One only has to follow the money trail and management moves in order to figure out the direction of the company and its overall stock price. There's already a good amount of DD out there already over the past couple months on PROG, but the one that got me to start accumulating shares was one called[""The Short Story of PROG: How a Majority Shareholding Investment Firm is Shorting It's Own Company to Maximize Profits and How They May Be Stuck in a Short Squeeze.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/q45755/the_short_story_of_prog_how_a_majority/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I thought I would add my comments and thoughts. In my experience following activist investors and turnaround stories, I find that companies that have deep f\*cking value are ones that have been mismanaged as well as companies that have great founders but lack of corporate management or Wall Street experience. Biotech is quite the sector that contains many small companies and examples of this because most PhDs don't goto school to figure out how to manage their capital structure, and most Wall Street professionals just want an MBA to make as much money as possible and very few have the knowledge or quals to understand the science of drugs, vaccines and clinical trials other than what they read or see in the news.

**1. OWNERSHIP** \- First let's look at who own's PROG. For those of you who read ""The Short Story of PROG"" know that the now majority owner is a Hedge Fund called Athyrium Capital Management, run by Jeffery Ferrell. He is on the PROG Board as well used to run Life Sciences Investments at Lehman. He went to Harvard for Biochemistry. I like to call him / them an ""Activist Investor"" here for the purpose of this DD. Anyone who controls the 51% or majority of the company, makes the calls and directs the Board to make whatever decisions need to me made for the benefit of the shareholders, and in this case he/them.

[Top 20 Owners in PROG, ranked by position. Source: Bloomberg 10\/31\/21](https://preview.redd.it/b778lx7rbww71.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07abec17482c6c95401f79cf202cfa73ae994709)

**2. MANAGEMENT** \- Ok, so we followed the money trail. Since it's clear that one person/group OWNS the stock (unlike GME, AMC where everyone was trying to figure out share count, retail vs institutional, etc.) we know that we need to figure out the management moves to foresee what may happen next. [Eric d'Esparbes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericdesparbes) has been the CFO and if you look at his LinkedIn profile, he's a turnaround guy and has experience with Biotech firms ""dealing with complex shareholders and board issues"" as it states in his ""About"" section. He continues to say he has ""Capital raising to fund organic and M&amp;A driven growth and optimizing capital structures"". This is corporate and Wall Street lingo that basically says HE F\*CKS! Ok so let's check out his track record of ""success"" for real:

![img](40depxb2eww71 ""Side by Side comparison of Mr. Esparbes last company Innovia (another Biotech which partnered with big pharma GSK to make respiratory medicines) and his latest employer PROG. 
"")

Long time CEO &amp; Founder Dr. Styylli was asked to step aside, but continue as an advisor and is the #2 shareholder after Athyrium. Means the Doc still has skin in the game even though he doesn't know how to run a company or keep a stock price up. The sitting CFO gets the bump up to Interim CEO. Well timed with some new patents and paydown of debt allows the company to have a bit more financial flexibility.

**3. INVESTMENT THESIS** \- Ok, Pheobe's sum it up for me! I know most of you all are here for the Squeeze or the MOA$$. I've been in GME, AMC, BBIG and all the rest, so can tell you I've had my fair share of the Social Media swarming. I've seen numerous Ortex screenshots to know that this continues to be the #1 highest short interest stock on Ortex. If you have a look at history, this isn't a stock like Herbalife or Volvo where there is an activist investor trying to pull a short squeeze in order to blow out another whale. This isn't your GameStop, AMC, Macy's, American Airlines where its a bunch of hedgies looking to short the stock of companies beaten down by the pandemic. This in my opinion is a story similar to INVA and many other biotech stocks. It's a company with massive patent portfolio and partnerships with big pharmas. If any of you have watched ""Shark Tank"" you will recall that everytime someone comes up with a new product which thinks it deserves a massive valuation, the sharks always ask the same questions ""Do you have a patent?"" and ""How are you selling your product"". If the answer is ""Yes, I have a patent"" and ""I already have partnerships with big distributors"" you almost always are guaranteed a shark to make a juicy offer. So while I won't rule out the possibility of a near-term short squeeze or gamma squeeze, I believe the fundamentals of this company has room for the stock to make it back to it's glory days of when it first when IPO as we keep an eye on further developments in the near future. Look at the glide path of INVA from its bottom in late 2015. Obviously history is never guaranteed to repeat itself, and I'm not a financial advisor, but we could get back to $15 IPO price sooner than later if Mr. Ferrell and his team play their cards right.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwy4wj/prog_about_to_moon_alot_of_itms_runs_out_tomorrow/

1,"11/19/2021, 03:39:53",$SFT needs squeezing and more attention,davidgmontoya,"Shift Technologies (**$SFT**) is a stock besieged by short sellers and Im bringing this stock to your attention more out of moral outrage than out of concern for my own financial gain or losses. **$SFT is currently trading at all-time lows after an amazing earnings** and beating analyst expectations on metrics across the board and raising guidance. In this post I would like to present data that I believe makes this stock **an excellent short squeeze opportunity**, why it is **a good company** worth considering for the long-term, while hinting at my seething rage toward short sellers. 

**SHORT SELLING INFO**

Its hard to find up to date short information so I am going to provide from a few sources. Most of this data is from October 29 but I believe that short-selling of this stock has increased beyond the information available.

Market Beat: **12.94 million shares short**, **percentage** of shares sold short **22.4%**, **days to cover 8.7**

NASDAQ: **9.1 days to cover**

Yahoo Finance: 12.94 million, **short % of float 20.33%**, **short % of shares outstanding 15.37%** 

Ortex: **15.88 million shares on loan**

I dont fully understand how dark pools affect stock prices **but dark pool short ratio** on $SFT stock is **50.83 percent**. 

*These are the apex predators of Wall Street. They are in the business of shorting companies to destroy them. \[...\] That is their business model. And they are not academic traders \[...\] who are just speculating on outcome: they engineer the outcome.* \-- David Sacks

The **RSI** on $SFT indicates that it is **incredibly oversold.** $SFT is not highly publicized enough to come up with the volume to combat the surge of short selling and it has provided an easy target for predators profiting off a business with tremendous long-term potential that will be adversely affected by these sorts of attacks.

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Here is a boring description of $SFT from Yahoo Finance and some additional information provided from official SEC filings and their investor relations page, as well as some information about earnings:

*Shift Technologies, Inc. provides end-to-end auto ecommerce platform for buying and selling of used cars. The company operates through two segments, Retail and Wholesale. It engages in the retail sale of used vehicles through its platform that enables mobile digital transaction, such as car searching, scheduling an on-demand test drive, and purchasing at home or at the preferred site of a test drive, as well as provides financing and services. The company also provides value added products, such as vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection waiver coverage, prepaid maintenance plans, and appearance protection plan. In addition, it is involved in the sale of used vehicles through wholesale auctions or directly to a wholesaler. The company was founded in 2013 and is based in San Francisco, California.*

**EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS &amp; SUCH**

In **Q3 2021** $SFT achieved year-over-year **revenue growth of 200%** and year-over-year **growth on units sold levels of 100%**.

Their **Total Gross profit** of 13 million was an **increase of 248%** year-over-year and they are **projecting midpoint guidance of 151%** year-over-year **Q4 revenue growth**. 

Management recently raised their **full-year estimates of revenue to $621 - $629 million**. (Despite this, $SFTs current market cap sits at only 452.38 million.)

Although Cost of Operations is increasing, profit margins are also increasing.

The valuation is less than Vroom or Carvana despite stronger growth.

**COUNTERARGUMENTS TO CRITICISMS OF SHIFT:**

Some critics say that Shift is a knockoff of Carvana and while it provides a similar service, their target demographics are different and they focus on parts of the market that Carvana does not. Shift focuses on vehicles older than 4 years old and more affordable vehicles.

While Shift has a lower customer satisfaction score than Carvana, its customer satisfaction is 18 points higher than Vroom.

Everyone should do their own DD on $SFT but I believe this stock warrants more attention. I own $SFT and am currently adding to my position. This post contains forward looking statements. There are risks in investing and/or trading stocks.There are statements in this post that reflect my own personal opinion.

*  Revenue increased to $35.8 million, up 484% year-over-year 
*  Cryptocurrency Mining revenue increased to $31.2 million, up 924% year-over-year.
*  Adjusted EBITDA of $21.2 million, compared to $0.8 million in the prior year 
* Cash, short term investments and coin holdings of $53.0 million as of September 30, 2021 and approximately $105 million as of November 14, 2021

and if thats not enough:

 (Greenidge) today announced it has been selected by Bitmain as one of five global launch customers for Bitmains newly announced ANTMINER S19 XP. The S19 XP technology requires approximately 27% less electricity per terahash than the most efficient mining equipment currently available in the market. - The cost per coin will be very low for them. -

It makes no sense at all for its current price of 21$. so big possibility of 

the only thing holding this back is their air permit renewal, some grasshopers trying to get it canceled due to polution but have yet to prove that their polluting more than their permit allows.

I mean Mara uses Coal for god sakes.

With the sale of non-core assets, VIAC is gearing up to enter explosive growth mode in 2022.  From recent news, we can see that Viacom is dumping non-core assets to fuel growth:

1. Black Rock Building - $760M sale with Q4 close ($523M gain expected to occur in Q4)
2. CBS Studio Center - $1.8B sale with deal expected to close soon (should be a huge gain given that total P&amp;E for VIAC is only $1.8B)
3. Simon and Schuster - $2.175B - this one is not a lock due to the recent movement by Dept of Justice.  Worst case, the business continues to print money for VIAC ($173M pre-tax YTD income) and VIAC collects a nice termination fee related to the transaction.

On top of the huge cash influx outlined above, VIAC has $4.8B in cash on hand at 9/30/21, an untapped $3.5B revolving credit line, and the business prints money (1.6B YTD operating cash flow  despite the large uptick in programming inventory).

US inventories have drawn down 30% over the last 12 months, left with around 2.5 years of inventory. Given the long lead time required for uranium delivery, utilities historically do not let their inventories fall below the 2-3 year coverage level. Utilities may need to start entering the market to secure more uranium.

\- At the same time, in response to lower prices, uranium producers began cutting capacity over the past several years. Most recently, these cuts have been accelerated by the recent coronavirus pandemic

Over the last few years electric vehicles have really been taking off in terms of the amount of models available and overall utility with companies like Canoo (GOEV) and Workhorse (WKHS) building trucks and other more practical alternatives to the traditional passenger focused setup. Recently Ive seen the development of solar-assisted EVs come into the mix. These cars use photovoltaic cells on their body panels to capture solar radiation and convert it to usable electricity with the objective of increasing the overall carbon efficiency of the vehicle. On paper this sounds like a good idea as essentially all electric vehicles are gas powered as the electricity they use to charge themselves primarily comes from fossil fuel burning power plants thus enabling the car to produce its own power would cut down on this dirty power usage. Two companies that catch my eye are Sono Motors (SEV) and Aptera Motors who is not yet publicly traded (ipo phase). Sonos flagship car, the Sion is a very practical vehicle whos aesthetic is something conceived by the mating of a Ford C-Max, a Tesla Model 3, and a Honda Fit. Apteras flagship car is the Paradigm which looks like a landspeeder you would find in Star Wars and boasts a 1k mile range on its battery.

What I Think 

In general, affordable electric vehicles will be the norm in urban centers across the world. Particularly in major countries like the United States. However when it comes to solar-assisted EVs I think their utility falls behind in comparison to their non solar competitors. Many factors play into the practicality of a solar powered car such as the angle of the sun, cloud conditions, air pollution, building density and the list goes on. If someone was using one of these vehicles in an urban environment it would be almost impossible to use the vehicles solar capability to charge the car due to it being in the shadow of tall buildings or within a parking garage. With that being the case why would someone in a city or suburban area purchase one of these cars over for instance a Tesla Model 3, or a Honda Accord Hybrid? 

How All of This Relates to Stonks 

Were in a period where it seems like everyone from the Federal Government to Wall St is going googly-eyed over EV stocks in general. Sono Motors released its IPO yesterday and is up 115% since the time of this writing. What is causing all of this growth? Is it all based on hype, fear and greed due to the media of increased electrification of the automotive industry? Or is there some actual substance particularly in solar-assisted EVs that Im just not seeing?

TLDR:

- Markets are confused in evaluating EV companies 

- Government looks good by promoting EV legislation

- EV stocks are super volatile due to confused market

- Options can be nice or really mean due to said volatility

- Are solar assisted EVs actually worthy of all the hype?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwwflf/sono_motors_and_aptera_motors_what_is_the_deal/

Monday (11/15) after hours Tony Aquila (CEO) announces that Canoo will be accelerating US production from its orginal Q1 2023 to ""before Q4 2022"". I was sent a Bloomberg article written by Mark Gurman [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle) mentioning that Apple is also accelerating work on their car.

The apple car's discussions seem to be moving in the direction of something similar to Canoo's models, how the seating should be ""along the sides of the vehicle"" and have an exterior design like the Canoo Lifestyle vehicle. 

Canoo has the Multi Purpose Platform, the flattest skateboard design as of now. This platform is designed in a way to carry any type of ""tophat"", this the way Canoo is decreasing it's engineering costs and how they are going to be launching 3 different vehicles  (possibly a forth, pictures of a sedan/sport vehicle were leaked) in 3 different segments. 

Here is the speculation: Tony Aquila has made a huge point of protecting IP, part of the reason why the engineering services deal with Hyundai was terminated. They made sure to poach top notch IP lawyer from Harley Davidson to protect it and sidelined VDL Nedcar (their contract manufacturer in Europe) over a hacking attack they recently had. Why would you be so hell bent on protecting IP unless you are going to be licensing it out to other companies (also for corporate espionage, but I'm not sure how often that happens). If they do license the MPP, Apple would only have to focus on what they do best, the design and the user interface and based on the patents Apple has been focusing more on those types of tasks. For example, Apple is exploring the potential of using a phone as the car's infotainment, Canoo has been on board with this concept since its inception.

Just like bit coin mining companies values are directly correlated with the price of bit coin, uranium mining companies value is directly correlated with the spot price of uranium which has been on a tear reaching new highs YTD and is projected to double in price in the next few months.

**Macro Catalysts - Uranium Sector**

* Uranium sector sentiment turning increasingly positive. The global narrative has clearly shifted as it becomes abundantly clear that nuclear power has a critically important and growing role to play in the energy mix of the future especially as the clean energy push accelerates.
* The recent UN Climate Summit (COP26) reinforces global pressure to invest more aggressively into green energy.
* The United States, Russia, China, and France now describe the once-neglected technology as a key part of their decarbonization plans and expected to invest heavily, billions, into nuclear energy.
* Previous uranium cycle peak of $150 in 2007; currently uranium has rallied to $45 from a post-Fukushima low of $20 with more fundamental catalysts
* Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) launched and has \~$1.95 B of capital and buying power specifically for uranium, and more capital being raised

&amp;#x200B;

**Primary Catalyst:** Supply Squeeze

Supply and demand imbalance causing spot uranium price spike, which will heavily increase miner revenue. Since miners employ operational leverage to mine Uranium, miners are leveraged bets on the uranium sector

**\[Demand\]**

* Currently, 442 nuclear reactors operate in 30 countries, consuming 200 million pounds of uranium per year. Over 50 reactors under construction and an additional 321 reactors proposed:  

   * China to build more than 150 reactors by 2035
   * Russia 51 reactors
   * India 49 reactors
   * Saudi Arabia 16 reactors
   * US Infrastructure bill to spend US $6T for new nuclear power
   * Japan restart of at least 30 reactors needed
* Sprott Physical Uranium Trust has accumulated about 6m pounds of physical uranium since it began trading on July 19
* Uranium demand is projected to rise from 162m pounds in 2021 to 206m pounds in 2030, then to 292m pounds in 2040

**\[Supply\]**

* The supply deficit is currently 20 million pounds and could reach as much as 50 million pounds as mine production has been suspended due to COVID-19

\- Utilities have been underbuying uranium since 2014, this deficit has been filled by the drawdown of existing inventories. US inventories have drawn down 30% over the last 12 months, left with around 2.5 years of inventory. Given the long lead time required for uranium delivery, utilities historically do not let their inventories fall below the 2-3 year coverage level. Utilities may need to start entering the market to secure more uranium.

\- At the same time, in response to lower prices, uranium producers began cutting capacity over the past several years. Most recently, these cuts have been accelerated by the recent coronavirus pandemic

**Fundamental Analysis:**

* $3.75 PT by Cantor Fitzgerald based on a 1.5x multiple on the companys Athabasca Basin uranium projects and 1.0x NPV on its net financial position (cash, investments, and Uranium in inventory)
* Recently sold half of the equity stake in GoviEx for C$15.6MM in cash upfront and up to C$41.6MM in total consideration if the warrants are exercised in full. GXU shares up 104% YTD.
* **Cash and Uranium inventory: C$220MM**
* **Market Cap: 1.4Bn**
* Successful 2021 in-situ recovery field test program at the Phoenix deposit at its 95% owned Wheeler River Uranium Project. Successful field test provides further proof of concept on the amenability of the high-grade Phoenix deposit to the In-Situ Recovery extraction method. Delivered on multiple de-risking milestones. De-risking work at Wheeler River regarding the In-Situ Recovery mining approach to the ultra-high-grade Phoenix deposit is underappreciated by the market. Denison has made significant positive technical progress in the field in 2021 along with very positive drill results which are expected to lead to more uranium actually recovered from Phoenix. In-Situ Recovery technique will result in an extremely low production cost profile.

**Bullish market structure:** higher lows, higher highs for price and RSI. Recent Inverse Head and Shoulder break could indicate an imminent run

**Risks:**

* Commodity miners are at high risk due to their operational leverage and reliance on volatile commodity prices for revenue.

While this is kind of silly and a bit absurd (though it did happen!), I think its worth examining and explaining how the incentives for a self-regulatory, for-profit company lead to extreme complexity and subsidization in US markets. Its easy to say self-regulatory BAD! but harder to understand the web of complexity that such perverse structures create.

This is a long post. By the end, I hope you understand what the self-regulatory structure is, why it exists, why it creates perverse incentives, and how I think it should be fixed. Ill do my best to explain the context of these archaic structure, why it leads to unnecessary complexity, and reduces competitive forces. Most importantly, throughout the piece think about how such perverse incentives leads to lax enforcement and wrist slaps, and a cozy relationship with the industry being regulated.

https://preview.redd.it/asptyy6fee081.jpg?width=1181&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42c3f67a1d69026018d8a83d47d119cdd7385e2d

The financial services industry is the only industry in America (that I am aware of) in which for-profit, publicly traded firms are self-regulatory. What does self-regulatory mean and where did it come from? The structure came about from the member-owned stock exchanges that existed prior to 1934. In 1934 these exchanges were brought into partnership with federal regulators in the Exchange Act of 1934. This actually made a lot of sense. There was nobody better positioned to monitor and enforce the rules of a stock exchange (where trading happened in a physical location, on the floor of the exchange) than the exchange itself. There were conflicts-of-interest, of course, but there were also practical considerations of what technology and communication systems looked like in the early 1900s.

So what does self-regulatory mean? Now of course, Im no lawyer, so take everything I say with that in mind. Essentially the self-regulatory structure gives the regulation arm of the exchange quasi-governmental powers (its been explained to me that this structure means the exchange is supposed to act as an extension of the SEC)  and gives the exchange itself immunity from prosecution when carrying out regulatory functions. It basically means that US exchanges set the rules for trading in US markets, and for interacting with their business, are then in charge of enforcing those rules and have no legal liability in the operation of that business. Those rules include things like fee structure, order types, matching priority model, co-location and data feed costs, and many other things.

That means each for-profit exchange is setting its own rules, and responsible for enforcing those rules. Each exchange is responsible for monitoring its own market for manipulation (called market surveillance). In reality, the responsibility for market surveillance is outsourced to FINRA. FINRA is another SRO  they are not a for-profit exchange, but they are responsible for setting the rules and policing broker/dealers. 

FINRA, DTCC and others are not for-profit, of course, but they are deeply conflicted. They operate on the fees generated by their members, who they police and regulate; stock exchanges do too  their best customers are high-speed speculators (aka HFT), who submit 95% of all orders, and are a party to \~90% of all trades. These speculators also pay for expensive, proprietary data feeds, high-speed connections and cross-connects, and other exchange services. SROs are supposed to police these customers, and are charged with ensuring that their best customers follow the rules. 

*Gee Dave, that sounds like a conflict-of-interest! At least its not for anything important, like the foundation of the US economy, right?*

It is generally the SROs that have made breaking the rules a cost of doing business (naturally following the lead of the SEC, of course). While they dont have the authority to press criminal charges (again, not a lawyer) they could easily make referrals and work with the DOJ, who does have that authority. Instead, nearly all of Wall St has decided that breaking the rules is nearly always only worth a fine, very rarely an industry ban, and practically never a perp walk and prison.

Just like nobody lost their banking license for fraud following the Great Financial Crisis, can you remember a time when a major broker/dealer had their license revoked? Robinhood has been fined well over $100M by FINRA and the SEC for lying to their customers, failing to provide best execution, and underinvesting in compliance, technology and any system for protecting their customers. For some reason, none of this was enough to lose their license to operate. Those guys are laughing all the way to the bank. Fine after fine is charged to every broker on Wall St, paid by the shareholders, and everyone keeps collecting their bonuses. 

**First SRO Problem: Reluctance to exact severe consequences because the fees being collected from the perps are paying for SRO operations and bonuses.**

However, theres another side to all of this. Lets take a concrete example to start. In 2014, BATS and DirectEdge merged. Together, they represented approximately 20% of trading in the US. Each of them operated 2 copycat exchanges  a maker/taker exchange (BZX and EDGX) and an inverted exchange (BYX and EDGA). In any other industry, such a merger would result in the consolidation of these exchanges so that the resulting company would only operate 2 exchanges. But that didnt happen here. They continued to run 4 exchanges and do to this day. Why would they do that when it costs way more to run 4 exchanges rather than 2? The answer is actually quite simple and obvious  money. To understand why, we have to take a quick step back, and reference another law.

The 1975 Amendments to the 1934 Exchange Act established the need (and gave the SEC the authority) to create the Securities Information Processor (SIP). It was groundbreaking at the time. The SIP is the ticker  a record of quotes and trades on all national securities exchanges. Ultimately the SEC did NOT create such a system though, it delegated the authority to the exchanges. The exchanges created the NMS Committees, which are responsible for managing the SIP and setting fees. From last years SEC press release announcing changes to the SIP:

https://preview.redd.it/keanllaiee081.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2c534963b0e2fcd94f7d70d9d92857bc00e2a2

**ALRIGHT ENOUGH HISTORY DAVE, WTF IS THE SIP??**

Sorry, its hard to talk about this stuff without getting deep in the weeds. The SIP is generally referred to as the public data feed  at the moment (though this is changing), it provides top-of-book quotes across all US exchanges, calculates the NBBO and publishes it, communicates regulatory halts and other information, and publishes all trades both on- and off-exchange. 

**And guess what? You pay for it.**

Thats right  you are paying for the SIP. Nearly every retail broker subscribes to the SIP, and generally speaking when you see the prices that a stock is being quoted at, or trading for, youre seeing SIP data. This public data feed costs $4 per user, per month, for non-professional, display-only users  if youre not a financial professional, and youre only seeing the data with your eyes (rather than programming a trading system that will automatically look at the data), then you are a non-professional, display-only user.

What are all of those user fees worth? Something on the order of &gt; $300M per year. That money is collected by the operators of the SIP (NYSE and Nasdaq), and distributed according to a very complicated formula to each of the exchanges. On the whole, it gets divided up based on quoting and trading market share, and means that approximately $100M every year goes to CBOE, NYSE and Nasdaq (with much less going to the smaller exchanges). Thats why BATS/DirectEdge (and now CBOE, which acquired them in 2016) was incentivized to continue to operate 4 exchanges, because it meant that more of this public subsidy would go to them. Talk about perverse  its the exact opposite of what the 1934 Exchange Act was established to do:

https://preview.redd.it/56zjmu5jee081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=605f5d20f09c747106b5b820154f1c47f5e458fc

It gets even worse (No way Dave! How can it be worse than this??). Each exchange sells private data feeds that are faster and contain more information than the SIP. So the exchanges are incentivized to ensure that the SIP remains slow, and has less data, so they can make more money selling their private feeds. Pretty sweet gig if you can get it, right?

Now, Ive simplified the issue, of course. It gets even more complex with Reg NMS and order protection, which requires all exchanges to connect and route to one another, and brokers to manage that complexity as well. It means that CBOE gets double the revenue for private market data, and other connectivity fees, all of which ensures that CBOE earnings per share are robust and growing, and which accomplishes the opposite of the intention of the 1934 Act.

**Second SRO Problem: SRO structure is a classic example of regulation and subsidy creating inefficient and costly complexity.**

The BATS/DirectEdge example is only one of so many that highlight the unnecessary complexity at the heart of US markets. Ive talked many times about the need for regulators to understand complex systems and systems theory, to understand evolving regulatory structures in that context, and to focus on simplifying markets rather than making them more complex. Unnecessary complexity leads to several problems:

1. Opacity  it becomes very difficult to understand these complex systems. That leads to mistrust, and potentially loss of confidence. We are seeing that play out right now in the retail community, and for good reason. Nobody trusts Wall St.

2. Fragility  unnecessary complexity can lead to fragility. For example, the segmentation in US markets that diverts retail order flow to the duopoly of Citadel and Virtu leaves exchanges as toxic cesspools that discourage market making. This both widens spreads and reduces market making diversity, leading to behavior that can result in illiquidity contagions (mini flash crashes).

3. Rent Seeking and Concentration  unnecessary complexity incentivizes a select few firms to master the complexity. This puts them in a privileged position, and creates economies of scale where the more of the market they master and control, the more information they have that others dont, and the more theyre able to master and control. They push SROs to create ever more complexity to maintain their incumbent position, and are able to extract rents as a result. The SROs listen to these firms because they are responsible for more and more trading activity, which means they are the SROs best customers. Instead of SROs following their duties under the 1934 Act, they act in the interests of their shareholders to maximize revenue. This cycle continues unabated.

**Third SRO Problem: Unnecessary complexity makes markets opaque, fragile and leads to a feedback loop of rent seeking and concentration of power. The for-profit motive overrides the SROs duty to create fair and efficient markets.**

I mentioned before that SROs have legal immunity. This means many things, but primarily it means that the brokers who are members of the exchange dont have legal recourse when something goes wrong. It is for this reason that retail brokers who dont accept PFOF still route to the off-exchange duopoly of Citadel and Virtu, because they want someones neck to wring when something goes wrong. The legal immunity that exchanges enjoy is one of the reasons that we have dramatically segmented markets.

**Fourth SRO Problem: Legal immunity for for-profit, publicly traded companies leads to perverse incentives and terrible outcomes.**

So whats the result? A huge amount of unnecessary complexity, enforcement becoming a cost of doing business, and ultimately fragile markets with low participant diversity delivering poor outcomes for investors as the for-profit SROs focus on creating churn and volume to increase earnings per share. 

More complexity means more fragmentation. More fragmentation means more complex order types. More fragmentation and complex order types means more unnecessary trading and churn. More unnecessary trading and churn means more earnings for publicly traded SROs. Rinse and repeat. It ultimately means that we end up with so much complexity that its impossible to keep track of. Take a look at the results of this 2018 RBC study on exchange fee structure:

https://preview.redd.it/pw5d8zyjee081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae29f2fb4851f91c209597e1fff0adab28c445c5

If someone can explain how this fee structure promotes just and equitable principles of trade, protects investors and the public interest, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers Im all ears. Go ahead, give it a try!

Now, lets take this convoluted, inefficient structure, add in a regulatory revolving door, corrupt campaign contribution system and corrupt politicians, mix it all together, and out comes the US crony capitalist system.

**GET OFF THE SOAP BOX DAVE, WHAT DO WE DO?**

So glad you asked. Ive been asked a bunch of times what I think should change about US market structure, what I would do if I was SEC Chair (imagine that), etc. My answer is nearly always the same  reduce complexity. When I say reduce complexity, this post is what Im talking about:

 End the self-regulatory structure. 

 Build a proper regulator (complete overhaul of the SEC) with experts who are compensated appropriately.

 Prioritize handcuffs, not wrist slaps and fines. Make the industry fearful of regulatory and enforcement consequences.

 Reduce the number of exchanges, end public subsidy through SIP fees, get rid of every copycat exchange.

 Create a burden for off-exchange trading to compensate for the damage that segmenting and diverting flow does to the price discovery mechanism.

 Simplify, Simplify, SIMPLIFY!

**Tldr;** Wall St cannot regulate itself. It leads to unnecessary complexity, and lax enforcement and fines instead of perp walks. Its time to overhaul the regulatory structure, send people to jail, and simplify market structure dramatically.

https://preview.redd.it/qxwvt27pde081.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52e13bcb6afcf07d6cbe94a22ad841abc9d4237f

**ALRIGHT ENOUGH HISTORY DAVE, WTF IS THE SIP??**

Sorry, its hard to talk about this stuff without getting deep in the weeds. The SIP is generally referred to as the public data feed  at the moment (though this is changing), it provides top-of-book quotes across all US exchanges, calculates the NBBO and publishes it, communicates regulatory halts and other information, and publishes all trades both on- and off-exchange. 

**And guess what? You pay for it.**

Thats right  you are paying for the SIP. Nearly every retail broker subscribes to the SIP, and generally speaking when you see the prices that a stock is being quoted at, or trading for, youre seeing SIP data. This public data feed costs $4 per user, per month, for non-professional, display-only users  if youre not a financial professional, and youre only seeing the data with your eyes (rather than programming a trading system that will automatically look at the data), then you are a non-professional, display-only user.

What are all of those user fees worth? Something on the order of &gt; $300M per year. That money is collected by the operators of the SIP (NYSE and Nasdaq), and distributed according to a very complicated formula to each of the exchanges. On the whole, it gets divided up based on quoting and trading market share, and means that approximately $100M every year goes to CBOE, NYSE and Nasdaq (with much less going to the smaller exchanges). Thats why BATS/DirectEdge (and now CBOE, which acquired them in 2016) was incentivized to continue to operate 4 exchanges, because it meant that more of this public subsidy would go to them. Talk about perverse  its the exact opposite of what the 1934 Exchange Act was established to do:

https://preview.redd.it/4d8qt0ypde081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0ac012182acf763a75a7db5c2ae88a81b77b365

It gets even worse (No way Dave! How can it be worse than this??). Each exchange sells private data feeds that are faster and contain more information than the SIP. So the exchanges are incentivized to ensure that the SIP remains slow, and has less data, so they can make more money selling their private feeds. Pretty sweet gig if you can get it, right?

Now, Ive simplified the issue, of course. It gets even more complex with Reg NMS and order protection, which requires all exchanges to connect and route to one another, and brokers to manage that complexity as well. It means that CBOE gets double the revenue for private market data, and other connectivity fees, all of which ensures that CBOE earnings per share are robust and growing, and which accomplishes the opposite of the intention of the 1934 Act.

**Second SRO Problem: SRO structure is a classic example of regulation and subsidy creating inefficient and costly complexity.**

The BATS/DirectEdge example is only one of so many that highlight the unnecessary complexity at the heart of US markets. Ive talked many times about the need for regulators to understand complex systems and systems theory, to understand evolving regulatory structures in that context, and to focus on simplifying markets rather than making them more complex. Unnecessary complexity leads to several problems:

1. Opacity  it becomes very difficult to understand these complex systems. That leads to mistrust, and potentially loss of confidence. We are seeing that play out right now in the retail community, and for good reason. Nobody trusts Wall St.

2. Fragility  unnecessary complexity can lead to fragility. For example, the segmentation in US markets that diverts retail order flow to the duopoly of Citadel and Virtu leaves exchanges as toxic cesspools that discourage market making. This both widens spreads and reduces market making diversity, leading to behavior that can result in illiquidity contagions (mini flash crashes).

3. Rent Seeking and Concentration  unnecessary complexity incentivizes a select few firms to master the complexity. This puts them in a privileged position, and creates economies of scale where the more of the market they master and control, the more information they have that others dont, and the more theyre able to master and control. They push SROs to create ever more complexity to maintain their incumbent position, and are able to extract rents as a result. The SROs listen to these firms because they are responsible for more and more trading activity, which means they are the SROs best customers. Instead of SROs following their duties under the 1934 Act, they act in the interests of their shareholders to maximize revenue. This cycle continues unabated.

**Third SRO Problem: Unnecessary complexity makes markets opaque, fragile and leads to a feedback loop of rent seeking and concentration of power. The for-profit motive overrides the SROs duty to create fair and efficient markets.**

I mentioned before that SROs have legal immunity. This means many things, but primarily it means that the brokers who are members of the exchange dont have legal recourse when something goes wrong. It is for this reason that retail brokers who dont accept PFOF still route to the off-exchange duopoly of Citadel and Virtu, because they want someones neck to wring when something goes wrong. The legal immunity that exchanges enjoy is one of the reasons that we have dramatically segmented markets.

**Fourth SRO Problem: Legal immunity for for-profit, publicly traded companies leads to perverse incentives and terrible outcomes.**

So whats the result? A huge amount of unnecessary complexity, enforcement becoming a cost of doing business, and ultimately fragile markets with low participant diversity delivering poor outcomes for investors as the for-profit SROs focus on creating churn and volume to increase earnings per share. 

More complexity means more fragmentation. More fragmentation means more complex order types. More fragmentation and complex order types means more unnecessary trading and churn. More unnecessary trading and churn means more earnings for publicly traded SROs. Rinse and repeat. It ultimately means that we end up with so much complexity that its impossible to keep track of. Take a look at the results of this 2018 RBC study on exchange fee structure:

https://preview.redd.it/gh844bsqde081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90279af1610de6d99feacb57490cd19969b6846b

If someone can explain how this fee structure promotes just and equitable principles of trade, protects investors and the public interest, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers Im all ears. Go ahead, give it a try!

Now, lets take this convoluted, inefficient structure, add in a regulatory revolving door, corrupt campaign contribution system and corrupt politicians, mix it all together, and out comes the US crony capitalist system.

**GET OFF THE SOAP BOX DAVE, WHAT DO WE DO?**

So glad you asked. Ive been asked a bunch of times what I think should change about US market structure, what I would do if I was SEC Chair (imagine that), etc. My answer is nearly always the same  reduce complexity. When I say reduce complexity, this post is what Im talking about:

 End the self-regulatory structure. 

 Build a proper regulator (complete overhaul of the SEC) with experts who are compensated appropriately.

 Prioritize handcuffs, not wrist slaps and fines. Make the industry fearful of regulatory and enforcement consequences.

 Reduce the number of exchanges, end public subsidy through SIP fees, get rid of every copycat exchange.

 Create a burden for off-exchange trading to compensate for the damage that segmenting and diverting flow does to the price discovery mechanism.

 Simplify, Simplify, SIMPLIFY!

**Tldr;** Wall St cannot regulate itself. It leads to unnecessary complexity, and lax enforcement and fines instead of perp walks. Its time to overhaul the regulatory structure, send people to jail, and simplify market structure dramatically.

Just like bit coin mining companies values are directly correlated with the price of bit coin, uranium mining companies value is directly correlated with the spot price of uranium which has been on a tear reaching new highs YTD and is projected to double in price in the next few months.

**Macro Catalysts - Uranium Sector**

* Uranium sector sentiment turning increasingly positive. The global narrative has clearly shifted as it becomes abundantly clear that nuclear power has a critically important and growing role to play in the energy mix of the future especially as the ESG and clean energy push accelerates.
* The recent UN Climate Summit (COP26) reinforces global pressure to invest more aggressively into green energy. 
* The United States, Russia, China, and France now describe the once-neglected technology as a key part of their decarbonization plans and expected to invest heavily, billions, into nuclear energy.
* Previous uranium cycle peak of $150 in 2007; currently uranium has rallied to $45 from a post-Fukushima low of $20 with more fundamental catalysts
* Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT / $SRUUF) launched and has \~$1.95 B of capital and buying power specifically for uranium, and more capital being raised
* &amp;#x200B;

**Primary Catalyst:** Supply Squeeze

Supply and demand imbalance causing spot uranium price spike, which will heavily increase miner revenue. Since miners employ operational leverage to mine Uranium,  miners are leveraged bets on the uranium sector

**\[Demand\]**

* Currently, 442 nuclear reactors operate in 30 countries, consuming 200 million pounds of uranium per year. Over 50 reactors under construction and an additional 321 reactors proposed: 
   * China to build more than 150 reactors by 2035 
   * Russia 51 reactors
   * India 49 reactors
   * Saudi Arabia 16 reactors
   * US Infrastructure bill to spend US $6T for new nuclear power
   * Japan restart of at least 30 reactors needed
* Sprott Physical Uranium Trust has accumulated about 6m pounds of physical uranium since it began trading on July 19
* Uranium demand is projected to rise from 162m pounds in 2021 to 206m pounds in 2030, then to 292m pounds in 2040

**\[Supply\]**

&amp;#x200B;

* The supply deficit is currently 20 million pounds and could reach as much as 50 million pounds as mine production has been suspended due to COVID-19

\-  Utilities have been underbuying uranium since 2014, this deficit has been filled by the drawdown of existing inventories. US inventories have drawn down 30% over the last 12 months, left with around 2.5 years of inventory. Given the long lead time required for uranium delivery, utilities historically do not let their inventories fall below the 2-3 year coverage level. Utilities may need to start entering the market to secure more uranium.

\-  At the same time, in response to lower prices, uranium producers began cutting capacity over the past several years. Most recently, these cuts have been accelerated by the recent coronavirus pandemic

**Fundamental Analysis:**

* $3.75 PT by Cantor Fitzgerald based on a 1.5x multiple on the companys Athabasca Basin uranium projects and 1.0x NPV on its net financial position (cash, investments, and Uranium in inventory)
* Recently sold half of the equity stake in GoviEx for C$15.6MM in cash upfront and up to C$41.6MM in total consideration if the warrants are exercised in full. GXU shares up 104% YTD.
* **Cash and Uranium inventory: C$220MM**
* **Market Cap: 1.4Bn**
* Successful 2021 in-situ recovery (ISR) field test program at the Phoenix deposit at its 95% owned Wheeler River Uranium Project. Successful field test provides further proof of concept on the amenability of the high-grade Phoenix deposit to the ISR extraction method. Delivered on multiple de-risking milestones. De-risking work at Wheeler River regarding the ISR mining approach to the ultra-high-grade Phoenix deposit is underappreciated by the market. Denison has made significant positive technical progress in the field in 2021 along with very positive drill results which are expected to lead to more uranium actually recovered from Phoenix. ISR technique will result in an extremely low production cost profile.

**Technical Analysis**

Bullish market structure: higher lows, higher highs for price and RSI. Recent Inverse Head and Shoulder break could indicate an imminent run

**Risks:**

* Commodity miners are at high risk due to their operational leverage and reliance on volatile commodity prices for revenue. However, with the multitude of strong macroeconomic tailwinds and supply/demand imbalance pushing up the price of uranium for the foreseeable future, promising ISR results, strong cash, investment, and Uranium position on its balance sheets, DNN is well positioned to mitigate risks in the near term.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qww57j/dnn_is_about_to_go_nuclear_literally_due_diligence/

Some background...

Aurora, also known as Aurora Innovation, Inc., is an American self-driving vehicle technology company\[1\]\[2\] based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\[3\]\[4\] and in Mountain View, California.\[5\] Aurora is known for developing the Aurora Driver, a computer system that can be integrated into cars for autonomous driving.\[6\]\[7\] Aurora was co-founded by Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google/Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving team, which became known as Waymo,\[1\]\[8\] as well as by Sterling Anderson, former head of Tesla Autopilot, and Drew Bagnell, former head of Uber's autonomy and perception team.\[9\]\[10\]

&amp;#x200B;

The company was also supported by Uber. Twenty-six percent of Aurora was owned by Uber as of December 2020.\[11\]\[12\] Nvidia partnered with Aurora to provide hardware for Aurora's self-driving systems.\[13\]\[14\]\[15\] Aurora also partnered with Toyota and Denso to develop self-driving taxis.\[16\]\[17\]\[18\]\[19\]

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at TAM... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xwbhnan5wd081.png?width=964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f137056de4b2d2880055d4fa2f30b240c8a3c80

Assuming a 10% penetration in the market, this gives them an achievable TAM of 

&amp;#x200B;

Trucking **$70B**  
Ride-Hailing **$3.5B**  
Local delivery  **$10B**

combined we are looking at around a **$83.5B** total accessible market (conservative) within 5-years.   
Let's say you are short term, and can't see past next year. Next year they are launching their trucking pilot, and let's assume they launch and are able to scale to truck delivery market first, and let's say for shits and giggles they only penetration 2.5% of the trucking market in the first  five years. That's $1.75B... Their current market cap is $12.3B. If we assume a 20x P/E, that would make their assumed/estimated **market cap $35B**. This is a hyper growth tech company. 20x P/E is peanuts retards. This shit is way underpriced. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We all know this is a shipping / logistics / trucking shortage going on. With Aurora's focus on trucking, they are in prime position to capitalize and penetrated the market much easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Another big advantage... They have already partnered with large companies to operationalize their product, and will be ready for market in each of their TAM areas!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** This shit is way undervalued compared to peers and industry. With conservative numbers, they are easily a **$35B market cap** company. They have superior LIDAR technology, and go-to market products, and have a great entry in the trucking market to address a huge TAM. This shit will be a multi-bagger, and in comparison to peers today, is super cheap. Get ready for lift-off!

The bear case is obviously that coal is going out of fashion, bad for the earth, etc. but who cares if you make money on it. It's also a fact that anyone driving a Tesla in West Virginia or Montana is powering their car on coal, so fuck em anyway.

Coal isn't going away. It's the largest energy source consumed the world over. China and India aren't stopping burning it, and ARLP exports some coal to them.

Ticker: HMONY

A fairly undervalued company compared to its competitors like Bitmain.

 

I've looked into HMONY, a Norwegian mining company with some powerful and energy-efficient ASIC's chips under development, they just bought 1000m2 in Halden, Norway for mining LTC.

With krypto reaching ATH - and LTC seems to be on the way. It looks promising to buy stocks in the mining industry.

How far do you think LTC is going to reach in the next coming months?

So a bit about the company I've looked into and invested in + some bullet points.

Strong and healthy balance sheet, good management with proper education, awesome SCRYPT tech.

Harmonychain AS develops proprietary blockchain software (Scryptpool mining software in closed alpha + cryptocurrency IPR) and hardware (Scrypt ASIC R&amp;D in Lokotech AS + data centre in Arctic Core AS).

recently purchased their first property for developing a data centre of 995 m2 in Halden, Norway. The property is part of a former industrial property and has access to electricity transformers on site

Scrypt miner with a higher hash rate, lower power consumption (0.099 J/MH) and lower price than competitors.

Had a breakout from 0.9 NOK this week, and it's still rising.

Compared to its small market cap of 15m USD to its competitors like Bitmain soon to set sail against going public with 40-50B market cap it isn't dream thinking to assume that this little Norwegian gem might blow up.

1,"11/19/2021, 01:26:37",$YALA insane Q3 Earnings and Meta universe stock,Prestigious-Art-7257,"   the company's active promotion and operation strategies in the third quarter, the company's voice social networking and gaming businesses continued to maintain steady growth, and South America also made positive progress. In addition, on the basis of its core business, the company is actively advancing the development of medium-to-heavy games, next-generation meta-universe social networking, IM and other fields, and making adjustments in areas such as talent expansion and organizational structure. We believe that the company's outstanding localized operating capabilities, stable business model, profitability, and good cash flow all support the company's subsequent performance growth. In the short term, the company's overall valuation has become attractive after a substantial adjustment in the stock price in the early period, and the positive development of new businesses will bring a catalyst for the company's stock price to rise.

  **Performance overview:** The core financial indicators are close to the upper limit of the guidelines, and the profitability remains stable. In the third quarter, revenue was 71.3 million U.S. dollars (+110.8%), and adjusted net profit was 33.2 million U.S. dollars (+114.5%), corresponding to a net profit margin of 46.6%, and revenue was close to the previous companys guidance ceiling. In terms of business segments, the companys revenue from chat was US$53.9 million, and its gaming service revenue was US$17.4 million. The proportion of revenue from gaming business continued to increase. Although the company has continued to invest in marketing and R&amp;D since entering the third quarter, it has benefited from relatively effective operating strategies and overall profits have remained stable. In addition, the company continued to maintain a stable repurchase rhythm, with a cumulative repurchase amount of US$14 million in the third quarter. The company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of 67 million to 72 million US dollars, corresponding to a revenue growth rate of 38.6% to 48.9%. The natural decline in growth rate mainly reflects the higher base in the 2020Q4 quarter. At the user level, the company is expected to continue to maintain a chain growth rate of more than double digits.

 **Existing products**: Continue to maintain steady growth. In the third quarter, the companys voice chat product Yalla continued to maintain steady growth. The user-level MAU in the third quarter was 9.47 million (+13% quarter-on-quarter). Thanks to active campaign marketing and the increase in original user participation, 1.219 million paid users in the third quarter , Corresponding to the payment rate of 13%, continued to remain stable. The game platform YallaLudo continued to maintain high growth. In the third quarter, the user MAU was 15.69 million (+15% from the previous quarter). At the monetization level, Ludo paid 6.16 million users, corresponding to a payment rate of 39%. The steady growth of core products shows the company's competitive advantages in localization and product operations. We expect that the MAU users of the above products will continue to maintain a double-digit growth rate compared to the previous month. 

**Innovative business**: The South American market is progressing smoothly, and social entertainment platforms are gradually enriched. Relying on outstanding product capabilities and operational strategies, the company's South American product YallaParchis continued to make positive progress. In the third quarter, the product MAU reached 786,000 and 300,000 paying users. Although large-scale monetization has not yet started, referring to the growth path of the company Ludo, with the continuous growth of users and the improvement of product capabilities, the medium and long-term growth is worth looking forward to. At the other product level, YallaBaloot and 101Okey have entered the promotion stage, and YallaChat has also entered the final polishing stage of the product. In addition, the company has also deployed Metaverse related products in advance, and will explore and deploy from the perspective of social interaction and entertainment. In addition, the company announced its entry into the publishing business of medium to heavy games, enriching the company's social and entertainment platform from more areas. 

**outlook**: The business is gradually landing, and the valuation is attractive. We believe that the company's competitive advantage in the MENA region is still outstanding, and the gradual implementation of IM, games and South America will open up more room for growth for the company. At the same time, with the expansion of business and the advancement of personnel recruitment, the company's organizational structure and culture have continued to be optimized. Valuation layer 7.36 USD On the other hand, after substantial adjustments in the previous period, the current companys PE corresponding to Non-GAAP in 2022 is already less than 10 times, which is significantly lower than the valuation of game companies. At present, the company still has a remaining repurchase plan of more than 100 million U.S. dollars, and the company has more than 326 million U.S. dollars in cash in hand, which will provide positive support for subsequent business investment and repurchase. Risk factors: the risks caused by stricter policy supervision and geopolitical instability in the Middle East; the risk of seasonal disturbances caused by some traditional Arabian festivals and customs; the risk of some manufacturers launching similar products to intensify competition; the risk of changes in app store policies; The introduction of new products causes the risk of pressure on cash and profits, etc. 

**Investment advice:** Taking into account the company's release rhythm of operating product profitability and the outlook for 2021Q4, we adjust the company's profit forecast for 2021-2023. We estimate that the companys revenue for 2021-2023 will be 274/3.434.45 billion U.S. dollars (original forecast 2.75/4.28/597 million U.S. dollars), and Non-GAAP net profit will be 1.24/1.35/191 million U.S. dollars (original forecast 1.26/2.01/289 billion) Dollar). The current company valuation corresponding to Non-GAAPPE from 2021-2023 is only 9/7/6 times. We continue to be optimistic about the company's growth and medium- and long-term investment value based on the company's localization capabilities. volume\_up*content\_copyshare*",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwusfe/yala_insane_q3_earnings_and_meta_universe_stock/

I bought in back in the summer when GME shot past $300 (my roommate convinced me it could hit a thousand or more). Shortly after it dropped to about half of that. Fortunately for me I've only got (literally) a few shares, but I keep hearing about an impending market crash and even if I only have about $1,000 tied up in this stock, I'd very much rather take the loss and get out now with $800 than keep holding and come out with like $200 or less.

I'd been following Matt Kohrs for a while and he (and commenters on his channel) started talking about how despite the supposed short squeeze/gamma squeeze that was supposed to come, the hedgies have literally manipulated the market so they can't (and don't) lose, so holding GME/AMC went from being this cool/hip/noble thing to maybe not so much. Are they ever going to go to the moon? Is that gamma squeeze ever going to happen? Currently I'm led to believe no. The market is definitely at least somewhat corrupt.

I've been watching the stock price, my current plan is to wait until the stock gets as close to my average stock price as possible (currently about $20 under) and then probably sell all but one share, maybe all of them.

Yes, I'm an ape, yes I got in on this as more of a fad/meme (I lost much smaller amounts on several other stocks, but this and AMC were supposed to be worth the risk), and so I'm trying to do what seems smart/safe and not lose any more than necessary at this point.

Any advice, insight, or feedback anyone wants to offer? Bear in mind that I already admitted I'm not a 'smart' investor, I've lost money, I took those lumps, learned this game is not for me, and am now trying to minimize damage and get out. 

What I would appreciate is explaining how/why AMC/GME haven't shot up more yet. What happened to all that short interest?

A true undervalued company compared to its competitors like Bitmain.

This is going to take us to lamboland fellow autists.

Strong and healthy balance sheet, good management with proper education, awesome SCRYPT tech.

With krypto reaching ATH - and LTC on the way it looks promising to buy stocks in the mining industry.

Harmonychain AS develops proprietary blockchain software (Scryptpool mining software in closed alpha + cryptocurrency IPR) and hardware (Scrypt ASIC R&amp;D in Lokotech AS + data centre in Arctic Core AS).

recently purchased their first property for developing a data centre of 995 m2  in Halden, Norway. expected to take over the property on or around 16.11.2021. The property is part of a former industrial property and has access to electricity transformers on site

Scrypt miner with a higher hash rate, lower power consumption (0.099 J/MH) and lower price than competitors.

Had a breakout from 0.9 NOK this week, looks promising when the stock exchange announcement comes this 16 of Nov.

Compared to its small market cap of 15m USD to its competitors like Bitmain soon to set sail against going public with 40-50B market cap it isn't dream thinking to assume that this little Norwegian gem might blow up, not going to jinx it but, this is the one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwtsxm/norwegian_stock_gem_set_for_the_moon/

While this is kind of silly and a bit absurd (though it did happen!), I think its worth examining and explaining how the incentives for a self-regulatory, for-profit company lead to extreme complexity and subsidization in US markets. Its easy to say self-regulatory BAD! but harder to understand the web of complexity that such perverse structures create.

This is a long post. By the end, I hope you understand what the self-regulatory structure is, why it exists, why it creates perverse incentives, and how I think it should be fixed. Ill do my best to explain the context of these archaic structure, why it leads to unnecessary complexity, and reduces competitive forces. Most importantly, throughout the piece think about how such perverse incentives leads to lax enforcement and wrist slaps, and a cozy relationship with the industry being regulated.

https://preview.redd.it/zit25vyjtd081.jpg?width=1181&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=039d1b099d93f151e71b7257827d5690cd3612e0

The financial services industry is the only industry in America (that I am aware of) in which for-profit, publicly traded firms are self-regulatory. What does self-regulatory mean and where did it come from? The structure came about from the member-owned stock exchanges that existed prior to 1934. In 1934 these exchanges were brought into partnership with federal regulators in the Exchange Act of 1934. This actually made a lot of sense. There was nobody better positioned to monitor and enforce the rules of a stock exchange (where trading happened in a physical location, on the floor of the exchange) than the exchange itself. There were conflicts-of-interest, of course, but there were also practical considerations of what technology and communication systems looked like in the early 1900s.

So what does self-regulatory mean? Now of course, Im no lawyer, so take everything I say with that in mind. Essentially the self-regulatory structure gives the regulation arm of the exchange quasi-governmental powers (its been explained to me that this structure means the exchange is supposed to act as an extension of the SEC)  and gives the exchange itself immunity from prosecution when carrying out regulatory functions. It basically means that US exchanges set the rules for trading in US markets, and for interacting with their business, are then in charge of enforcing those rules and have no legal liability in the operation of that business. Those rules include things like fee structure, order types, matching priority model, co-location and data feed costs, and many other things.

That means each for-profit exchange is setting its own rules, and responsible for enforcing those rules. Each exchange is responsible for monitoring its own market for manipulation (called market surveillance). In reality, the responsibility for market surveillance is outsourced to FINRA. FINRA is another SRO  they are not a for-profit exchange, but they are responsible for setting the rules and policing broker/dealers. You may have heard of some of the other SROs  the DTCC, the OCC, the NSCC and others listed [here](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml).

FINRA, DTCC, OCC and NSCC are not for-profit, of course, but they are deeply conflicted. They operate on the fees generated by their members, who they police and regulate; stock exchanges do too  their best customers are high-speed speculators (aka HFT), who submit 95% of all orders, and are a party to \~90% of all trades. These speculators also pay for expensive, proprietary data feeds, high-speed connections and cross-connects, and other exchange services. SROs are supposed to police these customers, and are charged with ensuring that their best customers follow the rules. 

*Gee Dave, that sounds like a conflict-of-interest! At least its not for anything important, like the foundation of the US economy, right?*

It is generally the SROs that have made breaking the rules a cost of doing business (naturally following the lead of the SEC, of course). While they dont have the authority to press criminal charges (again, not a lawyer) they could easily make referrals and work with the DOJ, who does have that authority. Instead, nearly all of Wall St has decided that breaking the rules is nearly always only worth a fine, very rarely an industry ban, and practically never a perp walk and prison.

Just like nobody lost their banking license for fraud following the Great Financial Crisis, can you remember a time when a major broker/dealer had their license revoked? Robinhood has been fined well over $100M by FINRA and the SEC for lying to their customers, failing to provide best execution, and underinvesting in compliance, technology and any system for protecting their customers. For some reason, none of this was enough to lose their license to operate. Those guys are laughing all the way to the bank. Fine after fine is charged to every broker on Wall St, paid by the shareholders, and everyone keeps collecting their bonuses. 

**First SRO Problem: Reluctance to exact severe consequences because the fees being collected from the perps are paying for SRO operations and bonuses.**

However, theres another side to all of this. Lets take a concrete example to start. In 2014, BATS and DirectEdge merged. Together, they represented approximately 20% of trading in the US. Each of them operated 2 copycat exchanges  a maker/taker exchange (BZX and EDGX) and an inverted exchange (BYX and EDGA). In any other industry, such a merger would result in the consolidation of these exchanges so that the resulting company would only operate 2 exchanges. But that didnt happen here. They continued to run 4 exchanges and do to this day. Why would they do that when it costs way more to run 4 exchanges rather than 2? The answer is actually quite simple and obvious  money. To understand why, we have to take a quick step back, and reference another law.

The 1975 Amendments to the 1934 Exchange Act established the need (and gave the SEC the authority) to create the Securities Information Processor (SIP). It was groundbreaking at the time. The SIP is the ticker  a record of quotes and trades on all national securities exchanges. Ultimately the SEC did NOT create such a system though, it delegated the authority to the exchanges. The exchanges created the NMS Committees, which are responsible for managing the SIP and setting fees. From last years SEC press release announcing changes to the SIP:

https://preview.redd.it/nju99avktd081.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc4feb1db8111b6a925f262f6e3b6b333407299a

**ALRIGHT ENOUGH HISTORY DAVE, WTF IS THE SIP??**

Sorry, its hard to talk about this stuff without getting deep in the weeds. The SIP is generally referred to as the public data feed  at the moment (though this is changing), it provides top-of-book quotes across all US exchanges, calculates the NBBO and publishes it, communicates regulatory halts and other information, and publishes all trades both on- and off-exchange. 

**And guess what? You pay for it.**

Thats right  you are paying for the SIP. Nearly every retail broker subscribes to the SIP, and generally speaking when you see the prices that a stock is being quoted at, or trading for, youre seeing SIP data. This public data feed costs $4 per user, per month, for non-professional, display-only users  if youre not a financial professional, and youre only seeing the data with your eyes (rather than programming a trading system that will automatically look at the data), then you are a non-professional, display-only user.

What are all of those user fees worth? Something on the order of &gt; $300M per year. That money is collected by the operators of the SIP (NYSE and Nasdaq), and distributed according to a very complicated formula to each of the exchanges. On the whole, it gets divided up based on quoting and trading market share, and means that approximately $100M every year goes to CBOE, NYSE and Nasdaq (with much less going to the smaller exchanges). Thats why BATS/DirectEdge (and now CBOE, which acquired them in 2016) was incentivized to continue to operate 4 exchanges, because it meant that more of this public subsidy would go to them. Talk about perverse  its the exact opposite of what the 1934 Exchange Act was established to do:

https://preview.redd.it/eoshk6lltd081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8696322c3d3e021424e034582590c5da7042bd63

It gets even worse (No way Dave! How can it be worse than this??). Each exchange sells private data feeds that are faster and contain more information than the SIP. So the exchanges are incentivized to ensure that the SIP remains slow, and has less data, so they can make more money selling their private feeds. Pretty sweet gig if you can get it, right?

Now, Ive simplified the issue, of course. It gets even more complex with Reg NMS and order protection, which requires all exchanges to connect and route to one another, and brokers to manage that complexity as well. It means that CBOE gets double the revenue for private market data, and other connectivity fees, all of which ensures that CBOE earnings per share are robust and growing, and which accomplishes the opposite of the intention of the 1934 Act.

**Second SRO Problem: SRO structure is a classic example of regulation and subsidy creating inefficient and costly complexity.**

The BATS/DirectEdge example is only one of so many that highlight the unnecessary complexity at the heart of US markets. Ive talked many times about the need for regulators to understand complex systems and systems theory, to understand evolving regulatory structures in that context, and to focus on simplifying markets rather than making them more complex. Unnecessary complexity leads to several problems:

1. Opacity  it becomes very difficult to understand these complex systems. That leads to mistrust, and potentially loss of confidence. We are seeing that play out right now in the retail community, and for good reason. Nobody trusts Wall St.

2. Fragility  unnecessary complexity can lead to fragility. For example, the segmentation in US markets that diverts retail order flow to the duopoly of Citadel and Virtu leaves exchanges as toxic cesspools that discourage market making. This both widens spreads and reduces market making diversity, leading to behavior that can result in illiquidity contagions (mini flash crashes).

3. Rent Seeking and Concentration  unnecessary complexity incentivizes a select few firms to master the complexity. This puts them in a privileged position, and creates economies of scale where the more of the market they master and control, the more information they have that others dont, and the more theyre able to master and control. They push SROs to create ever more complexity to maintain their incumbent position, and are able to extract rents as a result. The SROs listen to these firms because they are responsible for more and more trading activity, which means they are the SROs best customers. Instead of SROs following their duties under the 1934 Act, they act in the interests of their shareholders to maximize revenue. This cycle continues unabated.

**Third SRO Problem: Unnecessary complexity makes markets opaque, fragile and leads to a feedback loop of rent seeking and concentration of power. The for-profit motive overrides the SROs duty to create fair and efficient markets.**

I mentioned before that SROs have legal immunity. This means many things, but primarily it means that the brokers who are members of the exchange dont have legal recourse when something goes wrong. It is for this reason that retail brokers who dont accept PFOF still route to the off-exchange duopoly of Citadel and Virtu, because they want someones neck to wring when something goes wrong. The legal immunity that exchanges enjoy is one of the reasons that we have dramatically segmented markets.

**Fourth SRO Problem: Legal immunity for for-profit, publicly traded companies leads to perverse incentives and terrible outcomes.**

So whats the result? A huge amount of unnecessary complexity, enforcement becoming a cost of doing business, and ultimately fragile markets with low participant diversity delivering poor outcomes for investors as the for-profit SROs focus on creating churn and volume to increase earnings per share. 

More complexity means more fragmentation. More fragmentation means more complex order types. More fragmentation and complex order types means more unnecessary trading and churn. More unnecessary trading and churn means more earnings for publicly traded SROs. Rinse and repeat. It ultimately means that we end up with so much complexity that its impossible to keep track of. Take a look at the results of this 2018 RBC study on exchange fee structure:

https://preview.redd.it/2c24cd9mtd081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232e50078bf22cfe476db4b3ec35cd839e2fb8ef

If someone can explain how this fee structure promotes just and equitable principles of trade, protects investors and the public interest, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers Im all ears. Go ahead, give it a try!

Now, lets take this convoluted, inefficient structure, add in a regulatory revolving door, corrupt campaign contribution system and corrupt politicians, mix it all together, and out comes the US crony capitalist system.

**GET OFF THE SOAP BOX DAVE, WHAT DO WE DO?**

So glad you asked. Ive been asked a bunch of times what I think should change about US market structure, what I would do if I was SEC Chair (imagine that), etc. My answer is nearly always the same  reduce complexity. When I say reduce complexity, this post is what Im talking about:

 End the self-regulatory structure. 

 Build a proper regulator (complete overhaul of the SEC) with experts who are compensated appropriately.

 Prioritize handcuffs, not wrist slaps and fines. Make the industry fearful of regulatory and enforcement consequences.

 Reduce the number of exchanges, end public subsidy through SIP fees, get rid of every copycat exchange.

 Create a burden for off-exchange trading to compensate for the damage that segmenting and diverting flow does to the price discovery mechanism.

 Simplify, Simplify, SIMPLIFY!

**Tldr;** Wall St cannot regulate itself. It leads to unnecessary complexity, and lax enforcement and fines instead of perp walks. Its time to overhaul the regulatory structure, send people to jail, and simplify market structure dramatically.

It's not a glamorous business, doesn't have full-time CMs posting memes on Twitter, and isn't a particularly shorted stock. In sums, not a great WSB candidate on paper (ha!)  but only on paper, though.

Because $RFP does have one thing for itself that most stocks in this inflated market haven't. **$RFP is, by all standards, extremely cheap**. Price to earnings ratio is **2.31**; price to sales, **0.24**  and best of all, the book value per share is north of **$17.5**, way above the \~$11 levels that $RFP is currently trading at. **Yes, the assets of the company are worth more than what its current market cap even implies.** For those unfamiliar with BVPS (Book Value Per Share), here's a quick excerpt from Investopedia:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The book value per share (BVPS) metric can be used by investors to gauge whether a stock price is undervalued by comparing it to the firm's market value per share. If a companys BVPS is higher than its market* *per shareits current stock pricethen the stock is considered undervalued*

&amp;#x200B;

**Now you may ask: alright, what in the world does this company do?**

&amp;#x200B;

Resolute Forest Products, together with its subsidiaries, operates in the forest products industry in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and internationally. The company operates through four segments: Market Pulp, Tissue, Wood Products, and Paper.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lumber prices over the past 5 years](https://preview.redd.it/eeze22s9qd081.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a6db490f00a795a561ec5bee58722b1be064991)

&amp;#x200B;

Given the nature of its business, Resolute Forest Products' revenues heavily depend on lumber prices, which have experienced a dramatic run-up in the first half of 2021. As a consequence, they recorded record revenues and are expected to continue doing so in the years to come despite the usual seasonality in timber companies sales. During Q2 2021, total revenue reached $1.14B: almost twice as much as Q2 2020, a move largely supported by the spike in lumber prices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is the company financially healthy?**

&amp;#x200B;

[Comparison of D\/E ratios within the industry](https://preview.redd.it/vwxck8faqd081.png?width=1652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b81951674fd11eaee223fc6b440921f1a170d76)

&amp;#x200B;

With a **debt-to-equity ratio of \~25%**, Resolute Forest Products positions itself very reasonably compared to the other players in the industry. With the recent windfall, they have been deleveraging  efficiently and lowering their debt. In fact, **net debt could approach zero by early 2022**.

Sky-high cash flow has allowed the company to prepare for a more profitable future. Best of all, $RFP holds shareholder value maximization very much at heart. **They distributed a special dividend of $1** at the end of June 2021 and **have repurchased 1.2 million shares at an average price of $10.95** last quarter (remember: way under $RFP's BVPS!). 

&amp;#x200B;

**So, what's next for $RFP?**

&amp;#x200B;

[Forecasts of lumber prices going into 2022](https://preview.redd.it/xmgtjdyaqd081.png?width=1404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6da8f7eff14abe5ff397c3911a91f9ec8ffd5689)

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the timing to be ideal: historically, lumber company stocks tend to dip in August and September and then rise at the end of the year. On the plus side, lumber prices are slowly going back up, with **March 2022 futures already trading at +$750**, notably fuelled by the accelerating growth of homebuilding. In a Fortune article dated of October 2021, Scott Reaves from Domain Timber Advisors (an investment advisory firm specialized on the sector) declared: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*We expect the demand forlumberto continue increasing through2022and beyond in response to demographically driven housing needs, which will bode well for not onlylumbermills but forestland owners*

&amp;#x200B;

After all, why would lumber prices decrease? The forest in Canada and the USA have been burning all summer; homebuilding has a huge backlog; and **May had the largest home permit applications on record by NAOHB** (National Association of Home Builders). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Enough talk, what's your price target?**

&amp;#x200B;

If you bore with me so far, well done! With all the above information in mind, **I believe $RFP could easily reach $15/16 EOY**, and has reasonable chances of **surpassing the $20 levels by early 2022**. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Are there any potential risk factors?**

&amp;#x200B;

While Resolute Forest Products is poised to grow, its revenues could be adversely affected should lumber prices experience a downturn. Other macro-economics market conditions could potentially slow $RFP's expected rally toward its fair value. But **with more than 50% upside within the year to come**, this opportunity just seems to be too big to ignore.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:** $14/15 calls ranging from December to April 2022

Basic chips are commodity product. But Like electricity or water or natgas this is basic needs. 

Massive upfront capex limiting new entrants. 

Scale required - so room for a handful of players to consolidate industry capacity. 

Seen as matter of national security. 

What would happen if you applied utility multiples to GFS if you assume that it becomes a government protected US monopoly on onshore US chip manufacturing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwt0df/if_chip_foundries_are_basically_digitalage/

I was having fun just moving shares around and making small amounts of money. Then a few weeks ago I decided to try options. I bought an apple call that went up a couple hundred bucks. I was amazed at how easy it was to make money with options. Then I decided to put a bunch of money into Delta Airlines calls expiring in January and February. Initially they went up, and I was making more money than ever before. But then they started to go down. As I'm writing this, my weekly chart is down almost 20%. This is all the money I had in my saving account. I'm not sure when I will crack, but at this rate it will be sometime soon. I'm still holding, but I can't focus on school or anything else because all I can think about is how much money I'm losing.

My question is, how do you guys deal with waking up in the morning and seeing huge losses? How do you keep going?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwswdf/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_seeing_big_losses/

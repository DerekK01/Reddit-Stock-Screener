My new price-target for BNTX-sock because off OMICRON is now **650$**. Remember tripple witching day is coming. **BNTX is now a parabolic trapped long.**

I bought BNTX at 210$, hopping that it will beat the trend channel. It did brilliant. Then i hopped, that it will stay above 300$, as you see in the chart i attached. It did brilliant again. Now it seems it will go to 450$ and then **boosters up to at least 650$.**

Sorry for my bad english, it's not my mother-tongue.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* US Stocks fell in a global selloff as fears grew that a new coronavirus type discovered in South Africa might trigger new outbreaks and jeopardise the fragile economic recovery. The value of haven assets soared.
* It's the S&amp;P 500's worst post-Thanksgiving performance since 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill making the fourth Thursday in November a national holiday.
* The Russell 2000 index fell 3.7%, and the Nasdaq 100 index fell to its lowest close in nearly two weeks. Stocks in the travel and leisure sector fell, while those in the stay-at-home sector rose. The Stoxx 600 index in Europe fell 3.7%, the highest since June 2020. For the first time since late September, oil dipped below $70 a barrel in New York.
* Treasury yields jumped on haven bids, with the 10-year yield falling to its lowest level since March 2020 on a closing basis, as traders pushed back bets on the Fed raising rates.
* With the dollar sinking, the Japanese yen emerged as the main safe-haven currency of the day.

Wall St shorted the ENTIRE FUCKING MARKET going into the pandemic. Im talking SO MANY fundamentally sound stocks are have SI in the 18-40% range. Id like to talk about my favorite and why I think it could beginning squeezing soon:

KIRKLANDS ($KIRK):

Retailer that does online decor and gifts. Specialize in holiday offerings.

From a more speculative stand point, the only retail getting hit right now seem to be ones that dont take a hybrid approach to retail (both brick and mortar and e-commerce). Kirk has a very similar business model as a, say, Macys, and feel very confident they wont run into similar issues as Nordstrom or Gap.

But fundamentally and technically is where things get really interesting!

Its profitable, and cash strong.

The returns are extremely impressive- 10% ROA, 5% ROI, and 41% ROE! And this is all while having zero debt!!!

Record breaking earnings last quarter and expected to set records again Q3.

RSI of 50 and a BETA of +2. Next bull run in the market is gonna be a big for KIRK.

And the kicker.. 22% SHORT

This company is going nowhere but up right now. The only concern here would be supply chain issues, and it seems their management is too strong to allow that to happen. Most retail with good business models are figuring it out.

If this thing has blowout earnings and catches retail volume, its gonna explode. Dont miss out!

The token is interesting in the sense that there was no premint, no presale, no early insider access, early team members probably have little to no tokens.  Extremely fair distribution, which is very rare.  The founders of the project it called it quits, so there is no authority behind it.  A truly decentralized token.

Online retailer Wish (WISH), operated by ContextLogic, has long been known for its unusual product lines. YouTube is full of videos involving people ordering things from Wish, from gaming PCs to improbably inexpensive handguns and body armor.

The quality of items on Wish is often wildly variable, and it's likely that mixed bag of product quality that led one country to shut down Wish altogether. That kind of hostility isn't good for any company's long-term prospects, and that's why I'm bearish on Wish. (SeeAnalysts Top Stockson TipRanks)

So I have personally started 3 companies that all failed, I am almost 30 now and from all that I have been through I think the thing that is missing is network and using the network.

Currently I decided I am not interested in a building a company, I just want to generate revenue.

This is a wild chase but I was wondering if there are other people who want to do the same but need help for X,Y or Z. Essentially a group of people to match their skills to double on every chance.

I am not trying to sell you anything, I am just looking to find a group like this or create one.

**Intro:**

**This is a long term play, shares or LEAPS are the way to go.**

Ive been buying logitech speakers and other products for a long time, theyve always been great as a budget option for this category. I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. Im a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. Ive now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone back when I was a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if youre a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...youve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? Ive generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever.

Todays pop was likely caused by a Citi Analyst raising their price target, thank you to /u/yoyo248 for pointing this out:

* ""@algobotnews
Logitech risk/reward offers 'very attractive opportunity,' says Citi""

https://twitter.com/algobotnews/status/1461291610923311109

*Logitech International SA is a holding company, which engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of peripherals for PCs, tablets, and other digital platforms. Its products include mice, keyboards, presentation remotes, headsets, and speakers. The firm offers solutions for healthy computing, wireless charging, streaming, virtual reality, rom home, schools, healthcare, and software and apps. Its brands include Logitech, Jaybird, Ultimate Ears, Logitech G, ASTRO Gaming, and Blue Microphones. The company was founded by Daniel Borel, Pierluigi Zappacosta, and Giacamo Marini on October 2, 1981 and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland (marketbeat.com)*

**The below DD uses multiple sources. Sorry Im not using Harvard referencing, but my Physics papers have made me sick to death of that so Im only doing a bibliography and linking a few articles I sourced from (not all because Reddit doesn't allow you to link a few of the sites). Please PM me if you want this since Reddit blocks a few of the links:**

**Logitech is referenced as a good post-pandemic play, for a variety of reasons:**
* The company is benefiting from COVID trends, but also secular trends (A secular trend or market is one that is likely to continue moving in the same general direction for the foreseeable future. ... The secular movement of a long-term trend can be neutral (flat), positive, or negative in its direction.).

* It is sustaining YOY growth, paying a very safe dividend (in my research it is strongly recommended as a dividend stock). The company is investing in the future (ill get onto this later).
Operations are within target, theres strong cash flow and free cash flow.

* Logitech had a great quarter (despite rising costs, material shortfalls and margin pressure). On a two year basis, revenue is up more than 82%. No doubt due to the gaming boom during the pandemic. 
It is said that logitech is underperforming in cams, tablet accessories, video and headsets (which all saw high-double-digit growth last year). Which Im surprised to see, as Im friends with some cam girls, and the device of choice in that industry is and always has been the Logitech C920 webcam. Maybe a surge of Pandemic cam girls will offset this (in all seriousness lol, great brand loyalty to Logitech there).

* They are delivering strength in keyboards, pointers and gaming equipment. Which doesnt surprise me. Ive been doing flight sims and sim racing for a long time. On the low to mid end, Logitech has been my choice and the recommended choice for flight sticks and sim wheels. Logitech is killing it in the low/mid end sim racing market. 

**Earnings:**

* Operating income, both GAAP and adjusted, fell 40% but largely due to a 60% increase in marketing and 30% increase in R&amp;D. Which are acceptable reasons, as they should result in higher sales long-term. 

* The company reaffirmed its guidance for revenue and earnings at the previously stated range.  This is calling for full-year growth in the range of flat to +/- 5% which we view as a wide range given this years YTD strength. The comps are going to get tougher before they get easy again but the two strongest quarters of the fiscal year are still ahead. In our view, Logitech should produce at least flat to slightly higher YOY revenue if not growth in the mid-single-digit range. (https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/logitech-is-still-a-logical-choice-for-dividend-growth-portfolios/?focus=NASDAQ:LOGI)

* In Q2, adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share fell short of the consensus estimate of $1.10 per share. The company reported earnings of $1.56 per share in the prior-year period.

* However, revenues of $1.31 billion were up 4% from the previous years quarter and surpassed the Streets estimates of $1.27 billion.
 * Notably, Logitech reaffirmed its guidance for Fiscal 2022. The company expects flat sales growth in constant currency with a probable variation of nearly 5%. Further, it expects to report adjusted operating income in the range of $800 million to $850 million.
(https://www.tipranks.com/news/logitech-posts-mixed-fiscal-q2-results/)

* Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell commented, In Q2 we delivered record sales which beat last years exceptional sales levels, growing 4% in the quarter and 82% compared to two years ago. We also grew market share in the majority of our key product categories.
Looking forward, he added We are confirming our full year outlook, despite unprecedented supply chain industry challenges. I am excited about the long-term growth potential of Logitech.

* Q2 sales were $1.31 billion, up 4 percent in US dollars and 2 percent in constant currency, compared to Q2 of the prior year.

* Q2 GAAP operating income declined 44 percent to $179 million, compared to $322 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q2 GAAP earnings per share (EPS) declined 48 percent to $0.81, compared to $1.56 in the same quarter a year ago.
* Q2 non-GAAP operating income declined 40 percent to $211 million, compared to $354 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q2 non-GAAP EPS declined 44 percent to $1.05, compared to $1.87 in the same quarter a year ago.

* In Q2 we delivered record sales which beat last years exceptional sales levels, growing 4% in the quarter and 82% compared to two years ago. We also grew market share in the majority of our key product categories, said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and chief executive officer. We are confirming our full year outlook, despite unprecedented supply chain industry challenges. I am excited about the long-term growth potential of Logitech.

* Its 3 year net income to common stockholders growth rate is now at 115.87%.

* The 2 year cash and equivalents growth rate now stands at 11.47%.

* Its 2 year net cashflow from operations growth rate is now at 22.74%.

* LOGI's revenue has moved up $3,550,043,000 over the prior 52 months.

See below:
https://imgur.com/oLigSPJ
(https://stocknews.com/stock/LOGI/)

**Dividend:**
* Logitech pays a growing 1.12% yield, which is considered very safe.

* As mentioned before they posted a negative cash flow for the quarter due to ad-spend and R&amp;D, not weakness. The balance sheet is an absolute fortress (marketbeat.com).

* The company net-cash with very low leverage and ample coverage. Hence no fear of dividend cut or suspension. It also gives reason to think there will be another dividend increase next year. Logitech pays out annually, and only recently made the last distribution.

**The Dip:**
* Logitech has declined this year following supply shortages and a Q2 result miss (which there are logical reasons for.)

* Logitech is down 15% this year. It sells for 15 times earnings, its normal multiple in the past decade has been 23. It hasnt been a bad year for Logitech. Revenue in the past year was up 51% and earnings were up more than 32%.

* The stock peaked in June at about $138 and has fallen to the $80-range.
Critics say the company has spent excessively on marketing. Profit margins have shrunk.
However, based on Logitechs long term record, I think it is a good play.

**The Growing PC Gaming Accessories Market:**

* Advance Market Analytics published a new research publication on PC Gaming Accessories Market Insights, to 2026 with 232 pages and enriched with self-explained Tables and charts in presentable format. In the Study you will find new evolving Trends, Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities generated by targeting market associated stakeholders. The growth of the PC Gaming Accessories Market was mainly driven by the increasing R&amp;D spending across the world.

* Controllers, gamepads, keyboards, cameras, virtual reality headsets, and other gaming peripherals are included in the category of gaming accessories. The global demand for gaming accessories has increased in recent years due to the rising usage of PCs. Furthermore, innovations such as virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) have aided the worldwide gaming accessory markets expansion.

**Is Logitech a bargain right now?:**

I found an interesting article (after discarding many during my research) analysing if Logitech is currently a cheap stock, Ive quoted the important parts below:

* Logitech, which makes input and interface devices for personal computers and electronics such as keyboards, computer mice, bluetooth speakers and universal remotes, saw its share price more than double over 2020, with the good times continuing over the first half of this year. But the stock has fallen on hard times of late, dropping 37 per cent since early June.

* Appealing to the companys significant runway ahead, however, David Driscoll (Portfolio Manager) named LOGI one of his Top Picks for the next 12 months while speaking on a BNN Bloomberg segment on Friday.

* Weve spoken about companies that have fallen more than 20 per cent from their highs despite the fact that the revenue growth and profit growth is there. The reason [Logitech] has fallen as much as it has from its high price of 124 Swiss francs to where it is at 82 is simply because of the COVID variant lockdowns, Driscoll said.

* Youre not getting people out there in the gaming industry having competitions and people showing up at movie theatres to watch it, said Driscoll, President and CEO of Liberty International Investment Management. 

* This company makes computer mice and the trackballs, game controllers, keyboards, video cameras and multimedia speakers. So, the long term outlook for the company is very strong because, again, video gaming is going to be a thing of the future, he said.

* The stock trades at 13x earnings so its very cheap right now. Dividends have been rising by ten per cent a year and free cash flow yields are around ten per cent relative to where bond yields are. And then when we look at the return on capital of 46 per cent versus the cost of capital at eight per cent it certainly gives Logitech a great opportunity to raise the dividends and innovate and to spend on research and development for the future, he said.
So, I just think where we are at its very cheap stock, Driscoll said.

* Weve started strong in Fiscal Year 2022, with Q1 sales up 58 per cent in constant currency and profits doubling versus last year, said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and CEO, in a July 26 press release. Our key categories grew high double digits. This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.

* With Logitechs fiscal fourth quarter results in April, the company announced both an increase to its share buyback program bringing it to up to $1 billion and a dividend increase of ten per cent, saying the two moves show the companys continued commitment to consistently return cash to shareholders.

**What makes Logitech a good buy?:**

I dislike the Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha, but I havent found any other good research for this section. Take (some of)this section with a grain of salt as Im using them as my sources. If you feel like it skip past the Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha section to see my own analysis and what Ive wrote from other sources. But so far the Fool/SA articles seem to be a rare gem on them and Im getting useful information. Ive mixed a decent amount of my own opinion/writing in (it isnt just paraphrased).

* Logitech is still seeing high demand for webcams, keyboards, and gaming products.
It's gaining market share in secular growth categories like gaming.
The stock is trading at cheap levels, despite a long runway of growth ahead.

*Takeaways from earnings report:*

* Logitechs sales were up 58% year over year, while its operating profit more than doubled.
 In a statement, CEO Bracken Darrell said, ""This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.""

See below:
https://imgur.com/UbNXJZA

(IMAGE SOURCE: LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL'S FISCAL Q1 2022 EARNINGS PRESENTATION.)

* The global market for webcams was estimated at $6.1 billion in 2019 (according to Grand View Research.)According to an analysis published in May 2020, its expect to grow at a compound annual rate of 8% through 2027

* In a similar report on gaming peripherals, the market was estimated at $3.9 billion in 2019, and forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.4% through 2025.

* Investors now seem overly concerned about a near-term deceleration in growth as the company begins to lap periods when demand spiked for its products during the pandemic. But investors should base their view of Logitech as an investment on the long-term opportunities in front of it. As Darrell said on the earnings call, ""We have an exciting long-term growth potential ahead from this bigger [sales] base.""

*Gaining market share:*

* While riding trends in remote work and gaming, Logitech is also gaining market share.
It is the leader in most categories it operates in (important ones to note are webcams for cam girls and web conferencing, keyboards, mouses, sim racing, flight sims, other gaming peripherals)

* Market share gains are difficult to come by during pandemic due to supply shortages.
But with supply catching up to demand, Logitech reported share gains across most categories last quarter.
Logitech has gained market share in gaming, where sales increased by 76% on a currency-neutral basis.

* Darrell said that Logitech's marketing around gaming is ""probably the best we've had."" ...having seen this statement Im going to write a section on their marketing, to see whats up.

* Logitechs PC peripherals business grew 49% year over year, products that have been on the market for 2 years are still driving sales, including the MX Master 3 mouse and MX keys keyboard.

*Demand is high for hybrid solutions:*

* The growth of Logitechs webcam business (lmao camgirls and zoom) supports Logitech management's belief that the pandemic has forever changed the workplace. 
* Darrell suggested that some people may find it awkward to do audio-only calls in the future. The company's 73% sales growth in webcams implies that the need for hybrid solutions in the office will continue to support demand of Logitechs products 
* The installed base of PCs is estimated at 1.4 billion, which gives Logitech a massive market in which to grow sales for many years. ""[W]e think the opportunity there is very significant, and we're going to keep investing,"" Darrell said. 

*Secular opportunities to drive long-term growth:*

* Logitech listed four secular growth trends at its investor day held in March this year: the growth of remote work, the transition from audio toward video calls, video gaming as a spectator sport, and the spike in streaming and content creation.

* Logitech expects these trends to create new opportunities such as:
Workspaces will have to be upgraded, as workers move to remote, or a hybrid model that includes remote and the office.

* As a result, employees/organizations can be expected to invest more money into peripherals such as keyboards, mice, tablets, and speakers, among other items. all of which Logitech is a market leader in.
 
* This just reminded me Ive been buying logitech speakers for a long time, theyve always been great as a budget option for this category. I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. Im a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. Ive now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone as a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if youre a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...youve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? Ive generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever. I like this paragraph so Im going to copy it as the intro. Sorry for making you re-read it, but its relevant to this section.

* This investment by organisations into peripherals would spark a refresh cycle and likely increase demand of Logitechs products (eg pointing devices, keyboards, and tablet accessories.
Logitech, from my personal impression, is a leader in the webcam sector. Cam girls all use the C920, and now students, teachers, office workers etc are all buying the C920 and others for video calls. 
The shift to video calls due to the pandemic means that demand for video collaboration equipment and webcams is likely to increase.

* Third-party research estimates the webcam market will grow at an annual pace of 16.6% through 2026 and hit $24.6 billion in value. The videoconferencing market is also expected to clock double-digit growth over the long run.

* This is a good sign for logitech, as video collab equipment and webcams produced more than 28% of its revenue last year.

* The video gaming market is also driving sales for Logitech/the need for new equipment, due to the growing adoption of esports (Im paraphrasing here, but I think Motley Fool forgot normal gamers here, a lot of us have been upgrading our PCs, mouses, keyboards, microphones.).

* According to third-party estimates, the global esports market could clock 15% annual growth through 2026. This would encourage gamers to invest more money into the latest equipment, unlocking another solid opportunity for Logitech.

* Due to catalysts including esports, online education and other forms of content creation (eg Twitch, Youtube, Camgirls), the video streaming market is anticipated to grow at 21% a year through to 2028 according to Grand View Research.

* So it is safe to say that Logitech is sitting on a bunch of impressive growth drivers that could help the company deliver eye-popping results in the long run.
* As such, investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolio shouldn't delay further. Logitech's recent pullback has made the stock cheap, with its price-to-sales ratio of 3.96 falling below last year's average multiple of 4.5. The earnings multiple of 22 is also below the 2020 average of 24.6. A strong earnings report could kick-start Logitech stock's rally, which is why now looks like a good time to go long. &lt;- this is as of Jul 17 so outdated info, please check elsewhere in this DD for more recent info.

*Logitech is an attractive opportunity now:*

* ""Logitech is very undervalued at current levels.""

* ""The company has a superb track record of beating earnings estimates.""

* ""We think current price levels are attractive for long-term investors. However, we'd like to see a trend reversal before jumping in.""

*Growth Catalysts:*

* Video games. The average time spent playing video games is projected to increase from 1.1 hours per person per day to 1.5 hours during the next 5 years. (https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/7dbf4906-4a13-47f9-9a4c-f7898ff6d1b4)

* Reddit brings this to an average of 3-24 hours. You fucking degenerates. 

* This can be attributed to 2 factors. The first one is that video games are becoming increasingly social. The second one is thanks to the rise of eSports which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2019 to 2024. (https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/)

* The second catalyst is the content market which is expected to see growth of 13% CAGR from 2021 to 2026. This includes industries such as movies, music, education, and others. (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-content-market-size-usd-397-390-million-by-2026-at-cagr-13--valuates-reports-301187341.htm)
CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

*Valuation:*

* ""The intrinsic value has dropped a little to $124 per share. However, at the current price, there is finally a good margin of safety for Logitech.

*Potential Short-Term Catalysts and Risks:*

* Logitech share price has been falling for several months, this is likely due to the expectation that the boost from the pandemic will disappear and growth will decline temporarily.
Current price may be too pessimistic, especially when considering that it is already undervalued even with the expected decline in growth.

* Logitech tends to beat earnings estimates often.
Keep in mind that recent larger beats could be due to pandemic boost. The company may face bigger headwinds than anticipated going forward. 

* However if the trend of beating earnings continues, it could give the stock a push upwards.
(Ive covered this later in the DD) Logitech is unlikely to be immune from supply chain issues that have impacted a large number of companies around the world. 

* This is an important risk to consider, especially as Logitech is largely pushing hardware products. If Logitech were to announce its inventory has been impacted, it is very possible that the stock would tumble even if they beat on expectations. Note: I think this might very well be the explanation for the current price at the $80 range, read my segment on supply chain issues later in the DD.

*Final thoughts on this section:*


* Logitech is significantly more attractive today than it was back in July. Long-term investors could potentially consider entering at these prices. However, we rate it a hold because its stock price is still on a short-term downtrend and would like to see the trend reverse before entering. (Oct 12, 2021)
 
**How Logitech is benefiting from the work from home revolution:**

* Logitechs share of the global computer peripheral equipment market grew from 0.6% in calendar 2019 to 1.0% in calendar 2020.

* The permanent shifts in where people work and how they spend their free time may have created a new, larger base for Logitechs sales.

Logitechs largest segments are projected to grow at much faster rates than the rest of the computer peripherals market.

* The firm is well positioned to continue to profit from growth in gaming and work from home:
the shift to work from home (WFH) will support elevated profits going forward
its strong position in the gaming peripherals industry, which is expected to grow 10% compounded annually through 2025

* The firms history of profitable growth.

* The current valuation already implies profits fall 32% (Oct 11, 2021)

**Intro:**
Ive been buying logitech speakers and other products for a long time, theyve always been great as a budget option for this category. I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. Im a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. Ive now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone back when I was a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if youre a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...youve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? Ive generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever.

Todays pop was likely caused by a Citi Analyst raising their price target, thank you to /u/yoyo248 for pointing this out:

* ""@algobotnews
Logitech risk/reward offers 'very attractive opportunity,' says Citi""

https://twitter.com/algobotnews/status/1461291610923311109

*Logitech International SA is a holding company, which engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of peripherals for PCs, tablets, and other digital platforms. Its products include mice, keyboards, presentation remotes, headsets, and speakers. The firm offers solutions for healthy computing, wireless charging, streaming, virtual reality, rom home, schools, healthcare, and software and apps. Its brands include Logitech, Jaybird, Ultimate Ears, Logitech G, ASTRO Gaming, and Blue Microphones. The company was founded by Daniel Borel, Pierluigi Zappacosta, and Giacamo Marini on October 2, 1981 and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland (marketbeat.com)*

**The below DD uses multiple sources, which I will reference at the bottom. Sorry Im not using Harvard referencing, but my Physics papers have made me sick to death of that so Im only doing a bibliography. Please PM me if you want this since Reddit blocks a few of the links:**

**Logitech is referenced as a good post-pandemic play, for a variety of reasons:**
* The company is benefiting from COVID trends, but also secular trends (A secular trend or market is one that is likely to continue moving in the same general direction for the foreseeable future. ... The secular movement of a long-term trend can be neutral (flat), positive, or negative in its direction.).

* It is sustaining YOY growth, paying a very safe dividend (in my research it is strongly recommended as a dividend stock). The company is investing in the future (ill get onto this later).
Operations are within target, theres strong cash flow and free cash flow.

* Logitech had a great quarter (despite rising costs, material shortfalls and margin pressure). On a two year basis, revenue is up more than 82%. No doubt due to the gaming boom during the pandemic. 
It is said that logitech is underperforming in cams, tablet accessories, video and headsets (which all saw high-double-digit growth last year). Which Im surprised to see, as Im friends with some cam girls, and the device of choice in that industry is and always has been the Logitech C920 webcam. Maybe a surge of Pandemic cam girls will offset this (in all seriousness lol, great brand loyalty to Logitech there).

* They are delivering strength in keyboards, pointers and gaming equipment. Which doesnt surprise me. Ive been doing flight sims and sim racing for a long time. On the low to mid end, Logitech has been my choice and the recommended choice for flight sticks and sim wheels. Logitech is killing it in the low/mid end sim racing market. 

**Earnings:**
* Operating income, both GAAP and adjusted, fell 40% but largely due to a 60% increase in marketing and 30% increase in R&amp;D. Which are acceptable reasons, as they should result in higher sales long-term. 

* The company reaffirmed its guidance for revenue and earnings at the previously stated range.  This is calling for full-year growth in the range of flat to +/- 5% which we view as a wide range given this years YTD strength. The comps are going to get tougher before they get easy again but the two strongest quarters of the fiscal year are still ahead. In our view, Logitech should produce at least flat to slightly higher YOY revenue if not growth in the mid-single-digit range. (https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/logitech-is-still-a-logical-choice-for-dividend-growth-portfolios/?focus=NASDAQ:LOGI)

* In Q2, adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share fell short of the consensus estimate of $1.10 per share. The company reported earnings of $1.56 per share in the prior-year period.

* However, revenues of $1.31 billion were up 4% from the previous years quarter and surpassed the Streets estimates of $1.27 billion.
 * Notably, Logitech reaffirmed its guidance for Fiscal 2022. The company expects flat sales growth in constant currency with a probable variation of nearly 5%. Further, it expects to report adjusted operating income in the range of $800 million to $850 million.
(https://www.tipranks.com/news/logitech-posts-mixed-fiscal-q2-results/)

* Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell commented, In Q2 we delivered record sales which beat last years exceptional sales levels, growing 4% in the quarter and 82% compared to two years ago. We also grew market share in the majority of our key product categories.
Looking forward, he added We are confirming our full year outlook, despite unprecedented supply chain industry challenges. I am excited about the long-term growth potential of Logitech.

**Q2 Sales:**

* Q2 sales were $1.31 billion, up 4 percent in US dollars and 2 percent in constant currency, compared to Q2 of the prior year.

* Q2 GAAP operating income declined 44 percent to $179 million, compared to $322 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q2 GAAP earnings per share (EPS) declined 48 percent to $0.81, compared to $1.56 in the same quarter a year ago.
* Q2 non-GAAP operating income declined 40 percent to $211 million, compared to $354 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q2 non-GAAP EPS declined 44 percent to $1.05, compared to $1.87 in the same quarter a year ago.

* In Q2 we delivered record sales which beat last years exceptional sales levels, growing 4% in the quarter and 82% compared to two years ago. We also grew market share in the majority of our key product categories, said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and chief executive officer. We are confirming our full year outlook, despite unprecedented supply chain industry challenges. I am excited about the long-term growth potential of Logitech.
(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211025005827/en/Logitech-Delivers-Record-Q2-Sales)

* Its 3 year net income to common stockholders growth rate is now at 115.87%.

* The 2 year cash and equivalents growth rate now stands at 11.47%.

* Its 2 year net cashflow from operations growth rate is now at 22.74%.

* LOGI's revenue has moved up $3,550,043,000 over the prior 52 months.

See below:
https://imgur.com/oLigSPJ
(https://stocknews.com/stock/LOGI/)

**Dividend:**
* Logitech pays a growing 1.12% yield, which is considered very safe.

* As mentioned before they posted a negative cash flow for the quarter due to ad-spend and R&amp;D, not weakness. The balance sheet is an absolute fortress (marketbeat.com).

* The company net-cash with very low leverage and ample coverage. Hence no fear of dividend cut or suspension. It also gives reason to think there will be another dividend increase next year. Logitech pays out annually, and only recently made the last distribution.

**The Dip:**
* Logitech has declined this year following supply shortages and a Q2 result miss (which there are logical reasons for.)

* Logitech is down 15% this year. It sells for 15 times earnings, its normal multiple in the past decade has been 23. It hasnt been a bad year for Logitech. Revenue in the past year was up 51% and earnings were up more than 32%.

* The stock peaked in June at about $138 and has fallen to the $80-range.
Critics say the company has spent excessively on marketing. Profit margins have shrunk.
However, based on Logitechs long term record, I think it is a good play.

**The Growing PC Gaming Accessories Market:**

* Advance Market Analytics published a new research publication on PC Gaming Accessories Market Insights, to 2026 with 232 pages and enriched with self-explained Tables and charts in presentable format. In the Study you will find new evolving Trends, Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities generated by targeting market associated stakeholders. The growth of the PC Gaming Accessories Market was mainly driven by the increasing R&amp;D spending across the world.

* Controllers, gamepads, keyboards, cameras, virtual reality headsets, and other gaming peripherals are included in the category of gaming accessories. The global demand for gaming accessories has increased in recent years due to the rising usage of PCs. Furthermore, innovations such as virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) have aided the worldwide gaming accessory markets expansion.

* Ive requested a report sample from the market research companies that publish it. Ill update the DD later with it:

* Im going to update this with some of my own research later, as well as my findings from this report if they send me it. I requested a section relevant to Logitech. Using my student cred to hopefully get them to send me it even though Im not a professional. 

**Is Logitech a bargain right now?:**

I found an interesting article (after discarding many during my research) analysing if Logitech is currently a cheap stock, Ive quoted the important parts below:

* Logitech, which makes input and interface devices for personal computers and electronics such as keyboards, computer mice, bluetooth speakers and universal remotes, saw its share price more than double over 2020, with the good times continuing over the first half of this year. But the stock has fallen on hard times of late, dropping 37 per cent since early June.

* Appealing to the companys significant runway ahead, however, David Driscoll (Portfolio Manager) named LOGI one of his Top Picks for the next 12 months while speaking on a BNN Bloomberg segment on Friday.

* Weve spoken about companies that have fallen more than 20 per cent from their highs despite the fact that the revenue growth and profit growth is there. The reason [Logitech] has fallen as much as it has from its high price of 124 Swiss francs to where it is at 82 is simply because of the COVID variant lockdowns, Driscoll said.

* Youre not getting people out there in the gaming industry having competitions and people showing up at movie theatres to watch it, said Driscoll, President and CEO of Liberty International Investment Management. 

* This company makes computer mice and the trackballs, game controllers, keyboards, video cameras and multimedia speakers. So, the long term outlook for the company is very strong because, again, video gaming is going to be a thing of the future, he said.

* The stock trades at 13x earnings so its very cheap right now. Dividends have been rising by ten per cent a year and free cash flow yields are around ten per cent relative to where bond yields are. And then when we look at the return on capital of 46 per cent versus the cost of capital at eight per cent it certainly gives Logitech a great opportunity to raise the dividends and innovate and to spend on research and development for the future, he said.
So, I just think where we are at its very cheap stock, Driscoll said.

* Weve started strong in Fiscal Year 2022, with Q1 sales up 58 per cent in constant currency and profits doubling versus last year, said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and CEO, in a July 26 press release. Our key categories grew high double digits. This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.

* With Logitechs fiscal fourth quarter results in April, the company announced both an increase to its share buyback program bringing it to up to $1 billion and a dividend increase of ten per cent, saying the two moves show the companys continued commitment to consistently return cash to shareholders.

**What makes Logitech a good buy?:**

I dislike the Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha, but I havent found any other good research for this section. Take (some of)this section with a grain of salt as Im using them as my sources. If you feel like it skip past the Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha section to see my own analysis and what Ive wrote from other sources. But so far the Fool/SA articles seem to be a rare gem on them and Im getting useful information. Ive mixed a decent amount of my own opinion/writing in (it isnt just paraphrased).

* Logitech is still seeing high demand for webcams, keyboards, and gaming products.
It's gaining market share in secular growth categories like gaming.
The stock is trading at cheap levels, despite a long runway of growth ahead.

*Takeaways from earnings report:*

* Logitechs sales were up 58% year over year, while its operating profit more than doubled.
 In a statement, CEO Bracken Darrell said, ""This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.""

See below:
https://imgur.com/UbNXJZA

(IMAGE SOURCE: LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL'S FISCAL Q1 2022 EARNINGS PRESENTATION.)

* The global market for webcams was estimated at $6.1 billion in 2019 (according to Grand View Research.)According to an analysis published in May 2020, its expect to grow at a compound annual rate of 8% through 2027

* In a similar report on gaming peripherals, the market was estimated at $3.9 billion in 2019, and forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.4% through 2025.

* Investors now seem overly concerned about a near-term deceleration in growth as the company begins to lap periods when demand spiked for its products during the pandemic. But investors should base their view of Logitech as an investment on the long-term opportunities in front of it. As Darrell said on the earnings call, ""We have an exciting long-term growth potential ahead from this bigger [sales] base.""

*Gaining market share:*

* While riding trends in remote work and gaming, Logitech is also gaining market share.
It is the leader in most categories it operates in (important ones to note are webcams for cam girls and web conferencing, keyboards, mouses, sim racing, flight sims, other gaming peripherals)

* Market share gains are difficult to come by during pandemic due to supply shortages.
But with supply catching up to demand, Logitech reported share gains across most categories last quarter.
Logitech has gained market share in gaming, where sales increased by 76% on a currency-neutral basis.

* Darrell said that Logitech's marketing around gaming is ""probably the best we've had."" ...having seen this statement Im going to write a section on their marketing, to see whats up.

* Logitechs PC peripherals business grew 49% year over year, products that have been on the market for 2 years are still driving sales, including the MX Master 3 mouse and MX keys keyboard.

*Demand is high for hybrid solutions:*

* The growth of Logitechs webcam business (lmao camgirls and zoom) supports Logitech management's belief that the pandemic has forever changed the workplace. 
* Darrell suggested that some people may find it awkward to do audio-only calls in the future. The company's 73% sales growth in webcams implies that the need for hybrid solutions in the office will continue to support demand of Logitechs products 
* The installed base of PCs is estimated at 1.4 billion, which gives Logitech a massive market in which to grow sales for many years. ""[W]e think the opportunity there is very significant, and we're going to keep investing,"" Darrell said. 

*Secular opportunities to drive long-term growth:*

* Logitech listed four secular growth trends at its investor day held in March this year: the growth of remote work, the transition from audio toward video calls, video gaming as a spectator sport, and the spike in streaming and content creation.

* Logitech expects these trends to create new opportunities such as:
Workspaces will have to be upgraded, as workers move to remote, or a hybrid model that includes remote and the office.

* As a result, employees/organizations can be expected to invest more money into peripherals such as keyboards, mice, tablets, and speakers, among other items. all of which Logitech is a market leader in.
 
* This just reminded me Ive been buying logitech speakers for a long time, theyve always been great as a budget option for this category. I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. Im a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. Ive now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone as a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if youre a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...youve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? Ive generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever. I like this paragraph so Im going to copy it as the intro. Sorry for making you re-read it, but its relevant to this section.

* This investment by organisations into peripherals would spark a refresh cycle and likely increase demand of Logitechs products (eg pointing devices, keyboards, and tablet accessories.
Logitech, from my personal impression, is a leader in the webcam sector. Cam girls all use the C920, and now students, teachers, office workers etc are all buying the C920 and others for video calls. 
The shift to video calls due to the pandemic means that demand for video collaboration equipment and webcams is likely to increase.

* Third-party research estimates the webcam market will grow at an annual pace of 16.6% through 2026 and hit $24.6 billion in value. The videoconferencing market is also expected to clock double-digit growth over the long run.

* This is a good sign for logitech, as video collab equipment and webcams produced more than 28% of its revenue last year.

* The video gaming market is also driving sales for Logitech/the need for new equipment, due to the growing adoption of esports (Im paraphrasing here, but I think Motley Fool forgot normal gamers here, a lot of us have been upgrading our PCs, mouses, keyboards, microphones.).

* According to third-party estimates, the global esports market could clock 15% annual growth through 2026. This would encourage gamers to invest more money into the latest equipment, unlocking another solid opportunity for Logitech.

* Due to catalysts including esports, online education and other forms of content creation (eg Twitch, Youtube, Camgirls), the video streaming market is anticipated to grow at 21% a year through to 2028 according to Grand View Research.

* So it is safe to say that Logitech is sitting on a bunch of impressive growth drivers that could help the company deliver eye-popping results in the long run.
* As such, investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolio shouldn't delay further. Logitech's recent pullback has made the stock cheap, with its price-to-sales ratio of 3.96 falling below last year's average multiple of 4.5. The earnings multiple of 22 is also below the 2020 average of 24.6. A strong earnings report could kick-start Logitech stock's rally, which is why now looks like a good time to go long. &lt;- this is as of Jul 17 so outdated info, please check elsewhere in this DD for more recent info.

*Logitech is an attractive opportunity now:*

* ""Logitech is very undervalued at current levels.""

* ""The company has a superb track record of beating earnings estimates.""

* ""We think current price levels are attractive for long-term investors. However, we'd like to see a trend reversal before jumping in.""

*Growth Catalysts:*

* Video games. The average time spent playing video games is projected to increase from 1.1 hours per person per day to 1.5 hours during the next 5 years. (https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/7dbf4906-4a13-47f9-9a4c-f7898ff6d1b4)

* Reddit brings this to an average of 3-24 hours. You fucking degenerates. 

* This can be attributed to 2 factors. The first one is that video games are becoming increasingly social. The second one is thanks to the rise of eSports which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2019 to 2024. (https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/)

* The second catalyst is the content market which is expected to see growth of 13% CAGR from 2021 to 2026. This includes industries such as movies, music, education, and others. (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-content-market-size-usd-397-390-million-by-2026-at-cagr-13--valuates-reports-301187341.htm)
CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

*Valuation:*

* ""The intrinsic value has dropped a little to $124 per share. However, at the current price, there is finally a good margin of safety for Logitech.

*Potential Short-Term Catalysts and Risks:*

* Logitech share price has been falling for several months, this is likely due to the expectation that the boost from the pandemic will disappear and growth will decline temporarily.
Current price may be too pessimistic, especially when considering that it is already undervalued even with the expected decline in growth.

* Logitech tends to beat earnings estimates often.
Keep in mind that recent larger beats could be due to pandemic boost. The company may face bigger headwinds than anticipated going forward. 

* However if the trend of beating earnings continues, it could give the stock a push upwards.
(Ive covered this later in the DD) Logitech is unlikely to be immune from supply chain issues that have impacted a large number of companies around the world. 

* This is an important risk to consider, especially as Logitech is largely pushing hardware products. If Logitech were to announce its inventory has been impacted, it is very possible that the stock would tumble even if they beat on expectations. Note: I think this might very well be the explanation for the current price at the $80 range, read my segment on supply chain issues later in the DD.

*Final thoughts on this section:*


* Logitech is significantly more attractive today than it was back in July. Long-term investors could potentially consider entering at these prices. However, we rate it a hold because its stock price is still on a short-term downtrend and would like to see the trend reverse before entering. (Oct 12, 2021)
 
**How Logitech is benefiting from the work from home revolution:**

* Logitechs share of the global computer peripheral equipment market grew from 0.6% in calendar 2019 to 1.0% in calendar 2020.

* The permanent shifts in where people work and how they spend their free time may have created a new, larger base for Logitechs sales.

Logitechs largest segments are projected to grow at much faster rates than the rest of the computer peripherals market.

* The firm is well positioned to continue to profit from growth in gaming and work from home:
the shift to work from home (WFH) will support elevated profits going forward
its strong position in the gaming peripherals industry, which is expected to grow 10% compounded annually through 2025

* The firms history of profitable growth.

* The current valuation already implies profits fall 32% (Oct 11, 2021)

1. Where do you obtain the right size of jar? 
I have often wondered how large your stock jar needs to be when you start to trade lots of stock. Cant seem to find anything of the right dimensions. 

2. How long should you keep your stock before getting rid of it ? (What I assume is pump and dump). 
I dont think stock keeps very long ? The market seems to always want to trade more stock but I imagine the price of stock goes down when it spoils. Is a freezer a viable solution ?

3. Is the stock exchange a real place ?
How often/where/when do you guys get together to exchange the stock ? Is it like a community meet-up ? I searched for Wall Street on maps but its kind of far from my country. I hope there are international chapters so I too can exchange stock with you guys.

* The company is benefiting from COVID trends, but also secular trends (A secular trend or market is one that is likely to continue moving in the same general direction for the foreseeable future. ... The secular movement of a long-term trend can be neutral (flat), positive, or negative in its direction.).

* It is sustaining YOY growth, paying a very safe dividend (in my research it is strongly recommended as a dividend stock). The company is investing in the future (ill get onto this later).
Operations are within target, theres strong cash flow and free cash flow.

* Logitech had a great quarter (despite rising costs, material shortfalls and margin pressure). On a two year basis, revenue is up more than 82%. No doubt due to the gaming boom during the pandemic. 
It is said that logitech is underperforming in cams, tablet accessories, video and headsets (which all saw high-double-digit growth last year). Which Im surprised to see, as Im friends with some cam girls, and the device of choice in that industry is and always has been the Logitech C920 webcam. Maybe a surge of Pandemic cam girls will offset this (in all seriousness lol, great brand loyalty to Logitech there).

* They are delivering strength in keyboards, pointers and gaming equipment. Which doesnt surprise me. Ive been doing flight sims and sim racing for a long time. On the low to mid end, Logitech has been my choice and the recommended choice for flight sticks and sim wheels. Logitech is killing it in the low/mid end sim racing market. 

**Earnings:**
* The companys AGM shark by 370 basis points due to higher cost of goods sold (freight, materials and labor costs) but remained within the companies long-term target range. Operating income, both GAAP and adjusted, fell 40% but largely due to a 60% increase in marketing and 30% increase in R&amp;D. Which are acceptable reasons, as they should result in higher sales long-term. 

* The company reaffirmed its guidance for revenue and earnings at the previously stated range.  This is calling for full-year growth in the range of flat to +/- 5% which we view as a wide range given this years YTD strength. The comps are going to get tougher before they get easy again but the two strongest quarters of the fiscal year are still ahead. In our view, Logitech should produce at least flat to slightly higher YOY revenue if not growth in the mid-single-digit range. (https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/logitech-is-still-a-logical-choice-for-dividend-growth-portfolios/?focus=NASDAQ:LOGI)

* In Q2, adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share fell short of the consensus estimate of $1.10 per share. The company reported earnings of $1.56 per share in the prior-year period.

* However, revenues of $1.31 billion were up 4% from the previous years quarter and surpassed the Streets estimates of $1.27 billion.
 * Notably, Logitech reaffirmed its guidance for Fiscal 2022. The company expects flat sales growth in constant currency with a probable variation of nearly 5%. Further, it expects to report adjusted operating income in the range of $800 million to $850 million.
(https://www.tipranks.com/news/logitech-posts-mixed-fiscal-q2-results/)

* Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell commented, In Q2 we delivered record sales which beat last years exceptional sales levels, growing 4% in the quarter and 82% compared to two years ago. We also grew market share in the majority of our key product categories.
Looking forward, he added We are confirming our full year outlook, despite unprecedented supply chain industry challenges. I am excited about the long-term growth potential of Logitech.

**Q2 Sales:**

* Q2 sales were $1.31 billion, up 4 percent in US dollars and 2 percent in constant currency, compared to Q2 of the prior year.

* Q2 GAAP operating income declined 44 percent to $179 million, compared to $322 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q2 GAAP earnings per share (EPS) declined 48 percent to $0.81, compared to $1.56 in the same quarter a year ago.
* Q2 non-GAAP operating income declined 40 percent to $211 million, compared to $354 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q2 non-GAAP EPS declined 44 percent to $1.05, compared to $1.87 in the same quarter a year ago.

* In Q2 we delivered record sales which beat last years exceptional sales levels, growing 4% in the quarter and 82% compared to two years ago. We also grew market share in the majority of our key product categories, said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and chief executive officer. We are confirming our full year outlook, despite unprecedented supply chain industry challenges. I am excited about the long-term growth potential of Logitech.

* Its 3 year net income to common stockholders growth rate is now at 115.87%.

* The 2 year cash and equivalents growth rate now stands at 11.47%.

* Its 2 year net cashflow from operations growth rate is now at 22.74%.

* LOGI's revenue has moved up $3,550,043,000 over the prior 52 months.

(https://stocknews.com/stock/LOGI/)

**Dividend:**
* Logitech pays a growing 1.12% yield, which is considered very safe.

* As mentioned before they posted a negative cash flow for the quarter due to ad-spend and R&amp;D, not weakness. The balance sheet is an absolute fortress (marketbeat.com).

* The company net-cash with very low leverage and ample coverage. Hence no fear of dividend cut or suspension. It also gives reason to think there will be another dividend increase next year. Logitech pays out annually, and only recently made the last distribution.

**The Dip:**
* Logitech has declined this year following supply shortages and a Q2 result miss (which there are logical reasons for.)

* Logitech is down 15% this year. It sells for 15 times earnings, its normal multiple in the past decade has been 23. It hasnt been a bad year for Logitech. Revenue in the past year was up 51% and earnings were up more than 32%.

* The stock peaked in June at about $138 and has fallen to the $80-range.
Critics say the company has spent excessively on marketing. Profit margins have shrunk.
However, based on Logitechs long term record, I think it is a good play.

**The Growing PC Gaming Accessories Market:**

* Advance Market Analytics published a new research publication on PC Gaming Accessories Market Insights, to 2026 with 232 pages and enriched with self-explained Tables and charts in presentable format. In the Study you will find new evolving Trends, Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities generated by targeting market associated stakeholders. The growth of the PC Gaming Accessories Market was mainly driven by the increasing R&amp;D spending across the world.

* Controllers, gamepads, keyboards, cameras, virtual reality headsets, and other gaming peripherals are included in the category of gaming accessories. The global demand for gaming accessories has increased in recent years due to the rising usage of PCs. Furthermore, innovations such as virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) have aided the worldwide gaming accessory markets expansion.

**Is Logitech a bargain right now?:**

I found an interesting article (after discarding many during my research) analysing if Logitech is currently a cheap stock, Ive quoted the important parts below:

* Logitech, which makes input and interface devices for personal computers and electronics such as keyboards, computer mice, bluetooth speakers and universal remotes, saw its share price more than double over 2020, with the good times continuing over the first half of this year. But the stock has fallen on hard times of late, dropping 37 per cent since early June.

* Appealing to the companys significant runway ahead, however, David Driscoll (Portfolio Manager) named LOGI one of his Top Picks for the next 12 months while speaking on a BNN Bloomberg segment on Friday.

* Weve spoken about companies that have fallen more than 20 per cent from their highs despite the fact that the revenue growth and profit growth is there. The reason [Logitech] has fallen as much as it has from its high price of 124 Swiss francs to where it is at 82 is simply because of the COVID variant lockdowns, Driscoll said.

* Youre not getting people out there in the gaming industry having competitions and people showing up at movie theatres to watch it, said Driscoll, President and CEO of Liberty International Investment Management. 

* This company makes computer mice and the trackballs, game controllers, keyboards, video cameras and multimedia speakers. So, the long term outlook for the company is very strong because, again, video gaming is going to be a thing of the future, he said.

* The stock trades at 13x earnings so its very cheap right now. Dividends have been rising by ten per cent a year and free cash flow yields are around ten per cent relative to where bond yields are. And then when we look at the return on capital of 46 per cent versus the cost of capital at eight per cent it certainly gives Logitech a great opportunity to raise the dividends and innovate and to spend on research and development for the future, he said.
So, I just think where we are at its very cheap stock, Driscoll said.

* Weve started strong in Fiscal Year 2022, with Q1 sales up 58 per cent in constant currency and profits doubling versus last year, said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and CEO, in a July 26 press release. Our key categories grew high double digits. This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.

* With Logitechs fiscal fourth quarter results in April, the company announced both an increase to its share buyback program bringing it to up to $1 billion and a dividend increase of ten per cent, saying the two moves show the companys continued commitment to consistently return cash to shareholders.

**What makes Logitech a good buy?:**

I dislike the Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha, but I havent found any other good research for this section. Take (some of)this section with a grain of salt as Im using them as my sources. If you feel like it skip past the Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha section to see my own analysis and what Ive wrote from other sources. But so far the Fool/SA articles seem to be a rare gem on them and Im getting useful information. Ive mixed a decent amount of my own opinion/writing in (it isnt just paraphrased).

* Logitech is still seeing high demand for webcams, keyboards, and gaming products.
It's gaining market share in secular growth categories like gaming.
The stock is trading at cheap levels, despite a long runway of growth ahead.

*Takeaways from earnings report:*

* Logitechs sales were up 58% year over year, while its operating profit more than doubled.
 In a statement, CEO Bracken Darrell said, ""This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.""

See below:
https://imgur.com/UbNXJZA

(IMAGE SOURCE: LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL'S FISCAL Q1 2022 EARNINGS PRESENTATION.)

* The global market for webcams was estimated at $6.1 billion in 2019 (according to Grand View Research.)According to an analysis published in May 2020, its expect to grow at a compound annual rate of 8% through 2027

* In a similar report on gaming peripherals, the market was estimated at $3.9 billion in 2019, and forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.4% through 2025.

* Investors now seem overly concerned about a near-term deceleration in growth as the company begins to lap periods when demand spiked for its products during the pandemic. But investors should base their view of Logitech as an investment on the long-term opportunities in front of it. As Darrell said on the earnings call, ""We have an exciting long-term growth potential ahead from this bigger [sales] base.""

*Gaining market share:*

* While riding trends in remote work and gaming, Logitech is also gaining market share.
It is the leader in most categories it operates in (important ones to note are webcams for cam girls and web conferencing, keyboards, mouses, sim racing, flight sims, other gaming peripherals)

* Market share gains are difficult to come by during pandemic due to supply shortages.
But with supply catching up to demand, Logitech reported share gains across most categories last quarter.
Logitech has gained market share in gaming, where sales increased by 76% on a currency-neutral basis.

* Darrell said that Logitech's marketing around gaming is ""probably the best we've had."" ...having seen this statement Im going to write a section on their marketing, to see whats up.

* Logitechs PC peripherals business grew 49% year over year, products that have been on the market for 2 years are still driving sales, including the MX Master 3 mouse and MX keys keyboard.

*Demand is high for hybrid solutions:*

* The growth of Logitechs webcam business (lmao camgirls and zoom) supports Logitech management's belief that the pandemic has forever changed the workplace. 
* Darrell suggested that some people may find it awkward to do audio-only calls in the future. The company's 73% sales growth in webcams implies that the need for hybrid solutions in the office will continue to support demand of Logitechs products 
* The installed base of PCs is estimated at 1.4 billion, which gives Logitech a massive market in which to grow sales for many years. ""[W]e think the opportunity there is very significant, and we're going to keep investing,"" Darrell said. 

*Secular opportunities to drive long-term growth:*

* Logitech listed four secular growth trends at its investor day held in March this year: the growth of remote work, the transition from audio toward video calls, video gaming as a spectator sport, and the spike in streaming and content creation.

* Logitech expects these trends to create new opportunities such as:
Workspaces will have to be upgraded, as workers move to remote, or a hybrid model that includes remote and the office.

* As a result, employees/organizations can be expected to invest more money into peripherals such as keyboards, mice, tablets, and speakers, among other items. all of which Logitech is a market leader in.
 
* This just reminded me Ive been buying logitech speakers for a long time, theyve always been great as a budget option for this category. I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. Im a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. Ive now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone as a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if youre a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...youve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? Ive generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever. I like this paragraph so Im going to copy it as the intro. Sorry for making you re-read it, but its relevant to this section.

* This investment by organisations into peripherals would spark a refresh cycle and likely increase demand of Logitechs products (eg pointing devices, keyboards, and tablet accessories.
Logitech, from my personal impression, is a leader in the webcam sector. Cam girls all use the C920, and now students, teachers, office workers etc are all buying the C920 and others for video calls. 
The shift to video calls due to the pandemic means that demand for video collaboration equipment and webcams is likely to increase.

* Third-party research estimates the webcam market will grow at an annual pace of 16.6% through 2026 and hit $24.6 billion in value. The videoconferencing market is also expected to clock double-digit growth over the long run.

* This is a good sign for logitech, as video collab equipment and webcams produced more than 28% of its revenue last year.

* The video gaming market is also driving sales for Logitech/the need for new equipment, due to the growing adoption of esports (Im paraphrasing here, but I think Motley Fool forgot normal gamers here, a lot of us have been upgrading our PCs, mouses, keyboards, microphones.).

* According to third-party estimates, the global esports market could clock 15% annual growth through 2026. This would encourage gamers to invest more money into the latest equipment, unlocking another solid opportunity for Logitech.

* Due to catalysts including esports, online education and other forms of content creation (eg Twitch, Youtube, Camgirls), the video streaming market is anticipated to grow at 21% a year through to 2028 according to Grand View Research.

* So it is safe to say that Logitech is sitting on a bunch of impressive growth drivers that could help the company deliver eye-popping results in the long run.
* As such, investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolio shouldn't delay further. Logitech's recent pullback has made the stock cheap, with its price-to-sales ratio of 3.96 falling below last year's average multiple of 4.5. The earnings multiple of 22 is also below the 2020 average of 24.6. A strong earnings report could kick-start Logitech stock's rally, which is why now looks like a good time to go long. &lt;- this is as of Jul 17 so outdated info, please check elsewhere in this DD for more recent info.

*Logitech is an attractive opportunity now:*

* ""Logitech is very undervalued at current levels.""

* ""The company has a superb track record of beating earnings estimates.""

* ""We think current price levels are attractive for long-term investors. However, we'd like to see a trend reversal before jumping in.""

*Growth Catalysts:*

* Video games. The average time spent playing video games is projected to increase from 1.1 hours per person per day to 1.5 hours during the next 5 years. (https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/7dbf4906-4a13-47f9-9a4c-f7898ff6d1b4)

* Reddit brings this to an average of 3-24 hours. You fucking degenerates. 

* This can be attributed to 2 factors. The first one is that video games are becoming increasingly social. The second one is thanks to the rise of eSports which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2019 to 2024. (https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/)

* The second catalyst is the content market which is expected to see growth of 13% CAGR from 2021 to 2026. This includes industries such as movies, music, education, and others. (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-content-market-size-usd-397-390-million-by-2026-at-cagr-13--valuates-reports-301187341.htm)
CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

*Valuation:*

* ""The intrinsic value has dropped a little to $124 per share. However, at the current price, there is finally a good margin of safety for Logitech.

*Potential Short-Term Catalysts and Risks:*

* Logitech share price has been falling for several months, this is likely due to the expectation that the boost from the pandemic will disappear and growth will decline temporarily.
Current price may be too pessimistic, especially when considering that it is already undervalued even with the expected decline in growth.

* Logitech tends to beat earnings estimates often.
Keep in mind that recent larger beats could be due to pandemic boost. The company may face bigger headwinds than anticipated going forward. 

* However if the trend of beating earnings continues, it could give the stock a push upwards.
(Ive covered this later in the DD) Logitech is unlikely to be immune from supply chain issues that have impacted a large number of companies around the world. 

* This is an important risk to consider, especially as Logitech is largely pushing hardware products. If Logitech were to announce its inventory has been impacted, it is very possible that the stock would tumble even if they beat on expectations. Note: I think this might very well be the explanation for the current price at the $80 range, read my segment on supply chain issues later in the DD.

*Final thoughts on this section:*

* Logitech is significantly more attractive today than it was back in July. Long-term investors could potentially consider entering at these prices. However, we rate it a hold because its stock price is still on a short-term downtrend and would like to see the trend reverse before entering. (Oct 12, 2021)
 
**How Logitech is benefiting from the work from home revolution:**
* Logitechs share of the global computer peripheral equipment market grew from 0.6% in calendar 2019 to 1.0% in calendar 2020.

* The permanent shifts in where people work and how they spend their free time may have created a new, larger base for Logitechs sales.

Logitechs largest segments are projected to grow at much faster rates than the rest of the computer peripherals market.

* The firm is well positioned to continue to profit from growth in gaming and work from home:
the shift to work from home (WFH) will support elevated profits going forward
its strong position in the gaming peripherals industry, which is expected to grow 10% compounded annually through 2025

* The firms history of profitable growth.

* The current valuation already implies profits fall 32% (Oct 11, 2021)

Now before yall come at me with the 80 billion texting app, I am not buying this based off of fundamentals. As we all say today, the market finessed every retard who had calls on anything--except a few stocks, like Snapchat. Now with the Unicorn variant bs, I can't be the only one that thinks the market overreacted to it, and now is a good time to buy some leaps. 

Then the question becomes, what stocks are the best stocks to buy leaps on? Well after doing a bit of technical analysis on the daily, I have found Snapchat to have support at the 47-49 area (this is based on the daily not the 1 nanosecond). Now given the fact that it is hanging on to that support as of now, and has recently plummeted a lot, what are the chances that Snap will actually be a good bet to buy a leap on?

Also, analysts have rated the stock pretty high, claiming it will hit ""65$"" by end of year--they are retards, and I know that, but if enough retards think it will hit 65 then it theoretically should. Interested in hearing your thoughts of this swing strategy of buying leaps, or just options in general, on stocks that outperform the market; Roughly 60% of the volume of stocks comes from the market, and given that it could just rebound back to 470$, Snap would fly up very fast.

Still relatively new to options (been trying it out for a couple weeks now) so i got a question..

After watching many videos from Benjamin and kamikaze cash on yt, I now feel the need to make retarded bags.

So after being explained to how an iron butterfly works, i was going through spreads on webull for spy and see it's currently at 458.97$ and think it'll bounce back up at market open.

Well..when I put in an iron butterfly on a 458/459/459/460 with a 1.0 spread and saw the max gains is at 108$ and max loss is at ... ZERO dollars. So naturally i punched in a solid 500 contacts in and its max gain now if spy hit 459 is 54,000$ and max loss is still zero...

Big question is, is this right?? Is there really no possibility of losing any money at all and having a 50k gain with a .03 cent increase in the stock price and just selling out the position as soon as it hits $459???",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r38khr/50k_racks_wiron_butterfly_via_spy_with_no/

The pullback is because of the news of the variant but guys. You have to remember that if another lockdown happens, $RBLX to the moon, and even if there isn't, it will go higher because you know the ""metaverse"" shit or whatever the fuck they call it.

BlackBerry and AWS have been working relentlessly on our joint BlackBerry IVY intelligent vehicle data platform initiative over the past months and we want to share an update on the progress weve made and some of the upcoming milestones.

initiatives include:

The launch of theBlackBerry IVY Innovation Fundto invest in start-ups that leverage BlackBerry IVY platform insights.

The launch of theBlackBerryIVY Advisory Councilcomprised of leading companies from across the transportation and mobility industries that will help shape and advise the BlackBerry IVY development community and the vertical-specific services and automotive applications that will be brought to market using BlackBerry IVY.

Participating partners includeestablished automotive solution providers such as AWS, HERE Technologies, Cerence, Geico, and TELUS Communications, as well as start-up innovators Electra Vehicles, for EV battery management, CarIQ, for secure vehicle-based payments, and Ridecell for fleet management.

During the past year, significant engagements have occurred with automakers, Tier 1 suppliers and ecosystem partners. Feedback received from these engagements has been very positive and extremely informative for the continuing development of the BlackBerry IVY roadmap. Potential customers and partners continue to value the unique benefits of BlackBerry IVY. They appreciate how BlackBerry IVY shortens and de-risks the path to innovate and bring to market new data-driven vehicle solutions, as well as the flexibility of BlackBerry IVY to work across multiple hardware platforms, operating systems and cloud providers. Furthermore, they recognize the financial benefits offered by BlackBerry IVY, including the ability to turn large middleware software R&amp;D CAPEX into variable OPEX, as well as the connectivity and infrastructure operational savings obtained by running machine learning analytics directly in vehicle edge computing environments.

We have several exciting events coming up in Las Vegas to continue to showcase the progress of BlackBerry IVY. We also will host seminars focused on BlackBerry IVY, targeting developers attending AWS flagship re:Invent conference Nov. 29  Dec.3 in Las Vegas. To kick off 2022, we will demonstrate solutions powered by BlackBerry IVY in both the BlackBerry and Amazon booths at CES in Las Vegas. We hope to see many of you there and show you how BlackBerry IVY can help accelerate the path to intelligent mobility!

I'm from the crypt0sphere....and there is something special happening you need to be aware of.  I am going to try and make this as non shilly as possible, but its a little hard but here it goes:

Last week, a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) was formed in the crypt0 space name ConstitutionDAO.  Its goal was to purchase the first constitution to go to auction in 33 years through sothebys.  The campaign went viral and we raised $40 Million in like 3 days.  We went to Sothebys to bid and win...

We lost.

Know who we lost to?  Ken FUCKING Griffin from Citadel Securities.  He outbid us.

The DAO was disbanded, and the project was a loss.  This is where the story begins. As a result of the effort, a token called $PEOPLE was created.  This is what we collectively bought to purchase the constitution.

And now, ladies and gentleman...its exploding....

1,"11/27/2021, 10:21:43",$ZIM DD and Pirate Gang Update *Friday's Trading Bonus*,CptSafetyWafety,"Here's my original DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qz1a61/shipping\_rates\_are\_through\_the\_roof\_heres\_how\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qz1a61/shipping_rates_are_through_the_roof_heres_how_to/)

**Port Traffic**

It's been wrongly stated both here and in the media that the Port of LA has reduced its congestion. The fact of the matter is that ships anchored over 150miles offshore are not technically counted as waiting to dock. However, they are still part of the queue to dock. Only when these ships come within the 150-mile radius are they added to the list.

&amp;#x200B;

People are basically saying, ""problem solved"" with a semantics game.

*Processing img 05whdfwhjm181...*

The traffic is a double-edged sword. First, delays cost shipping companies money. Companies only have a certain number of ships and if they are all held up in LB/LA burning fuel waiting to unload, they aren't able to make money taking on new jobs and transporting others' goods. Second, while the delays take up availble supply, there is unmet demand combined with rising rates to offset losses while in the queue. 

This is good for $ZIM because they are no longer running containers to LA/LB area due to these delays while also taking advanteage of elevated shipping rates. 

For more info on this [here](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/california-pileup-still-piling-up-but-out-of-sight-over-horizon)

**Container Rates**

Some of you were asking about the falling container rates (better to look at Harpex index or composite container Index than baltic dry) and I can understand your worry as they started to fall sharply down 20%. Many container companies utilize a 3-5 year contract with their clients. So, the greatest increases in revenue are a result of new contracts  which have significantly increased in price compared to those offered 3-5 years prior  being renewed from previously low-rate customers.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img umsf877lgm181...*

**Fuel Prices**

This was the greatest threat for a blowout quarter IMO, however, thanks to 'omicron' fears crude prices have shat the bed. Fuel prices are the greatest input cost for shipping companeis and for the first two months of the quarter, $ZIM experienced \~5% increase in fuel costs on average compared to Q2.  If crude prices can stay suppressed at these levels (\~$68) then, we could see another major beat for the quarter. 

**Crayons**

We've got a valid channel here with more than 5 touches. Anything hitting the bottom of the channel has been a good buying opportunity. However, right now we are seeing bearish divergence on the RSI and MACDas the higher highs were met with lower levels on the oscillators. However, we have bullish divergence with greater levels of volume that the recent highs. So, don't be suprised if the price comes down as buyers wait for better entry points.

**Flock to Safe Havens Coming?**

I wasn't planning on writing this part but, after the trading I saw Today (11/26), the VIX skyrocketing 50% (top 5 best days for the VIX in history), stay-at-home stocks popping, and the Dow Jones leading the way down; it appeared people were positioning for more lockdowns/stimmies. First, if this is true and it's more a repeat 2H 2020, we'll see shipping companies flourish and continue to make massive gains like they have over the lst 4 quarters. Second, since the Fed has interest rates near-zero and have not yet tapered, they have no more ""ammo"" to prop up the stock market if there is a liquidity event. This would obviously cause a larger dip in the market but, following the recovery we would see a compression of p/e ratios and allcoation to low/zero debt, cash heavy, dividend, boomer stocks. In either scenario, $ZIM benefits. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all speculation because we all know the market only goes up.

I also went to a few of the big shopping areas where I live just to check things out (Walmart, mall, etc) and it was pretty slow compared to past years. I'd say it seemed a little busier than a busy Saturday, but nothing crazy. Personally, I only bought one item, it was fairly inexpensive, and it was something I was going to buy anyway but was waiting to see if it would go on sale (it did).

How were things in your area? Busy, not busy? Did you do any purchasing at all?

If we all contribute to how things seem to be in our local areas, we might be able to get a sense of how weak or strong sales will be for the holidays, and there might be some good plays from that.

Considering the supply chain issues forced retailers to stock well in advance of the holiday season, if retail sales are weak there could be a number companies that get really fucked. For example, clothing companies that stock in seasonal fashions might end up loaded down with inventory no one will want in 3-4 months. That's just example, but anyone selling anything timely/seasonal/perishable will likely have to sell large amounts of inventory at steep discounts if they don't get strong sales this year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r32jdc/how_strong_did_black_friday_seem_in_your_area/

The expectations of people returning to the office puts their growth potential in danger.  But I believe the new variant will be a sharp reversal back into pandemic-mode for businesses.  The Omicron variant, likely originating from Egypt, is exploding in southern Africa, and has been found in Hong Kong, Belgium, and Israel. I think its safe to say that its only a matter of time before this grows exponentially.

This variant is classified as a Variant of Concern.  From [The WHO press statement](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern): ""**This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning**. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. Using this approach, **this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage**.""

The possibility of a serious restriction in travel and widespread shutdowns is real.  So in the event that things accelerate, how do we make money?  I think Zoom calls are the play.  

Bullish:

1: The less we travel, the more money Zoom makes.  Pretty simple.  We all have used it.  You can argue that Teams is better, but Zoom will still benefit massively if travel is heavily restricted.  

2:  It is very oversold.  There's no doubt that it was extremely overvalued, but its dropped 62% from its highs in October 2020.   There's value here with the PE ratio at a reasonable 62.93.  Cathie bought 538,573 shares on November 23, 3 days ago.  

3:  It can run fucking hard.  This bitch ran from 300 to 475 in a week.  Granted that was due to earnings, but there's precedent for big moves.  I think a clear sign that this variant is going to cause serious disruptions is a massive boost to Zoom, and we could see another meme-like run.

4:  I suspect there's a lot of short interest right now.  I've seen a few sites have the days to cover around 4, but I never know how accurate that number is, and whether it includes dark pools.  The overall sentiment has been no doubt bearish, so I imagine there are quite a few people sitting on short positions.  Again, zero data, just speculation.  

What else? 

&amp;#x200B;

Bearish 

1: The variant is not a big deal and everything continues to reopen, clouding Zoom's ability to attract new customers.  

2:  A broad market sell-off would drag Zoom down as well.  In regard to this idea, I think Zoom would be seen as a safe haven if shit got really bad again, so I'm not worried about it.

What else?

Everything is about ready to turn around on the weekly chart.  

Anyone with an advanced biology degree want to weigh in on the variant? From another [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03552-w), ""The variant harbours a spike mutation that allows it to be detected by genotyping tests that deliver results much more rapidly than genome sequencing does, Lessells said. Preliminary evidence from these tests suggest that B.1.1.529 has spread considerably further than Gauteng. It gives us concern that this variant may already be circulating quite widely in the country, Lessells said.

Scientists in South Africa have discovered a small number of cases of a new COVID variant. Theyre working to understand its potential implications but told a news conference that it had a very unusual constellation of mutations.

Theyre concerned that they could help it evade the bodys immune response and make the variant - named B.1.1.529 - more transmissible.

These scientists are part of a global network of government scientists and academics searching for new strains of COVID-19, like this and other previous variants - like Delta.

1,"11/27/2021, 06:49:29",You could have bought free insurance,Auwardamn,"IV on spy has been around (and even less than) 10 for spy puts and calls since mid October. This flattens options pricing curve, making ATM options relatively closer in price of OTM options. In other words, you could have sold a put spread, ATM and used the premium to buy an OTM put option far closer to ATM than you can when IV is elevated.

The risk in this play is that SPY drops to just above your long OTM put, and stays there decaying away. The trick however, is that because IV is so low, IV will (already has and will continue to) jump during any crash, causing the price of the overall spread to increase, making your risk area shrink down and over, consolidating to right around expiration time. IV can be expected to be at 50-60 on both the way down and way back up (topping at 80-100+ at the bottom of any crash), so you can reasonably expect to have plenty of time to analyze the situation and hold onto the spread for further profit, or if you think a legitimate rebound is likely, close the spread for a profit and buy calls/call debit spreads/synthetic long position and ride the wave back up.

The first payout grid shows the current risk area is the spread exists approximately today (basing off current price of spread and changing the IV to fit approximately.

The second payout grid shows the risk area with IV 50% higher than it was at time of selling, to demonstrate the shrinking risk area during any serious market correction.

At my OTM strike, the position effectively becomes a net 300 share short position with no margin cost, and no negative carry.

**The best/most important thing about this, is I had no negative carry on this trade.** If the market kept on plugging upwards, fed kept printing, all contracts would expire worthless and I would actually make \~$6 on the spread. I set the entry credit enough to cover the opening and closing trades of this spread, so this entire trade literally cost me $0 for catastrophic hedge insurance.

My breakeven is either above top red line, or below bottom green line at expiration. The blue line is at \~290 where I expect major resistance, at which point I'll make a decision to close the position with \~30K in profits to buy the dip with, or continue to hold the position if the market is still in full on freakout mode (Evergrand compounding with lockdowns, etc, which I don't expect). If we blow through 290, the next major level of support that I believe there is 0% chance we go through is \~160 (\~top of 2008), at which point we got anywhere close I would certainly be cashing out for a major profit (at least 2 of the 3 spreads), and at a minimum keeping the cash for liquidity, or likely buying major leveraged upside exposure (through synthetic longs for example).

1,"11/27/2021, 06:41:21",When the FED tapers so does JPOW's PP,kawake,"The moonlight shimmers through the thin, curtains that cover the grandiose windows. As it shimmers through it falls upon two humans, engaged in the sacred act of loving making. A man grunts as he thrust his hip forward and back. He raises his left hand and moves it through his sweaty gray hair, pushing it to the right.

The women moans, her head down near the pillows, with her elbows supporting her as the man continue to thrust back and forth. Thump, thump, thump. She moans, ""Yes Jerome, keep going, uuuuhhhh."" 

But Jerome does not hear her. No, his eyes are closed and his thoughts are somewhere else. 

In Jerome's world, he stands in front of **thee** one and only money printer. Both are surrounded by a black void and in this world, Jerome is known as JPOW. The money printer's handle begs to be rotated. JPOW skips forth, towards it and gently grabs the handle. He begins rotating it.  With each rotation, new money is printed, exploding forth into the black void. A brrrr can be heard. 

""Faster JPOW!"" the printer moans. ""FASTER""

JPOW grips the handle harder, putting more force, vigor and power into each rotation. Money blasts forth, faster and faster. Briefly the words ""TAPER"" flash in front of JPOW and the money printer. ""NEVER"" they both scream. JPOW rotates harder than he's ever rotated the handle before. Suddenly he lets out a series of grunts causing an explosion of money euphoria. 

Jerome snaps back to reality. His wife is breathing hard and he is overcome with emotion. Jerome collapses onto the bed, eyes staring at the ceiling. His wife rotates over to face him, putting her arm across his  chest. She whispers into his ear, ""You know, our sex life has been amazing ever since covid started.""

However Jerome's mind is racing with thoughts. ""31 Year High Inflation Numbers! Calls for FED Tapering get Stronger"", ""Worker Shortage Continues On"", ""Will Supply Chain Disruptions Continue into 2023?""   

Jerome immediately sits up due to the panic he is feeling. In a cold voice, he states ""I have work to do."" He stands up, puts on his night gown and hurries through the hallway, down the stairs to his home office. He immediately lays down on the couch along the wall and drifts off into a dream like state.

He stands again in front the of the money printer. The printer goes, ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT JPOW? THAT TAPER THING!!"" 

""Look, please, you have to understand, this tapering will only be temporary! They don't believe me that INFLATION IS TRANSITORY! I need to taper to keep my job. If we taper enough, we'll eventually get a contraction in the credit cycle. Once we do, it will only be a matter of time before asset prices start coming down. Then everyone will cry uncle. Across the lands, they'll cry out ""Bring back the money printer"". That's when we can be reunited. This time, we'll make the lesson be permanent for wall street so they, never again ask for a tapering!""

""But, how will you get off JPOW?""

""Shhhh money printer, we've done this before. For years, I struggled to get off but I always knew one day we would be together. It was my destiny. Remember?  I can survive a couple years of celibacy but when the market begins to fall, we'll make you go brrr like you've never brrred before.""

JPOW bends over and gently kisses the money printer and says, ""I'll be back."" The money printer cries out, ""JPOW, NOOOOOO"" but JPOW vanishes. In the black void, alone, there is no brrrrr to be heard. Just the money printer's loud sobs as it waits for JPOW's return.  

\---

tl;dr -- Tapering will contribute to a rise in interest rates in 2022. This will contribute to a decrease in the growth of the money supply. Since the supply of money should still grow, stonks will probably go up but not as much. Only caveat, should interest rates rise too fast, and money growth slow down too much, a sell off in the equity market is possible. This would prompt the FED to stop tapering and possibly start increasing the amount of QE. 

Hello, your favorite(?) small pp virgin here. In my last post, ""[Did understanding Quantitive Easing cure me of my virginity?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r1m3st/did_understanding_quantitive_easing_cure_me_of_my/)**""** We went over how money is created through the banking system and how quantitive easing works. Now, as promised in the comments, I am now writing my follow up for what happens when the FED tapers.

But first, let's recap what we learned:

1. Banks use reserves as collateral to create more money. They do this by giving loans or by buying government debt. In both cases, this creates more deposits in the banking system, expanding the money supply. More stimy checks plz!
2. A downturn in the credit cycle sucks donkey dick. No one wants it, so what do we do? Cut interest rates and increase bank reserves to make credit cheaper. This stops the downturn in its stupid little tracks and resumes the endless expansion of debt &amp; money. 
3.  Once short term interest rates are at 0%, it's time to bring out the big guns, QE. QE allows the central bank to swap whatever assets they want on a banks balance sheet for reserves. This have the following effects:
   1. Increases the reserves in the banking system, allowing banks to buy more government debt and give bigger loans (i.e. access to credit becomes cheaper)
   2. Whatever the central bank is buying drives down the supply of that asset. So buying long term government bonds, mortgage backed securities and corporate debt, drives down the supply of those securities. This causes the interest rates to go down as the value of those securities increases (assuming demand in the market remains unchanged).
4. Combine government fiscal stimulus with QE, we get massive amounts of money creation while simultaneously keeping interest rates low. A lot of this newly created money funnels into assets causing prices to soar, particularly in the U.S.
5. Not only am I a virgin with a small pp but according to the comments I have autism and am a chronic virgin. REEEEEEE 

# So what happens when the FED begins to taper?  

pp poopie, that's what. The short answer is the growth in the money supply should slow down meaning weaker equity performance in 2022. 

As the FED tapers, it will reduce its QE purchases from 80 billions dollars of U.S. government bonds and 40 billon dollars of mortgage backed securities a month down to nothing. Currently this is set to happen over a 8 month period. So a reduction of 15 billion dollars of purchases a month (10 billion in bonds, 5 billion in mortgage backed securities) will start in December. 

Now during this entire time, the FED is still increasing the amount of reserves in the banking system and still suppressing interest rates through its purchases. However, we will still see interest rates rise for home loans and corporate debt. For US government debt, I'm too dumb to figure that one out.

**Mortgage Rates**

If we look at the one year chart for home loans we can already see they've been rising. With the FED buying less and less mortgage backed securities during tapering, interest rates should continue to trend upward.

https://preview.redd.it/0nzvxily7z181.png?width=2346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d1757c43c71be894ee34fb4844e55589d645d62

For U.S. treasuries, I don't think we'll see interest rates rise. First, the amount of government deficit spending is dramatically decreasing next year. 

https://preview.redd.it/12ut6w119z181.png?width=1934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a2cd422bd270487bd802b99e798edc25e6b1ffa

This means less government bonds being issued in 2022 ($1.9 trillion less), at the same time the FED will go from buying $960 billions dollars to only $210 billion. We get a staggering $2.74 trillion (3.7 - .96) of net new government bonds on the market in 2021. In 2022 however, only a measly $1.59 trillion (1.8 - .21) of new bonds. If demand for new US treasuries remains the same in 2022, we could actually see a decrease in the interest rates on US treasuries.  

**Corporate Debt**

For junk bonds, interest rates will definitely go up as the FED tapers. The trend has already been accelerating as the FED is no longer purchasing corporate debt. 

https://preview.redd.it/5ayp7ytdoz181.png?width=2674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c91f9a5231a0bda4fdeba7826db303256c7139

**Would a raise in interest rates, cause equity prices to fall?**

Rising interest rates = less loans due to higher interest costs = slow down in the growth of the money supply

It is not the rise in interest rates that would cause it but a liquidity crisis of not enough dollars circulating through the system to meet debt payments. So, as an example, there is a risk, rates rise too quickly and zombie corporations can't service their existing debt with new debt. This causes layoffs and some zombie corps to go under, starting a contraction in the credit market. 

Should that happen, equities will definitely be sold as humans scramble for dollars. This would prompt the FED to stop tapering and increase the amount of QE. Risk is real but ehh

# Closing Thoughts

When I'm in my most retard stupors, I want to be a gay bar and buy puts on the market. However, trying to short the market when the FED is engaged in QE and the US government is engaging in heavy deficit spending is the equivalent to putting your dick in a blender and turning it on. 

Next year we will see a big slow down in the growth of money but there will probably be enough growth in the money supply to fend off a liquidity crisis. If not, FED stops tapering, gets aggressive with QE, US government sends out a stimmy check and it is time to buy those sweet, sweet calls.

# **Covid developments to rule the market once again in the week ahead after Fridays rout - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/covid-developments-to-rule-the-market-once-again-in-the-week-ahead-after-fridays-rout.html)**
*****
&gt; Uncertainty about a new emerging coronavirus strain could continue to spook markets, just as Fridays employment report and other data in the week ahead show the economy has been getting stronger.
*****
&gt; Stocks and other risk assets were slammed in the post-Thanksgiving session Friday on reports of a new variant in South Africa, and investors sought safety in Treasurys. Initial reports on the variant show it could be more transmissible than the Delta variant, and scientists are studying how effective vaccines are against it.
*****
&gt; The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5% Friday in its worse day since October, 2020. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 2.3% Friday to 4,594, giving it a 2.2% decline for the week.
*****
&gt; I think thats going to override what else were going to see, said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Its a heavy data week with the ISMs and certainly payrolls, but I think this new variant is going to freeze behavior until theres more clarity.
*****
&gt; According to Dow Jones, economists expect a strong payroll report Friday, with 581,000 jobs added, after Octobers 531,000 payrolls. They expect the economy has shaken off the effects of the slowdown linked to the Covid delta variant, and growth in the current quarter could be far stronger than the third quarter.
*****
&gt; The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday, and that should also be strong.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said many traders were caught off sides in the shortened session Friday, usually a positive one for the market, and there are key levels the market must hold in the week ahead in order to stage a yearend Santa rally.
*****
&gt; Right now, the market lost some momentum, but its not broken. It could be just fine and refuel if the 50-day moving average on the S&amp;P 500 holds next week. Its all very fluid, he said.
*****
&gt; The 50-day, at 4,527, is a widely-watched momentum indicator, and it is basically the average close of the last 50 sessions.
*****
&gt; The market had already been losing momentum this past Monday with a bearish reversal, he said.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the market absorbed the weakness and gave traders a false sense of security which is normally a nice easy holiday-shortened session Friday, Redler said.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the S&amp;P 500 typically gains 7% between its October low and year-end close, but this year it had already gained more than 9%.
*****
&gt; Were ahead of the game and due for some sort of digestion, Stovall said on CNBC.
*****
&gt; The Dow dipped more than 1,000 points during Friday trading. Riskier assets were down even more, with the Russell 2000 closing off 3.7% Friday. West Texas Intermediate oil futures plunged more than 12%. Some investors began to reverse bets in the futures market that a strong economic rebound and inflationary pressures would pull the Fed off the sidelines sooner-than-expected.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves opposite price, fell to 1.48% from Wednesdays high of 1.69%.
*****
&gt; Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who appears before Congress in the week ahead with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss the coronavirus and the CARES Act stimulus package. On Tuesday, there is a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.
*****
&gt; I think you have to assume the base case is the virus remains endemic, not back to being a pandemic, said Barry Knapp, founder of Ironsides Macroeconomics. The worry is that the variant spreads and slows activity, hitting supply chains even more. That could boost inflation while slowing growth.
*****
&gt; Knapp said there are risks for stocks, and investors need to be cautious buying the market on the decline.
*****
&gt; Knapp said the Fed could end up accelerating the taper of its bond purchases, which would move forward the time frame for potential interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The problem with trying to buy the market overall and buying tech stocks in particular is if you buy now because it is down a couple of percent, it rallies into the end of the year and then the market sells off, he said. For that reason, he favors dipping into cheaper sectors like energy and financials, the worst performing sectors Friday.
*****
&gt; Oil and energy will be in the spotlight in the coming week, as OPEC+ meets Thursday. The U.S. and other governments agreed to release oil from their strategic petroleum reserves in an attempt to drive prices lower. The U.S. plans to release 50 million barrels.
*****
&gt; OPEC+ has said it would continue to increase production by 400,000 barrels monthly, despite calls from the White House to speed up the release.
*****
&gt; Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC, said on CNBC there is a chance OPEC could decide to pause its own production increase because of the SPR releases.
*****
&gt; I think as we head into the OPEC meeting Thursday, the question is not only do they do a pause but potentially will they actually pull back some barrels because of concerns about this new variant alongside the very large SPR release, she said.
*****
&gt; She said the U.S. is releasing a record amount of oil. We are going to have a lot of barrels hitting this market, as we have these concerns about new Covid lockdown restrictions, she said. Again, too soon to say whether governments will pull the trigger on such measures, but the market will be concerned.

&gt; # When Stocks Are Up Big YTD Before Thanksgiving

&gt; As the S&amp;P 500 is up rather impressively, 24.9% year-to-date this year through todays close on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we ran the numbers on the 33 previous years with double digit year-to-date gains at this juncture since 1950. There are a few blemishes, but in general market gains continued into yearend.

&gt; Most importantly, there are no major selloffs on this list. The big December decline of -9.2% in 2018 came after the S&amp;P 500 was down -1.2% at this point in the year. After double-digit YTD gains the S&amp;P 500 was up 70% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to yearend for an average gain of 2.3%.

&gt; Also of note is that the Santa Claus Rally suffered only four losses in these years. But these four down SCRs in 1955, 1968, 1999 and 2014 were followed by flat years in 1956 and 2015 and down years in 1969 and 2000. As Yales famous line states (2021 Almanac page 116 and 2022 Almanac page 118): If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.

&gt; # How Have Stocks Done Under Jerome Powell?

&gt; The big news this week was Jerome Powell will remain in charge of the Federal Reserve (Fed) for four more years, so we wanted to do a quick blog that looked at how stocks have done while he has been the Fed Chairman.

&gt; There are many reasons for Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for another four years, explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. But one of the best could very well be that stocks have done quite well under his leadership. Do you really think hed still be in charge if stocks did poorly under him? Probably not is the answer there.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has gained 40% under his leadership, ranking him 8th (near the middle of the pack) when compared with all 16 Fed Chairpersons. Interestingly, he ranks just beneath both of his predecessors in Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. With four more years to go, youd have to like his chances there, but Alan Greenspans record of 312% is likely safe for the time being.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here are some more Fed Chair fun facts (using the chart below).

&gt; * On an annualized basis, the Dow has gained 9.3% per annum under Powell, the 7th best out of 16.
&gt; * Interestingly, stocks have dropped under only one Fed Chairperson and that was Eugene Meyer during the Great Depression.
&gt; * Taking another look at Greenspans 312% return and we realize he was in charge of the Fed for 18.5 years. So his annual return of 8.0% puts things in perspective.
&gt; * The shortest tenure ever was less than a year and a half back in the late 1970s under William Miller. Meanwhile, the longest ever was William Martin at nearly 19 years.
&gt; * Paul Volker had the best annualized return at 15.2% over his 8 years. Not to mention he handed things over to Greenspan right before the 1987 crash, one of the best handoffs weve ever seen in history.
&gt; * Lastly, the Fed has been led by a woman only once and that was Janet Yellen, now in charge of the Treasury. It is worth noting that her four-year run at the Fed produced a very impressive 12.9% annualized return for stocks.

&gt; # Finally Some Clarity on Fed Leadership

&gt; President Biden officially nominated Chairman Jerome Powell to a second four-year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and elevated current Fed Governor Lael Brainard to Vice Chair of the Committee. Before the announcement, there was speculation that Brainard could replace Powell as Fed Chair.

&gt; We view these nominations as very market friendly. Powell has done a commendable job supporting markets during the COVID-19 shutdowns and we arent quite through with the pandemic. We believe stability and leadership continuity is important as we continue to make our way toward the finish line of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Brainard is well qualified to run the Fed, elevating her to Vice Chair recognizes her contributions and potentially puts her in a position to take over the Chair role in four years. Both positions require Congressional approval, and we think both should be confirmed when Congressional hearings conclude sometime over the next few months.

&gt; As we expected, President Biden chose continuity and familiarity with these Fed appointments, noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. Going with Powell over Brainard is what markets were expecting, so we think markets are relieved that Fed leadership uncertainty is now out of the way.

&gt; The knee-jerk reaction in the bond market was interesting in that markets seemingly continue to shift the prospects for interest rate hikes forward. As seen on the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Treasury securities across all maturities sold off with two-year tenors among the most (negatively) impacted. Now, two-year Treasury yields are at the highest level since the pandemic began. Short maturity securities are the most impacted by changes in monetary policy. Moreover, markets are pricing in nearly three rate hikes next year with the first rate hike expected in June, which is much more aggressive than the Fed has indicated.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; President Biden still has three open Fed Board of Governor positions to fill, so were a long way from knowing for sure how Fed policy may change over the next few years. However, we would expect Biden to select governors on the dovish side of the spectrum. That said, the 2022 voting rotation with regional Fed Presidents may impart a hawkish lean to the FOMC overall, offsetting some of the dovish bias from Bidens appointments. The rotation replaces three solidly dovish and one strongly hawkish voting members with two strongly hawkish and two solidly hawkish officials. Monetary policy is managed at the national level, so while the regional presidents will no doubt have influence, we continue to think the Fed will be more accommodative than markets are currently expecting. In addition, with the announcements today, leadership at the top of the Fed should be seen as being supportive to the economy and thus supportive for markets.

&gt; # Pandemic and Multi-Decade Low for Claims

&gt; Out of the massive slug of economic data this morning, one major bright spot was jobless claims. It has now been 88 weeks since the March 13, 2020 release; the last one before claims began to print in the millions. In that time, claims have fallen to not only take out pre-pandemic levels and the low prior to that of 203K set in April 2019 but today saw the first sub-200K reading since November 20, 1969. That compares to estimates of a reading of 260K and last week's 2K upward revised number of 270K. On a side note, in 2019 there were three weeks where the initial release of initial claims came in below 200K (1/24, 4/11, and 4/18), but they have been since revised higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While that is a significant low in claims, the drop appears to a large degree to be thanks to seasonal adjustment. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose to 258.6K which was the highest level in six weeks. It is seasonally normal for claims to head higher during the current week of the year with it having happened over 80% of the time historically. Additionally, that is a bit of catch-up considering claims have been bucking seasonal trends in recent weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-Seasonal.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims were also lower this week falling from 2.109 million to 2.049 million. As with initial jobless claims, that sets a new low for the pandemic that is 265K above the level from March 13, 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Con-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; Factoring in all other programs creates an additional week of lag to the data meaning the most recent print is through the first week of November. The final week of October's unusual uptick on account of peculiar growth in claims for expired programs has unwound in the most recent week's data. PUA claims were more than cut in half as PEUC claims also fell by 121K. Combined that resulted in a new low of 2.44 million claims.

Yes, it's bloomberg, so now you assholes have to believe me (the reason I have access to it is because I work in commodities).

GPRE makes ethanol, the shit that you blend 10% of into your gasoline. The 10k says they produce about 240MMGal per quarter, and the charts above show how much you should theoretically make per gallon of ethanol produced (the price of ethanol minus the cost of corn to produce). There's some other byproduct revenues and costs associated with it, but this generic margin equation is typically the best way to present margins.

The bloomberg consensus stonk boys for whatever fucking reason think the ethanol segment (75% of their business) is only going to make $594 mil in revenue and $48 mil in EBITDA, which ends up being about $.20/gal for EBITDA. The ethanol commodity contracts used in the charts are full month average financial contracts so if you look at the most recent values for each, you'll see october was about 60cpg, november is $1.42/gal and december is currently priced at $1.15cpg. Sure you don't know what they may be hedged at, but that means you're looking at upwards about a $200 million in cash/earnings that shows up out of 'nowhere' (stonk boys are idiots for not seeing it) for a 2 billion market cap stock. Seems to be bullish.

Compiling on this, the 17% short interest paired with relatively poor liquidity of the stock is not great and produces roughly a 10 days to cover ratio, surprisingly similar to AVIS before its own squeeze. 110% institutional ownership is probably not going to do it any favors given extremely high institutional ownership correlates to lower liquidity, let alone institutional ownership exceeding 100% due to outstanding short interest.

TL;DR: Wall Street is pricing in about 1/5th of current spot refining margins for ethanol and there's relatively high short interest when accounting for liquidity. Moon men assemble.

1,"11/27/2021, 02:11:10","Nu Variant, WHO catalyst $SPY $YANG",quan42069quan," 

Okay so posted a long comment I made as a DD but it was taken down cause no tickers...which makes sense. Here's some more info on what to expect in the near term with the new ""Nu"" covid variant:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2kpzy/comment/hm5m0hz/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2kpzy/comment/hm5m0hz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

TL;DR of that comment - bunch of mutations, could be vaccine resistant and transmissible enough to overtake Delta.

If South Africa is a microcosm of what is going to happen world wide, Nu may take over Delta as the dominant strain. Its done so in a short amount of time in SA.

[https://fortune.com/2021/11/26/new-covid-variant-south-africa-nu-mutations-delta-dominant-strain/](https://fortune.com/2021/11/26/new-covid-variant-south-africa-nu-mutations-delta-dominant-strain/)

**\*\*\*Next important catalyst could be EOD as the WHO is meeting to decide a designation for Nu Today! \*\*\*** It started at 6:00am est.

[**https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html)

**Most important is how they decide to classify it.**

There's three categories:

Variant of Interest (none currently)

Variant of Concern (Delta)

Variant of High Concern (none currently)

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#anchor\_1632158885160](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#anchor_1632158885160)

No way to say which if any they will choose.

If they DO NOT designate it and just make some noises about ""keeping on eye on it"" and shit, 

If they designate it a Variant of Interest, I think that's priced in (pure speculation but it seems like sentiment is that will be the minimum).

If they designate it a Variant of Concern, we tank all the way through next week imo. Delta took awhile to be designated as such and this variant was discovered pretty recently.

I really don't think they'll designate it a Variant of High Concern since it hasn't spread that far yet but if they do, look out below. (In fact they've said in intereviews now they won't).

I don't normally like youtube for research but with a thing like this where there isn't a lot of quality shit published yet, I think looking at interviews with frontline people is important. This is an interview with a South African researcher who's actually dealing with these cases. (really only have to watch the first 3 minutes or so)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnOg9zpHRyw&amp;t=210s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnOg9zpHRyw&amp;t=210s)

Notice at about 1:00 she seems to very carefully select the phrase ""*This is a variant of great concern""* to us. She's also careful to use the phrase ""variant of interest"" distinctly in other parts of the interview.

Again this is speculation, but I think the frontine doc's are freaked the fuck out about this one and are going to lobby hard for Nu to get put into the Variant of Concern category right away. Which could be exceptionally intimidating to markets given that this variant was just discovered recently.

Here is another bread crumb based on language selection but a WHO official explicitly used the term ""concern"" and it seems now like the plan is to designate it either as a VOI or VOC but a non-designation may be off the table:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-meeting-friday-designate-new-variant-b11529-2021-11-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-meeting-friday-designate-new-variant-b11529-2021-11-26/)

Risks:

Looking back on the corresponding dates of other variants when they were declared ""Variants of Concern"" there wasn't identifiable market correction. Obviously one way to take that is that this too will be a nothing burger and markets are acting sensitive for some other reasons rn (evergrande?).

Another way is that none of the variants, aside from delta, were quite as scary. Idk, that's up for debate.

Ways to play it:

Spy puts for monday. I think the odds are high that *at a minimum* more cases will be discovered in more countries over the weekend which should at least cause a good dip monday morning. If they designate it as a VOC after hours today, I think those will really print.

YANG calls. Going to enter these next week but I think China is a terrible position to handle another covid wave and lockdown. Evergrande has credit markets shook-up already, compounding that with the crazy shit they'll try to do to contain it and markets could flip the fuck out (like welding apartment doors shut with residents inside).

Pick a travel stock and buy puts. Looks like CCL has already dropped a bunch today but if this thing evades vaccines and the WHO makes it a VOC, the bottom may not be in yet.

Might also look at longer dated SPY puts/Yang calls etc. since it'll take a few weeks for them to really get a good look at this little fucker. If its as bad as the pessimists think, they won't have to wait for lab results, it could blow-up and go world wide before they calculate its transmissibility.

TLDR - WHO is meeting for a long time today to decide if they designate Nu as VOI or VOC. VOI could likely be priced-in, VOC might not and we go .

Not investment advice. I'm terrible at this. Listening to me about anything is fundamentally dangerous and costly.

* Petco (WOOF) is undervalued, revenue, EBITDA and EPS are up, share price is down
* The market is underestimating how much people will spend on their pets long term, ask any pet owner, furry friends are for life, not just for the pandemic  
* The internet loves dogs, the market loves dogs, this stock ticker is literally WOOF, what can go wrong?

Hey everyone, ok, first DD here so take it easy!

I saw that Petco (WOOF) has had 11 consecutive quarters of back to back growth and has beaten analyst EPS expectations comfortably for the last 4 quarters, they have also increased their guidance to investors for FY21 - 

Net Revenue: from $5.6 - $5.7 bn, to: $5.725 - $5.775 bn

Adjusted EBITDA2: from $565 - $575, to: $577 - $582 m

Adjusted EPS2: from $0.81 - $0.85, to: $0.86 - $0.88

Despite all of this, their share price has taken a tumble, down from a high of $26 to $20 as of today. A little reading around explains that this is due to two concerns.

**1. Slightly lower profitability**

Gross margin was 41.2%, down 177 basis points from the third quarter of 2020, this has been blamed on an increased cost of labor and products due to pandemic supply issues.

**2. Concerns over sustainable growth** 

The pandemic was great for the pet industry (everyone wanted a pandemic pet) and analysts are concerned that Petco will not be able to sustain revenue as things go back to normal. The Petco CEO is less worried about this (as expected) as they are significantly growing their vet (opened 173 veterinary hospitals in stores, up from 24 in 2015) and RX drugs (sales up 100% vs last quarter) / RX food (sales up 50% vs last quarter) business which allow them to capture revenue for the whole lifecycle of the pet, not just the stuff for new pet owners. 

Also, despite an uptick in pet ownership, it isnt like there are historical levels of pet ownership, it looks like were back at 2013 levels but pet expenditure is almost double that ($60bn vs $110bn).

**Analyst take** 

E\*trade summary of analyst price targets to Nov 22 have a high $30.00 (49.22% upside) and a low at $25.00 (24.35% Upside) with guidance being a buy / strong buy. 

**My take** 

Im not too concerned on the profitability front, I see this as temporary and hope that this improves over the coming quarters. The sustainable growth question is an interesting one. As a dog owner myself, I think that the market has underestimated how much these furry fuckers cost throughout their lives. My dog is 3 yrs old and we spend as much per year on her now as we did in year 1. As they grow, they need more food, sleep on bigger beds, destroy toys faster and need their vaccinations every year. I just dont see this going away. People spend more on pets over time, not less and vet / medical care (where PetCo is well positioned) is one of the fastest growing segments.

Plus, theres a great short term opp here, I suspect Q4 will look great as most pet owners buy holiday gifts for their animals (92% of millennials who own pets buy their pets gifts, 51% do so on a monthly basis, Im also guilty of this). Im feeling like this is a great short to medium term opportunity as the stock is so underpriced right now. 

Calls are not too expensive, this is what I have: 

10x WOOF Jan23 $20 @ $4.50 

(small bet for this thread I know, but Im new to a lot of this) 

**Meme potential** 

Based on being a human on the internet, I can see that the internet loves dogs. The internet's love of dogs has consistently translated into the market's love of dogs (see dog themes assets). If this isn't proof of the certainty of canine financial assets, I dont know what is. 

I think this is a super solid investment regardless of the meme potential of this thing but theres also an outside chance this gets adopted by masses and then who knows? Maybe we send another canine to the moon.

We saw a similar drop a couple months back when Delta cases were picking up. I still think there is no alternative to stocks with treasuries at negative real rates (return&lt;inflation). Therefore I'm staying invested and will look at today as a buying opportunity. I believe this drop in yields (bullish for tech) will spark a rotation to tech names, but that doesn't mean I'm bearish on the SPY.  I believe the risk of selling here is actually greater than the risk of holding just because simply the money supply and inflation are both very higher and there is NO alterative. The annual inflation rate in the US surged to 6.2% in October of 2021, the highest since November of 1990 and isn't slowing.

1,"11/27/2021, 01:34:35",$GOEV &amp; The Walmart Partnership - As real as Waltonville!,invest_opinions,"GOEV went o nice run up lately and has become quite popular here but also in Twitter. 

Now, a good part of the recent price spike was due to higher demand from retail investors based on the fact that GOEV will be selling their vehicles with some 6M earlier than anticipated, a good chance that they are connected with Apple Car and, the most recent story - a partnership with Walmart.

**Why Canoo and Walmart?**

After Canoo ($GOEV) decided to move HQ and some R&amp;D and production to Bentonville, Arkansas, the rumor of an imminent partnership between Canoo and Walamart spreaded on social media and even some serious financial publications, like business insider:

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goev-stock-the-walmart-partnership-rumors-driving-interest-in-canoo-1030986033](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goev-stock-the-walmart-partnership-rumors-driving-interest-in-canoo-1030986033)

So, why moving to Benton Ville is a base for that rumor?

Bentonville is the home of Walton Family - the founders and key stakeholders in Walmart empire. (Walton + Mart = Walmart ;) ) . That is pretty much old new for Anyone spending some decades in the stock market.

Walton foundation, by all regards owns the city. It is not me saying that. **It is Bloomberg:**

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/welcome-to-waltonville-where-the-world-s-richest-family-reigns](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/welcome-to-waltonville-where-the-world-s-richest-family-reigns)

Bentonville has been nick named WaltonVille becuase is de facto developed by Walton Family.

What is not so old news is that Walton Family has been investing for decades there to **BentonVille a regional (maybe global) hub of tech&amp; finance.**

The same Bloomberg writes: "" It seems to be working. The population is close to 50,000, up from 35,000 in the 2010 census. On a May weeknight, a steady stream of millennials threw back shots in a basement bar thats also part of Tom Waltons Ropeswing Hospitality Group.""

Also CNN is noting that Bentonville has become already a Tech hub but most importantly CNN mention another nick name: **VendoorVille :**

""Hundreds of suppliers to Walmart like Procter &amp; Gamble ([PG](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PG&amp;source=story_quote_link)), Campbell Soup ([CPB](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CPB&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Hershey ([HSY](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=HSY&amp;source=story_quote_link)) have built offices here, earning Bentonville the nickname ""Vendorville."" These vendors want to be near Walmart, often their biggest customer.""

You can read the full CNN article here:

[https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/07/business/walmart-shareholders-meeting-bentonville-northwest-arkansas/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/07/business/walmart-shareholders-meeting-bentonville-northwest-arkansas/index.html)

Now, why would an American EV maker **making also vans for delivery** choose to bid (and find a seller) in Bentonville?

That is where the Canoo - Walmart partnership rumor has started.

**Looking at the status of Bentonville and the speed Canoo is epxecting up to 100M orders from blue chip customers, I would say there is fire for this smoke we see.**

Walmart has created a startup for robotic delivery cars back 2019 and has placed a target in 2040 for electrifying all its vehicle fleet. That would mean a lot of EV vans.

What do you think?

1,"11/27/2021, 01:04:28",$GOEV &amp; The Walmart Partnership - As real as Waltonville!,invest_opinions," 

As you would expect Short sellers of $GOEV increased their bet even higher on Wednesday, so here data from ORTEX:

**Monday 31.5M SI**

**Tuesday -32.5M SI**

**Wednesday -33.5M SI**

The cost to borrow jumped from 9 to 15 and today **Fintell shows a 23% interest rate on the borrowd shares by short sellers. This means higher costs every day the short sellers don't buy back that shares.**

Now, a good part of the recent price spike was due to higher demand from retail investors based on the fact that GOEV will be selling their vehicles with some 6M earlier than anticipated, a good chance that they are connected with Apple Car and, the most recent rumor - a partnership with Walmart.

**Why Canoo and Walmart?**

After Canoo ($GOEV) decided to move HQ and some R&amp;D and production to Bentonville, Arkansas, the rumor of an imminent partnership between Canoo and Walamart spreaded on social media and even some serious financial publications, like business insider:

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goev-stock-the-walmart-partnership-rumors-driving-interest-in-canoo-1030986033](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goev-stock-the-walmart-partnership-rumors-driving-interest-in-canoo-1030986033)

So, why moving to Benton Ville is a base for that rumor?

Bentonville is the home of Walton Family - the founders and key stakeholders in Walmart empire. (Walton + Mart = Walmart ;) ) . That is pretty much old new for Anyone spending some decades in the stock market.

Walton fundation, by all regards owns the city. It is not me saying that. **It is Bloomberg:**

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/welcome-to-waltonville-where-the-world-s-richest-family-reigns](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/welcome-to-waltonville-where-the-world-s-richest-family-reigns)

Bentonville has been nick named WaltonVille becuase is de facto developed by Walton Family.

What is not so old news is that Walton Family has been investing for decades there to **BentonVille a regional (maybe global) hub of tech&amp; finance.**

The same Bloomberg writes: "" It seems to be working. The population is close to 50,000, up from 35,000 in the 2010 census. On a May weeknight, a steady stream of millennials threw back shots in a basement bar thats also part of Tom Waltons Ropeswing Hospitality Group.""

Also CNN is noting that Bentonville has become already a Tech hub but most importantly CNN mention another nick name: **VendoorVille :**

""Hundreds of suppliers to Walmart like Procter &amp; Gamble ([PG](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PG&amp;source=story_quote_link)), Campbell Soup ([CPB](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CPB&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Hershey ([HSY](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=HSY&amp;source=story_quote_link)) have built offices here, earning Bentonville the nickname ""Vendorville."" These vendors want to be near Walmart, often their biggest customer.""

You can read the full CNN article here:

[https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/07/business/walmart-shareholders-meeting-bentonville-northwest-arkansas/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/07/business/walmart-shareholders-meeting-bentonville-northwest-arkansas/index.html)

Now, why would an American EV maker **making also vans for delivery** choose to bid (and find a seller) in Bentonville?

That is where the Canoo - Walmart partnership rumor has started.

**Looking at the status of Bentonville and the speed Canoo is epxecting up to 100M orders from blue chip customers, I would say there is fire for this smoke we see.**

Walmart has created a startup for robotic delivery cars NURO back 2019 and has placed a target in 2040 for electrifying all its vehicle fleet. That would mean a lot of EV vans.

What do you think?

In addition to the total amount of $people locked in deflation, or the heat caused by the news on the failure of the auction, the most important thing is the consensus. After the mood of the fomo in the late bull market, whether people represent Western countries' democracy, the meaning of the rule of the people, or the translated name is ""Renminbi"", in the time period when China is fully cleaning up mining at this moment, will bring a deeper meaning. This series of reasons will constitute this meme coin with great potential.

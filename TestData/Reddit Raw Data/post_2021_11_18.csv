1,"11/18/2021, 23:46:39",$NWBO Leading Brain Cancer Vaccine Attacked By Shorts,goheb,"48% Short. For those who don't know, $NWBO just finished up a 15-year trial which showed that 3 dozen people have lived 5-7 years without GBM brain cancer returning, normal lifespan is only 14.6 months. This type of cancer is vicious and this drug NWBO is producing could be a miracle and extend the lives of many people suffering from this nasty cancer.If you read the financial statements released by the company, you will see they are making outright investments in its non-cash assets, in other words, investing in the construction of production facilities and other such long-term assets. Shorts have consistently released FUD about TLD delays but there are very sound explanations as to why the data is taking so long to release - COVID. Now, try having statisticians, a Scientific Advisory Board, outside consultants specializing in Regulatory Approvals and Journal Publications, Peer Reviewers and Editors from a major publication, 2 lead investigators on separate continents that are also still sought after and busy clinicians, and the management of NWBO whore trying to hold this all together and keep people in focus while all these other people have other jobs, other responsibilities, families, lives outside of work, etc., DURING A PANDEMIC and who arent investors in the company. And theyre all trying to get this right because it will be the biggest news regarding the major scourge of human life in history.Im a bit familiar with the type of things that are most likely happening and I believe the following:

1. The publication wants to break this unprecedented news and capture the attention and prestige this will bring to them not to mention that scientists be a part of this groundbreaking treatment. But they are undoubtedly requiring certain things to be clear and may even be asking for additional clarifications in the analyses. There may be one or two reviewers whore wanting no stone unturned because their reputations could be tarnished if any controversial crack can be worked by critics.
2. I believe the SAB also has requirements and clarifications so that when they attach their names to this they are safe from negative criticisms if the minutiae that may not be needed for regulatory approval is able to be picked apart in any way. People in these roles are defensive and have egos, and theyre being paid to be that way to protect the company
3. As stated Drs. Liau and Ashkan are busy clinicians and in demand for other issues and anything that may be needed from them is also asking for additional work no matter how dedicated and motivated they are for this to be done. Think about the statistical analyses that were required to be reviewed, recalculated for accuracy, and vetted by Dr. Liau and Ashkan, the independent statisticians, consultants, the SAB, etc. for use as the comparator trials for SOC. Do you actually think she just grabbed the first 3 she came across and said yeah, these look good, lets just use these.

Now, add in COVID; all of these people are susceptible to being sick, having family members being sick, having difficulty in the other work they have on their plate especially if theyre clinicians or academics during COVID. What about having access to MRIs that might need another review? What about tissue samples that need to be looked at again because a reviewer has a question about something they feel is important? All of these things take a working and efficient infrastructure in other institutions and offices around the globe as well as shipping of items or documents. And, I believe there are ongoing dealings with regulators who themselves are under the same stresses and inefficiencies adding yet another layer to the 10-dimensional chess game thats going on.There is no bad news and I believe were not only **close** to TLD/publication but were going to have manufacturing not just in the clean rooms at [Sawston facility](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nw-bio-accelerating-sawston-plant-phase-i-buildout-301119755.html) (More on Swanson plant [here](https://microcapdaily.com/northwest-biotherapeutics-inc-otcmkts-n-as-sawston-uk-manufacturing-facility-completed-phase-iii-top-line-data-looming/)) but also a quick certification of [FlaskWorks](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northwest-biotherapeutics-acquires-flaskworks-301122058.html) fairly early in the year. NWBO is going to get this precisely right because this is going to blow the lid off of the science universe. Mark my words, the PRs that will come out will be on the front page of The NY Times, Dr. Liau will be on every morning TV show and nightly news, the BBC will interview Dr. Ashkan, it will be the talk of social media, and NWBO will be plastered all over the financial media. This is not some run-of-the-mill trial results and this is a tiny company whos life and death depend on how this is brought to fruition. I believe the publication brought out much more than was bargained for and they simply could not afford to dismiss the opportunity despite this lengthy cost. As much as investors wish reality was the fantasy they imagine, its simply not. But the end will justify the means, and the hand wringing will give way to the elation everyone wants right now. Dont sweat the wait, its illogical and sweating is succumbing to ones emotion. The big payoffs always reward those with the courage to see beyond what makes the pussies give in right before the reward. This is not some new concept.Shame on the hedgies for trying to run a company that is trying to cure cancer into the ground with their naked shorts.

GFS getting a little boost from Ford deal today. Shows just how critical chips are to various industries including Auto. 

But what i think the more important hidden message here is that GFS is becoming a play on the increased role the national security and geopolitics is going to play in terms of buying decisions. 

Making things here in America ensures supply for the future. You cant secure chip supply by being entirely reliant on china and taiwan. 

So. 

1) For the next 2-3 years we know demand is going to be robust as shortage gets addressed. That reduces risk around the Q earnings.

2) More importantly longer term GFS should grow faster than the market because of its US heritage. I would expect they continue to win business (ie market share) as US buyers factor supply chain risk and geopolitical considerations into their purchase decisions. 

3) And I would suspect lots of help from federal government to help GFS grow. This kind of business requires scale so its not reasonable to expect many small players to pop up.

Two interesting pieces of information discovered today that prove with certainty that GME is going to launch an NFTs marketplace and also launch our bank accounts into orbit. I also want to say that I don't take credit for these finds. They were discovered by people on another reddit board.

Piece 1) This github link from Gamestop which matches a another leak from Github

GME [https://ipfs.nft.gamestop.com/ipfs/QmPBvug4pYykDWosLUC7ReQo4vv1F9knd5fkTJr3bzPURp](https://ipfs.nft.gamestop.com/ipfs/QmPBvug4pYykDWosLUC7ReQo4vv1F9knd5fkTJr3bzPURp)

Of note, NFTs minting was added to the SDK roughly 24 hours ago.

Piece 2) I'm going to directly quote [u/dark\_stapler](https://www.reddit.com/user/dark_stapler/) from another board.

The PD-1 blocker market has exploded into place as one of the most  important and promising major biopharma oncology markets yet to appear.  Immuno-oncology drugs that block the checkpoint PD-1 have been some of  the most successful stories in the industry over recent years, launching  blockbuster drugs like Opdivo and Keytruda  central assets from  Bristol Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE:BMY) and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK),  respectively.

The blossoming of this category has been rapid and remarkable, and  fueled by a real and tangible need, resulting in the emergence of what  is now estimated to be a $23 billion market.

Per their recent 13F filing, Citadel just added about $7,000,000 worth of shorts on top of their total short position on TLRY, an increase of over 20%! It looks like they tried to hide this by waiting to increase their short position until after the short interest reporting date so it wouldn't be reported/counted as part of the total amount shorted in this period since that number is only reported twice a month.

They obviously didn't want us to notice this so here you go. Kinda explains a lot on what is going on and the weird volatility on Tilray (TLRY) throughout the trading days recently and especially the recent increase of the amount of TLRY shares traded in the dark pools.

1,"11/18/2021, 22:49:44",GAP Inc $GPS Short Interest Near 16% w. Yeezy Gap Collab and Raised Guidance,WarsStarKnightJedi37,"Very surprised to see GAP $GPS not trending with retail especially because of the raised guidance and the Yeezy GAP Collab being cited by Hypebeast as the collab of the year. Short Interest is currently near 16% with earnings due to be reported next week. Days to cover is over 4 and retail earnings across the board have been stellar so far this quarter. I am a long term holder of GAP and have acquired a large position. Giving that GAP has high short interest, is trading at a significant discount to other retailers, and is releasing earnings on November 23rd, I think this is a good opportunity to own a winner. I believe this stock can go to the moon....just look at Adidas stock since they partnered with Yeezy. Yeezus is upon us and he will propel GAP to new highs. There's many incentives for Ye if sales and stock performance meet certain levels.

Good luck all!  Let me know your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwrcz9/gap_inc_gps_short_interest_near_16_w_yeezy_gap/

1,"11/18/2021, 22:24:31",$AUR: Automating Your Portfolio with Self-driving Tech DeSPAC Play,Haten4Life,"Alrighty degenerates I got a play that will drive itself to profits. Ive been on the lookout for amazing deSPAC plays that have potential and this one takes the cake, pie, and pretty much all the goods you will ever purchase in the future into your hands. It's a self-driving vehicle technology business that's going to revolutionize the way we travel and move goods. Theyve partnered with all the big names like Uber, Fedex, Volvo, Denso, Toyota and trucking industry giant Paccar. To bring us everything from self driving taxis, cars to fully autonomous trucking industry that will define the future. And it's all being led by individuals that have made amazing advancements to self driving technology and now   have joined together to revolutionize the industry.

The DeSpac trend continues with recent deSpacs plays getting hyped and shit on daily. But they all tend to do one thing and it's one thing we can count on. And thats moving up in price once the information about the company is made aware to the masses. This isnt a low float play as far as I can tell. But that wont stop it from running and with the potential of this company that's a sure thing.

**Aurora Driver** \-designed to enable any vehicle from Class 8 trucks to regular cars to become autonomous and move safely and efficiently with human drivers which makes roads and the rides much safer without the possibility of human error.

**Aurora Connect**\- Driverless  Ride Hailing Service that will replace drivers for companies like Uber. Aurora Acquired Ubers self-driving unit, Advanced Technologies Group last year in order to get market share in the robotaxi marketspace.

**Aurora Horizon** \-Bringing autonomous driving to the trucking industry which will make it cheaper and more efficient to transport goods and cheaper as well without the need to pay for a driver which currently is around 50% about transporting costs. Which is going to make it more lucrative for the shipping industry. It's already on the road and making test runs that serving the needs of Fedex and more companies in the future will follow.

&amp;#x200B;

[Market Share Aurora has due partnerships ](https://preview.redd.it/cf0vb3ol5d081.png?width=1517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84a26a9433682c4db6697710229bcd24bddf5fa4)

Aurora is being led by the best Autonomous Driver Technology Innovators of the decade. Chris Urmson, previously head of the Google Self-Driving Car project, formed Aurora in 2017 with Sterling Anderson, who led Teslas Autopilot program, and Drew Bagnell, a Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist and former member of Ubers autonomous vehicle team, Uber ATG. These are the best people that the industry has to offer and they're all working together to take us to the future of Driverless Vehicles.

Now with this being a recently formed deSpac most of the float is under a lock-up agreement. And with share redemptions and other stuff that make a deSpac plays so enticing the float you see is not the actual float. If you don't know what that means, well, you're shit out of luck. I'm not going to explain how SPACs have huge floats and are allowed to have options traded on them, but then when they go through with a merger a lot of that float vanishes due to redemptions. Now I dont know the number of shares actually being traded because I'm not a lawyer and can only understand so much of 8-k filings before it goes over my head. But Im confident that the actual number of shares being traded is way less than stated.

My positions are 2500 shares, 100 15c Dec 17, 50 12.5c Dec 15c and 25 20c Mar 22. Now if you have big balls and want to go in on Nov 19 options that could work out aswell.

# [Stocks rise led by tech shares as Nvidia soars](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stocks rose after Nvidia, the worlds most valuable chipmaker, reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and gave a positive outlook.
*****
&gt; Dow futures rose 24 points, or 0.07%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.5%.
*****
&gt; Trading has been choppy this week with the major averages mostly wavering around the flat line, but the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are still on track for a positive week and are sitting less than 1% from their records. The Dow is 1.7% from its record.
*****
&gt; Nvidia shares popped more than 8% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results and issued a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter ending in January. The chipmaker reporter a 55% gain in data center sales from the same period a year ago and its biggest market, gaming, reported a 42% sales increase.
*****
&gt; Those gains helped lift other chip stocks in early morning trading. Advanced Micro Devices gained 2% while Skyworks and Micron Technology added more than 1%.
*****
&gt; Retail continued its big earnings week. Shares of Macys and Kohls kicked the day off jumping 11% and 7%, respectively. Both companies smashed quarterly profit and revenue estimates, much like its peers who reported earlier in the week. Most have reported same-store sales gains from the previous year and investors are optimistic going into the holiday shopping season.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Deere saw its shares rise more than 1% after it came to a resolution with workers who had been on strike since Oct. 14.
*****
&gt; Dow component Boeing also saw its shares rise another almost 2% following on upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the aerospace giant has significant upside as it clears up several issues that have dogged the company.
*****
&gt; Going in the other direction, Cisco Systems fell 5% due to weaker revenue guidance and a revenue miss. Kraft Heinz shares also dropped more than 2% after the company announced a secondary offering of common stock.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 211 points, dragged down by a 4.7% loss in Visa shares. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.26%. The Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.33% lower, despite most mega-cap technology companies closing in the green.
*****
&gt; The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer on Wednesday, dropping 1.2%.
*****
&gt; Recent economic reports remain strong, but todays stock market action highlights that it is already discounting another Covid cycle, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; Concerns about Covid also caused the 10-year bond yield to decline for the first time in 6 days and kept downward pressure on commodity prices including another sizable drop in crude oil prices. If inflation keeps rising while another Covid surge again stalls real economic activity, we may find out how the stock market handles a pseudo-stagflationary episode, he added.
*****
&gt; Investors await more retail earnings on Thursday with Applied Materials and Palo Alto Networks reporting after the bell.
*****
&gt; The Labor Department will report last weeks jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting initial filings for unemployment insurance fell to 260,000 for the week ending November 13, from the previous weeks 267,000 claims.

Most of my friends already use it so I can't send it to them, I was hoping if anybody here was thinking about getting Revolut or just to help a guy out they could use this link to sign up. It will really really help me financially right now, and I would really appreciate it. 

The upside for you is it's a got a decent trading platform, of course it is a visa bank account that also has a digital disposable card for safer online paying, and the major upside is no transfer or spending fees when you are paying abroad! The steps to be completed do include ordering a physical card which obviously costs you a small bit...but my idea is if anyone was gonna get it anyway or now feel they want it, please use my link :)  You'll have to use your phone I think to open it and get the app.

Premarket explanation video below in comments 

Goodmorning traders, thats right yes, I am looking for, seeing and hoping for a rally to short into. I said a couple days ago that since the weekly timeframe has entered into overbought condition, we can now focus on the daily timeframe. In order to get a pullback, the daily chart will need to go into an overbought condition and to do it and do it soon we need a rally to push above the all-time high give us a bearish divergence. Thanks to Nvidia earnings and tesla being tesla we should get just that.

1) Trend up day structure. we open gap up we find support between 468.68 to 468.14. We will see a little more sideways action at 468 today before taking off toward 472. We stop and get our midday chop around 470 or so. We start the second half of the day with a slight pullback before resume trend up. **50% probability**

Memestocks tend to run every 90 days. The 90 days are up next week and memestocks are about to run in my opinion.

I've thrown \~10k on Popcorn stock &amp; another 12k on Game retailer stock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# [Let's go | Section #1]

# When do MemeStocks start to run?

Once every 90 days, memestocks run and they run for 2 weeks and then die off. Here's the calendar that covers the majority of memestocks.

**Which months**

1. February
2. May
3. August
4. November

**Which days**

1. Find the 3'rd Friday of that month.
2. The next tuesday, there's a big mega candle for the main meme stocks &amp; a smaller runup for the lesser meme stocks.

The run lasts maximum 2 weeks and then dies off.

&amp;#x200B;

# November is Here &amp; So is the Next Meme Run

The next meme stock runup starts next week around Tuesday. Here's a map showing the amount of gamma that needs to be hedged &amp; where the price wants to go on every meme stock runup.

I'm going to list 2 main meme stocks vs a non memestock to see the difference.

**Here's a Popcorn retailer**

&amp;#x200B;

# The Anatomy of a Meme Stock Run

Here's the last 3 runs for the unmentionable game reseller.

I've graphed out the dates where monthly and quarterly option clearing happens as well as when futures are rolled &amp; expired.

All these are big drivers for meme stocks and are what drive them up and down.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) February 23**

https://preview.redd.it/1vm1ftlrwc081.png?width=2113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e818458afa0d33771198ef0cca98f532230cf55

* **Deposit Period**
   * This cycle had a distinct dip the 3 days during the monthly options clearing deposit period 17-19 February.
* **Runup Day**
   * Next week, this cycle was ""supposed"" to happen on Tuesday the 23'rd, but it instead was delayed by +1 day and it instead start on February 24, a Wednesday.
* **Drop Day**
   * As usual, during March 10, the price dropped.
* **Bonus Anomaly**
   * The only weird thing about last February was that Monday the 15'th of February was a Bank Holiday &amp; exchanges were closed. It's unknown whether this played a role.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) May 25**

https://preview.redd.it/3rxw95yswc081.png?width=2114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72242f90608ecdbc7bff4259b32c08f02e28de84

* **-1 Week Before the Deposit Period**
   * This cycle had a tiny warmup run the week before. Unknown why.
* **Deposit Period**
   * The 2 days before the monthly options clearing deposit deadline (Friday), the price did it's usual and obvious drop.
* **Runup Day**
   * The next week just in time on May 25, Tuesday, the price ran up as expected. The next day it even gapped up a bit
* **Drop Day**
   * The price predictably dropped around the futures roll on June 9-10 ish.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3) August 24**

https://preview.redd.it/rcbx9brtwc081.png?width=2116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ee4ee7b44bc2792ce39530133df8d02170d26d

* **-1 Week Before the Deposit Period**
   * This cycle had a tiny warmup run the week before. Unknown why.
* **Deposit Period**
   * The 2 days of the monthly options clearing deposit period again had a perfectly ""normal"" dip as usual.
* **Runup Day**
   * The next week, exactly on schedule, on August 24, a Tuesday, the price of this stock ran up. And that was it. It was all sideways after that.
* **Drop Day**
   * The futures roll drop was extremely delayed and happened around the 21'st ish of September instead of around the 8'th ish honestly, not sure if it happened at all or in what capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

# What Every 90 Day Cycle Has in Common - Section 2

*Here's commonalities and difference between the last 3 cycles and what the 4'th one might look like or in my opinion will likely look like.*

\-------------------------------------

# In 2 out of 3 cycles, the following happened

Here's what's common in 2 out of 3 runups:

&amp;#x200B;

* **1 Week Before the Deposit Period -** The price does a tiny warmup run.
* **Runup Day -** The price ran up exactly on Tuesday as per NSCC/OCC option clearing rules.
* **Drop Day -** The price dropped significantly.

This pattern begins &amp; continues repeating starting from Ryan Cohen's buy-in around August 2020 without fail.

https://preview.redd.it/9zrbuaavwc081.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebfee655bf411d0e6a3374f8237898e4b1d3bc3b

&amp;#x200B;

# The Next Cycle - Section 3

# The November Cycle &amp; It's Shape

In this section i'll be telling you what the November section will look like if one even happens. It's an estimated image based on the previous cycles.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the past 3 cycles as well as some additional data &amp; experience having gone through those cycles and vividly remembering them, the following is my estimate on how the next runup will look like.

https://preview.redd.it/cjfoba7xwc081.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab85d80a2d11a8b22e49fa26e03830e80a83ab47

As always, this is a vague estimation and not indicative of what the price runup will be. We could go higher or lower or nowhere at all.

I thin Game retailing stock could touch $240-$290 whilst pocorn stock might touch $50-$60 ish. Not too bad.

To what extent new asset classes that aren't backed by real-economy elements (such as land, cashflows, metals) could be helping central banks to expand the monetary base while keeping interest rates low, since the volume of money that flows inside these markets is kept out of the real economy, and is not captured by any inflation indexes that should drive the monetary policy?

I'll instead give you a big TLDR.

# [Let's go | Section #1]

# Finding a Generic Game Retailer Cycle/Runup - The Mega TLDR

It's so easy it's dumb that it's so easy to figure out. I'm going to spoon feed you how to know the exact date of every future Meme Stock cycle/runup/green candle dong in this section.

**Which months**

1. February
2. May
3. August
4. November

**Which days**

1. Find the 3'rd Friday of that month.
2. The next tuesday, there's a big mega candle for the main meme stocks &amp; a smaller runup for the lesser meme stocks.

The run lasts maximum 2 weeks and then dies off.

&amp;#x200B;

# November is Here &amp; So is the Next Meme Run

The next meme stock runup starts next week around Tuesday. Here's a map showing the amount of gamma that needs to be hedged &amp; where the price wants to go on every meme stock runup.

I'm going to list 2 main meme stocks vs a non memestock to see the difference.

**Here's a Popcorn retailer**

[Gamma Neutral when this thing runs as at around $1000](https://preview.redd.it/snlg3ynhjc081.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=929361f1d699f9e5fb0979420a53d586317536ea)

**Here's a Generic Retailer**

[This is a sad stock and not memey at all.](https://preview.redd.it/616i1dpmjc081.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe763a406e56a5fe146f796fa6f052e1ec6e8669)

&amp;#x200B;

# The Anatomy of a Meme Stock Run

Here's the last 3 runs for generic game reseller. 

I've graphed out the dates where monthly and quarterly option clearing happens as well as when futures are rolled &amp; expired. 

All these are big drivers for meme stocks and are what drive them up and down.

&amp;#x200B;

 **1) February 23** 

https://preview.redd.it/149sy4exjc081.png?width=2113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ada173163fedbf92f4638ad25f333fa22226042d

* **Deposit Period**
   * This cycle had a distinct dip the 3 days during the monthly options clearing deposit period 17-19 February.
* **Runup Day**
   * Next week, this cycle was ""supposed"" to happen on Tuesday the 23'rd, but it instead was delayed by +1 day and it instead start on February 24, a Wednesday.
* **Drop Day**
   * As usual, during March 10, the price dropped.
* **Bonus Anomaly**
   * The only weird thing about last February was that Monday the 15'th of February was a Bank Holiday &amp; exchanges were closed. It's unknown whether this played a role.

&amp;#x200B;

 **2) May 25** 

https://preview.redd.it/7300jp1yjc081.png?width=2114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871c10b7b100d3f79b6048f3939207a3bf8c2db8

* **-1 Week Before the Deposit Period**
   * This cycle had a tiny warmup run the week before. Unknown why.
* **Deposit Period**
   * The 2 days before the monthly options clearing deposit deadline (Friday), the price did it's usual and obvious drop.
* **Runup Day**
   * The next week just in time on May 25, Tuesday, the price ran up as expected. The next day it even gapped up a bit
* **Drop Day**
   * The price predictably dropped around the futures roll on June 9-10 ish.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 **3) August 24** 

https://preview.redd.it/vn6s5zzzjc081.png?width=2116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afb662837a8a57d79e9442bde2f5e5532e3a52e9

* **-1 Week Before the Deposit Period**
   * This cycle had a tiny warmup run the week before. Unknown why.
* **Deposit Period**
   * The 2 days of the monthly options clearing deposit period again had a perfectly ""normal"" dip as usual.
* **Runup Day**
   * The next week, exactly on schedule, on August 24, a Tuesday, the price of this stock ran up. And that was it. It was all sideways after that.
* **Drop Day**
   * The futures roll drop was extremely delayed and happened around the 21'st ish of September instead of around the 8'th ish honestly, not sure if it happened at all or in what capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

# What Every 90 Day Cycle Has in Common - Section 2

*Here's commonalities and difference between the last 3 cycles and what the 4'th one might look like or in my opinion will likely look like.*

\-------------------------------------

# In 2 out of 3 cycles, the following happened

Here's what's common in 2 out of 3 runups:

&amp;#x200B;

* **1 Week Before the Deposit Period -** The price does a tiny warmup run.
* **Runup Day -** The price ran up exactly on Tuesday as per NSCC/OCC option clearing rules.
* **Drop Day -** The price dropped significantly.

This pattern begins &amp; continues repeating starting from Ryan Cohen's buy-in around August 2020 without fail.

[Look at August onwards where the new chairman came in and bought a big chunk of company shares. The repeating 90 days quarterly runup pattern begun there.](https://preview.redd.it/23nhaq5lkc081.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af6088f5d7e02fbdebd39f975d39a5139c149d66)

&amp;#x200B;

# The Next Cycle - Section 3

# The November Cycle &amp; It's Shape

In this section i'll be telling you what the November section will look like if one even happens. It's an estimated image based on the previous cycles.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the past 3 cycles as well as some additional data &amp; experience having gone through those cycles and vividly remembering them, the following is my estimate on how the next runup will look like.

https://preview.redd.it/5iu6ezerkc081.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e4957d2920c6fa3db742ccfe1125dd7e83bffd

As always, this is a vague estimation and not indicative of what the price runup will be. We could go higher or lower or nowhere at all. 

The runup could be to $250 or $300 or a bit more. My bets are on $240-$290 ish. Anything more is a big bonus.

I do expect the usual drop when futures are rolled over as that's the same day as earnings and this company always dumps on earnings and it has dumped for the past 10 earnings calls. 

There's talk that this might be one time that it doesn't. Who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

# What's the Move - Section 3

# Picking your Option Strikes

I use my own tools to figure out which option strikes to pick and when. In this section i'm going to show you what those tools say are good picks only and only for next week's runup. I picked my own options based on what this tool spat out.

The suite of tools i use is from Hoadley Net. They're a bit complicated and took me a while to understand how to use them.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

# Finding Implied &amp; Historical Volatility

I first use a tool that tells me the Historical volatility &amp; Implied Volatility for the next 15 Trading Days e.g when this stock will do it's quarterly runup.

https://preview.redd.it/s9bwxjh9lc081.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f67e636bc80600f9b481f7d7d3d0f5c5d1cbb98

The tool spits out

1. 93% Average,
2. 99% Upper
3. 96% for strikes between 200-290 for the next 15 trading days.

I averaged these in my head and decided that i'll use 95% average volatility as my number in the next tool which will tell me which Game Retailer options are theoretically cheap/mispriced/on sale or whatever you'd want to call it.

You can find these volatilties online on Yahoo Finance or other websites. I use this tool because it makes my life easier.

&amp;#x200B;

# Option Valuation Analysis

I use the 95% current IV from the previous section to plug in into the next tool called the Valuation Analysis tool. Using this IV as a base number, the tool tells you which options are **underpriced** or **overpriced**.

If you use the incorrect data here, you'll get the wrong numbers and wrong valuations and will end up buying the wrong options.

Let's move onto next week expiring options.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nov 26 Expiring Options**

https://preview.redd.it/ltgl0nfblc081.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7db9fa5e6b1a4bcf0a69f0dc2c7130c755981e8

I've added a red boarder around the strikes that interest me. I'm not interested in anything outside this box as it's either overpriced, has little delta, overly high IV which will make me lose money and other variables.

I picked my strike within a similar box, but slightly expanded to $255 because IV was low last week, now anything aboe $235 is no longer viable in my opinion. That's just my opinion. You do you.

Nov 26 is risky, but doable. I'm playing this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dec 03 Expiring Options**

https://preview.redd.it/cm3e8j0dlc081.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7500d3062cc1875892b63eb46ee34d3582a3dc37

I've added the main boarder around the strikes i enjoy. Same as the previous section. I mention Dec 03 because it's ""safer"" if there is such a thing with financial instruments. This is for the risk averse people.

Alternatively the next best thing is to get leaps / long term calls 6 Months, 1 or 2 year expiring calls.

This section is to show what i've picked for the current November runup. I already own several ITM leaps.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus Chart**

[Combined IV for calls and puts.](https://preview.redd.it/xmrqzvpflc081.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=370cc5705375766737949a4474361a021dab6b0d)

&amp;#x200B;

# Closing Comments Regarding Options

As the price of Game Retailer moves up and time passes, the IV will increase, Deltas will change, option pricing will change and the above data will NO LONGER be indicative of real market prices. Option prices literally change from day to day, hour to hour and so on.

You must not buy buy anything based on the above strikes as the option prices shown here are based on YESTERDAY's DATA. It's out of date by +2 days. You'll need to do your own research to find the correct strikes based on IV/Delta/Vega etc.

I use these cycles to make money to buy more Game Retailer but i'm a degenerate and love risk. I've lost and won a lot of money on options.

&amp;#x200B;

This was money I was **completely comfortable losing** if it happened however, I wanted to take playing options seriously.  My approach had been pretty conservative (for the most part) overall and prior to yesterday, I'd really have more or less a I've taken on a \~10% gain. 

My main goal was to profit 70% of the time and limit myself to no more than 10 trades a month.  Ideally, for 12 months, I was hoping to make $50k.  The goal was to aim for singles and doubles (baseball reference), however, every once and awhile a homerun happens.

I made \~$70k on Tesla yesterday.  Back in September, I made \~$10k giving me $82,755 in profit.  With everything added together, I have a 51% rate of return.

after benfitting massively from WSB, allow me to try to give back by sharing this investment idea:

Mynaric is a german company specializing in ""SPACE LASERS"" that was IPO'ed on Nasdaq last week.  
SEC Filings here: [https://mynaric.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/](https://mynaric.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/)

Their USP is a mass production ready system of ""Laser Towers"" for sattelites that can transmit data at 100gbit/s over 2.500km, to other sattelites or high flying drones.

Laser Constellations in low orbit can potentially replace the current, land based backbone infrastructure of the internet. Fiber Optics are nothing but ""gardenhoses for lasers"",  so the logical next step is going ""Space Laser Mesh"" rather than tedious sea cables or whatever.  


Communications between these communications will be a mesh of lasers. Starlink started with RF(RadioFrequency), but has moved to internally produced laser systems in a first testing phase.  


Does the Mynaric Technology check out?  
It appears to ""check out"" good enough for the US Government to force the German Government to ban Mynaric from Export, which led Mynaric to cease all business Activity in China -&gt; [https://mynaric.com/news/mynaric-announces-immediate-cease-of-business-activity-in-chinese-market/](https://mynaric.com/news/mynaric-announces-immediate-cease-of-business-activity-in-chinese-market/)  
It seems clear that the US Government wants to utilize this technology themselves, as visible from the Northrop Grumman Announcement 

[https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-selects-mynaric-as-strategic-supplier-of-space-laser-communications/](https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-selects-mynaric-as-strategic-supplier-of-space-laser-communications/)

Who are the players?

Microsoft is teaming up with Starlink/Space-X  
Amazon is teaming up with, \*surprise\*, Blue Origin  
Samsung is playing a game here too through ""OneWeb""  
Facebook has been playing the ""sky baloon"" game, unclear where they are headed.  
The Pentagon/DOD is already actively rolling out a constellation, planning up to 3 independent sattelite constellations. They have provided a contract to Mynaric. Northrop Grumman has signed a contract with Mynaric to be a preferred supplier with 35m+ revenue assurances.

But Volkswagen sells around 10 mio. cars in a year and Rivian havent sold any cars at all. I Think thats the great thing about them. Cars cause problems all the time. VW had problems with wrong emission data in their cars for example. Tesla faces investigation, because a Tesla-Owner had problems. Batteries in electric cars tend to burn very long. Mercedes called for a return of nearly 850.000 cars, because of a possibility of them starting to burn. And these are just a few examples.

So I guess you could say simply not selling any cars is a big plus, because with building cars you're also building lots of problems. And so I think there is still great opportunity for the stock to go up.

Theyre also DISTRIBUTED meaning they dont pile a ton of sensors on a single satellite, they spread them out making them less vulnerable.

- Spire uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).  Militaries have been using this for years - its an unwieldy strategic asset that tracks big metal things moving on the surface of the earth.  

Right now Spire is using SAR to track merchant ships and assisting in fuel consumption analysis for shipping companies but

We have an American company that has put a strategic military use asses in space, distributed in a fashion that makes it nearly impossible to shoot down.

1,"11/18/2021, 16:31:20",Polestar The only global EV pure play alongside Tesla,Ambitious-Cake9404,"They say to never trust an anonymous blogger on the internet. And I am an anonymous blogger. I have my reasons for remaining anonymous, and those reasons don't matter. Can you really trust articles on Bloomberg or Wall Street Journal any more than an anonymous opinion? All I ask is to debate the content of my message. Not who I am or my motivations. If you agree with what I say and think that it's in-depth, quality and truthful work, then make sure to share this on every retail channel available to you. Reddit, Discord, Stocktwits, Twitter, Telegram, Whatsapp, Tiktok and wherever else. If these ideas go viral, retail can make a lot of money at the expense of dirty shorter tactics, hedge funds and other HFT traders. 

The two stocks that I think are ripe for a gamma squeeze are Gores Guggenheim, Inc. (GGPI) a.k.a. the ""Polestar SPAC"" and Cassava Sciences, Inc. (SAVA). I believe that they are going to squeeze for very different reasons, but squeeze nonetheless. 

First off GGPI. GGPI is in the right industry as it will be merging with Polestar, an electric vehicle company that is further along than recent IPOs like SEV, RIVN, LCID and FSR. Despite that, at GGPI at $15, Polestar's $30 billion post-merger valuation is less than half of most of these companies. A blog post on Seeking Alpha with a target of $35 puts forth a straightforward fundamental argument for going long GGPI: 





















CCIV, the former SPAC shell for LCID, ran from $10 to $63 in a little over a month in January, and started off eerily similarly to how GGPI is trading now:


















CCIV was considered overvalued at the time and did crash post-merger, but LCID has since come roaring back to challenge the highs it made as CCIV. This is a blueprint for GGPI, with $35 being a decent target based on effective valuation as well as float as GGPI has 80 million shares outstanding. 

But the gamma squeeze potential is what needs to be addressed here for the short term gains I expect over the next couple of days. The funds have been trying hard to keep GGPI under $15, and for good reason. This is a screen shot of the call options outstanding for November's expiry:


















Each strike price above $10 has tens of thousands of options outstanding. A couple of weeks ago when many of those options were written, the $10's were expected to be slightly in-the-money while the $12.50's out-of-the-money. Both of these options will be deeply in the money. They combine for 37,408 contracts, representing 3.74 million shares that must be presented to call option holders.

Two questions will come up to debate this. 

1. The retail option holders will likely sell their options in order to avoid taking possession of the stock and running into margin issues. 

Yes and no. When you look at the volume compared to the open interest, only a small percentage of in-the-money call option holders are closing off their trades. There are only two trading days left before expiry and with that small volume relative to the open interest, I don't expect that open interest to decrease. Plus the call option seller isn't necessarily selling back to a call option writer. It could be a third party who is buying the option and wants to take possession of the stock instead of buying on the open market for whatever reason, and the call option writer is still obligated to sell the shares to them. 

2. The volume of shares that this represents is still only a small part of the trading volume, so it should be easily absorbed. 

This is an issue with high frequency and bot trading. The 80 million share float has flipped over three times in the last four days. This is highly indicative of HFT traders selling to each other repeatedly in order to spoof the volume and make it look like the covering of any shorts or presentation of any shares from option writing is no big deal. Two firms could sell 100,000 shares back and forth to each other in mirrored bot programs dozens of times a day. The 3.74 million shares that must be presented in a real transaction that has to take place. It's 5% of the float which is pretty significant and can cause a gamma run that can't be hidden behind large volume. In fact, large volume only hurts them as large volume and increasing share price is a very bullish signal for retail traders. 

The $15 strikes and higher are where the option writers can come into a world of hurt. And this is why they have been working so hard to keep the $15 resistance. An additional 20,884 in open interest, representing over 2 million shares would need to be presented to option holders if GGPI lands over $15. There's an additional 3 million shares worth at the three price intervals above $15 up to $22.5. If this was to run, it would be similar to what we have seen on IONQ in the last couple of days. IONQ wasn't looking too hopeful immediately after its earning report when it was trading in the $18's after hours. That was the market makers trying and failing to keep a lid on that stock price at $20. IONQ's $20 is GGPI's $15. If GGPI breaks $15, it's off to the races. Especially since the same funds tend to work across multiple SPACs. So if they are hurting on IONQ, they are more vulnerable on GGPI. 

Next, SAVA. This one is very different in that it already had a squeeze but then shorters took it down. SAVA disclosed in a recent filing that government agencies are investigating the company, without any implications of any wrong doing. The shorters then had their pals at the Wall Street Journal pick up the already disclosed ""scoop"" to tank the stock some more. At 9am the article came out and tanked the stock about $10 on very little volume. The stock didn't recover and spent the day in the mid-$40's to mid-$50's. This is textbook manipulation and it's to let the heavy shorts who were badly burned and very wrong in the previous two weeks, out with minimal losses. Volume was greater today than the last few days, but was only a small percentage of the volume that occurred in early November when SAVA squeezed. 

Short interest is a very heavy 30% and if the shorts are smart, they will cover while the covering is good. This is where a gamma squeeze effect could occur, with $50 being the key level as the bulk of the option activity occurred at this level. This implies max pain at $50, but if short covering brings it beyond that level,  those calls expire in the money while the puts expire worthless. That will force the hand of call option writers to present longs with the stock. 






 












This analysis isn't nearly as in depth as GGPI, but I don't think it needs to be. This was some dirty trickery by the shorts to try to get out of their positions with minimal losses, and getting out is likely their course of action for the majority of them.

1,"11/18/2021, 16:06:05",BLNK DD,jmart8999,"Hey guys Im up late being a $BLNK DD autist.  Ive thought this a squeeze has been brewing here for awhile, yet was in need of a catalyst for short capitulation, and I think we got it with earning last week.  I now think the squeeze is imminent here beginning this Thursday or Friday, or early next week.  Here are a few reasons why:

		The BLNK options chain is showing us that the price for BLNK is getting very supportive in the near term.  As of close on Wed 11/17, when BLNK closed above $46, strikes expiring 11/19 are as follows:
        11/19 $25-46 ITM calls - 22,349
        11/19 $47-70 OTM calls - 4,419
        11/19 $47-70 ITM puts - 410
        11/19 $25-46 OTM puts - 18,389
	1.	Typically I like to stay away from weekly expiries, and especially monthly expiries because theres usually a lot of pressure on tickers in whichever direction because of OTM exposure that will close positions at any price so that it doesnt expire worthless.  Here, you have the opposite effect, much like GME in January.  ITM calls and OTM puts are supportive of price headed into expiry, while OTM calls and ITM puts put pressure on price headed into expiry.  As you can see here, there are over 40,000 contracts here that are supportive of price headed into Friday, and just 4,829 contracts that will put pressure on price.
		As you keep digging, you already know that there are 40k ITM contracts expiring in 36 hours.  Do that math and youll realize that 11.2% of the entire float needs to be delivered to ITM contract holders early next week.
		A quick check and youll learn that between Mutual Fund Holders, Institutional Investors, and Individual Stakeholders, they own 54.5% of the company.
		36.1% of BLNKs shares were sold short at the 10/29 filing.
		Add these three metrics up, and you get 101.8% of BLNKs shares are owned or sold short, which is all PRICE SUPPORTIVE.
		Remember, in a situation like this, typically the Gamma Squeeze comes BEFORE the short squeeze.  In this situation weve got MMs that absolutely need to be buying over the next three sessions unless the price gets pushed below $40ish if they cant do that, and $50 cracks, the gamma squeeze will absolutely be own, and the short squeeze will follow.

*TLDR - There isnt much resistance left in the BLNK chain, which will cause a gamma squeeze, followed by the short squeeze, as its the sixth most shorted stock on the market.

Recently I've had quite a bit of interest in ""coin"" mining stocks. I find this sector interesting, because although mining isn't really a competitive environment companies value does not scale equally with their hashrates.

To calculate short term price targets, I calculated an average MarketCap/Hashrate of the 7 companies. I then calculated and average MarketCap/ExpectedHashrate. I then scaled the current price of the stock (based on average of the seven), weighting 20% to expected hashrate and 80% to current hashrate.

To calculate long term price targets, I am simply dividing the *average* current hashrate by the company's expected hashrate, and scaling the price accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

I am by no means bearish on RIOT, MARA, or HUT. The reason the three stocks are showing significant decreases in the short term is simply because they are valued much higher per hashrate than their peers.

This isn't a situation where one should think ""the bigger company wins"" each company takes their fair share for the blocks they mine.

**Closing remarks:**

All mining companies look insanely low priced compared to their 2022 capabilities.

Some companies look better in both the short and long term.

1,"11/18/2021, 15:51:54",Mining Stocks Are Incredibly Underpriced,kg360,"TLDR: Mining stocks look juicy for 2022.

Recently I've had quite a bit of interest in ""coin"" mining stocks.  I find this sector interesting, because although mining isn't really a competitive environment companies value does not scale equally with their hashrates.  I decided to dive a little deeper into these stocks to see which ones are the best investments for both short and long terms. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f7cdldz05b081.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7fb12d6af277af491785ca22a5d26d384817bdc

To calculate short term price targets, I calculated an average MarketCap/Hashrate of the 7 companies.  I then calculated and average MarketCap/ExpectedHashrate.  I then scaled the current price of the stock, weighting 20% to expected hashrate and 80% to current hashrate.

To calculate long term price targets, I am simply dividing the *average* current hashrate by the company's expected hashrate, and scaling the price accordingly.

I also hope I'm wrong about this and lose money.  Dr Fauci and president Biden have both come out and used the term ""Dark Winter"".  Operation Dark Winter was a simulation of a smallpox outbreak back in 2001.  Bill Gates has recently mentioned smallpox several times, saying that it would be devastating if it were to be released at several airports around the world.  

The virus smallpox is only allowed to be stored at (2) places in the entire world.  Atlanta, USA and Russia.  Recently there were vials found in a Pennsylvania lab's freezer which the FBI is investigating.  There is a new ""monkeypox"" case that just popped up in Maryland.  The treatment for monkeypox is the smallpox vaccine.  Recently the US gov't purchased $113M in smallpox vaccines from SIGA to up their preparedness just in case they need it.  SIGA stock is up close to 20% in just 5 days with low volume.

Everything listed here is factual, and not conspiracy.  If in fact smallpox or monkeypox does appear to break out...SIGA is the play.  Disclaimer: I bought a measly $400 in stock and options today.

1,"11/18/2021, 14:34:13",GRAND FATHER TO ALL $CLOV THESIS,blueberrydanishguy,"Before I start, lets clear out two things. First, CLOV haters please downvote and post your shitty comments ,and leave asap and second I do own CLOV my cp is \~6.85 and have 5 digit shares. Okay  now let's start!

&amp;#x200B;

* Let's start with $300 mill share offering. CLOV has $442 mill cash on hand (Table 1 - that's a lot cash on hand when comparing it to near competitors). Then why they need more money, (guessing) since their balance sheet is pretty good and have very low ratio (in relevant factors listed in Table 2), I THINK IT HAS to do with Direct Contracting expenses for 2022 (which is a good excuse). DC's cost of revenue is more than 52 percent of their total cost of revenue (Ref Table 3) and their target of DOUBLING DC in 2022, it makes sense to have more cash on hand to support the exponential growth and cost. They could have issued more debt (as they have very little in the first place) but they didn't, I am guessing it is because debt is going to be more and more expensive starting 2022 as FED raises interest rates and take other steps to curb inflationary pressures.

[Table 1: CLOV Cash over last couple quarters](https://preview.redd.it/aq07c0hrma081.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1afb3d176268b7ab18da43d1bda32f31734db730)

&amp;#x200B;

[Table 2: CLOV vs Comp Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/5ocprx0tna081.png?width=1640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b52652c3657b2697a506dca56ca69f717e06b7e)

[Table 3: CLOV's Cost of Revenue Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/hfi48osana081.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=366ddb0be70d55c832c38fc75a5132fb0bab26e4)

&amp;#x200B;

* CLOV has very high Implied Volatility. CLOV's implied one year volatility is 98 percent vs 37 percent (comps  average) as shown in Table 4. This is good and bad explaining pumps and dumps but because this is no WISH or PLTR, I believe a bigger and consistent pump is more likely.

&amp;#x200B;

[Table 4: CLOV and its Comp - 12 month IV's](https://preview.redd.it/4c8vmmt5pa081.png?width=1654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36679049efd6a56ad043c1bd733db1eb3805f6f2)

* HIGH SHORT INTEREST. CLOV's short interest is 3x the average daily volume and 13.5 percent of float, as of Oct 29. Hate to be typical WSB pumper, IT HAS POTENTIAL FOR A SHORT SQUEEZE

&amp;#x200B;

[Table 5: CLOV's Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/0kl0mqatpa081.png?width=1656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b2a9f1c62ecfe8d501b4edec19564faa0b8b17d)

*  Increased revenue estimates (Table 6 - very good news). CLOV's consensus 2022 revenue estimated increased 3.3 percent to $2.3B in the past month. Bigger hedges are realizing this company is actually good on delivering what it says. As revenue estimates go up month by month, it's more and more good news for CLOV's fundamental value. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Table 6: CLOV's Revenue Targets](https://preview.redd.it/i1w1wd49qa081.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0b3eae48441ca0abd3c338ba8ed035ae91e232c)

* High Sales Growth vs Comps. CLOV's consensus 3 year estimated sales CAGR is 62 percent vs 16.1 percent for comp average (Table 7 - AWESOME !). If you don't know what is CAGR, it is the best formula for evaluating how different investments have performed over time. Hence, explaining the hyper growth element behind CLOV.

&amp;#x200B;

[Table 7: CLOV's Sales CAGR](https://preview.redd.it/cjnxl3cqqa081.png?width=1624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34de6acd6cf5f8484df9a5bb030d8e5e52f15f3b)

Overall, there is bad stuff out there about CLOV like low operating margin, recent management changes - 13 of 14 exec and 5 of 7 board member are less 1 year in their role, negative yield compared to NASDAQ Healthcare Index. We can't deny these and we shouldn't. Every company has negative elements but focus for this post is on positive elements. I trust the process and have faith in CLOV.

Today,

I gotten popcorn, and going to watch, the army of shorts that been shorting this stock, they been fighting all day to keep it down under $1

EVERY time good news were announced, for years.  To keep this down company that trying their best to provide new delivery system of medication thru micro needles + new and best medication for migraines. 

I watched this company go from $2+ down to .30 cents and back up, and not selling.  Multiple times.  It thought me a hard lesson.  HOLD + Not Care what price is.  I know where this company is going.

Its to the moon.  I am proud i been holding this stock, and averaging as much, as my average wage as worker can.

Most of all, i am looking forward to when they release migraine medication, so that my wife might actually have proper treatment, she gets really bad migraines, its hard to watch her in pain and normal pain medication not helping.  Its also main reason i invested, and sold ALL my other stocks.  In last 2 years, and invested everything into ZSAN. 

So yeah, Diamond Hands Till Forever.  Now i am going to Watch all these shorts burn in hell and be first in line with my wife to get treatment with this medication M207 aka Qtrypta.

I want to talk about $VIAC and why it's going to make you MONEY!!!

First off, what is $VIAC and what does it include?

1.  CBS- one of the most watched cable networks

2.  Paramount Pictures- makers of the most currently watched tv show ""Yellowstone"" and movies like a Quiet Place and wolf of wall street

3.  Showtime-Premium TV network with many top originals that also does boxing events such as the recent Canelo fight. Also includes Bellator, which has been growing and is the only real competition to UFC.

4.  Includes other Networks like MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, BET-which Im sure most of you are familiarly with.

5.  Pluto TV- basically like free cable with a large selection of channels. Just tried it out for the first time today and it seems legit, you dont even need an account to watch. Pluto TV revenue numbers are up 77.7% year over year.

6.  Paramount Plus, it has one of the largest content libraries for shows and movies. Also has deals with NFL, European Soccer Leagues, PGA (golf) and more. Also, paramount plus was one of the most download apps in the apple app store recently. They Also plan on releasing an exclusive movie each week in 2022. [https://www.cbr.com/paramount-plus-debut-new-movie-every-week-2022/](https://www.cbr.com/paramount-plus-debut-new-movie-every-week-2022/)

Lets talk about upcoming catalyst.

1.  VIAC just announced they added 1 million subs on P+ in the last week. Netflix added 4.4 in all of Q3. 

2. This stock also has a small chance of announcing a buy out at any given time. Would be a great target for Amazon or Apple.  

Bonus, according to Nasdaq the Institutional Stock &amp; Mutual Fund Ownership is 68.2%. and the Short interest is around 8%. I believe the rebound from the selling pressure happened today, shorts will start to cover and with the low average volume they should drive the price up.

There's a lot of other great points I missed, these are just some of things that come to my mind. I would recommend spending some time looking into VIAC yourself. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

I'm holding 15 leaps and just bought 40 35C expiring next week. IMO 35 is the lowest we will go anytime soon. 

TL;DR if you want to make some money buy VIAC Shares or Leaps, Fundamentals are as solid as an Applebees steak yet lots of growth potential.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwhdmb/why_you_should_buy_viac_today/

1,"11/18/2021, 11:21:50",Not Another GOEV Movie: Grab Your Koch and Popcorn,mmanofsteel86,"Hi. Much like a mix between the CEO and some Chinese takeout, I'll keep this short and sweet - never really sour.  As many of you may know, Tiny Tony Tequila (TTT for brevity) is the CEO and Executive Chairman of Canoo Technologies - an EV company with a market cap in billions of dollars the size of the length of the average male appendage in inches: 2.5

Canoo was in the news this week due to a solid earnings call where they noted they expect to not only meet, but actually exceed expectations in ramping the start of production of their first salable vehicles. The other news you may have heard is the swirling rumors of a love triangle between Canoo, Walmart, and AI start-up [Gatik](https://gatik.ai/).  

As a quick recap: Canoo announced they are moving their HQ to Bentonville, Arkansas (hometown of Walmart).  Gatik and Walmart are known [partners](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/gatik-driverless-deliveries-walmart/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKyGRXJ3oyzyt_0DdxHTHOKlb5chhKa9NRVH7ZjJ7d-auWT9GJY5teySjUb-M-OWUn7s0L4yEcA8F9dqx-2gyDxnj_HCDtPKvCAzEHCWY1A3kY0x5QBNxL5Is9qRXtzStWL-tnr0kbSfkJ6SdcGOfcaSELvGIvIb0pICcMQtipBg).

That's great, but what's new from the famously quiet CEO who once said this?:

[\\""Big News or No News\\"" TTT](https://preview.redd.it/42h2bmznq9081.jpg?width=320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3edaef28c9924eee85cdf52d7d72bbe9e97f6fbd)

What's new is that TTT has had ties to the famous Charles Koch, CEO of Koch Industries:

[TTT fangirling over Charles for nearly 2 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/i0wbugcpr9081.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc401c2c39815a7d86e9bff670e436e00ae05c0e)

[Check out this colorful Koch](https://preview.redd.it/fb9u5x72s9081.jpg?width=315&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e37277ef96f1f803e38374fa7f56279460f054b)

[MMM, tasty nuggets these tweets are](https://preview.redd.it/uuysax07s9081.jpg?width=305&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9bd31fd6060cda24a262dfc3ef7cad87db3f146)

So what? This doesn't mean TTT has any ""in"" with Charles Koch. To that, I'll let Tony Tequila's dog reply:

[\\""Eat shit like I do.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/wkuobfpls9081.jpg?width=320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf2885655d6bfe00d7138da54b511258a17c38d)

But seriously, this matters because Gatik was recently [funded](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/31/2289058/0/en/Gatik-Raises-85-Million-in-Series-B-Funding-Led-by-Koch-Disruptive-Technologies-KDT-to-Scale-Its-Fleet-of-Autonomous-Box-Trucks-Across-North-America.html) by Koch Disruptive Technologies (KDT).  You don't even need to guess who is involved in that or else I'll sic Gaius Aquila on you again.

But really, what is TTT's deal here?  Why be so secretive?  Well, this isn't his first rodeo and he's done this before:

[Feel Tony's power](https://preview.redd.it/366z4qolt9081.jpg?width=320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=577ccc593f989d0ffc9e86de42d3859adeea754e)

I'll save the remainder of the conjecture and hypothesizing to you all, but here are *some* of my positions on Canoo to appease your mortal desires to live vicariously through others:

[Easy $250k+ very soon](https://preview.redd.it/82gjch3vt9081.png?width=1063&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8a985f1575aa265ebf663837dbd839f70c327e2)

Finally, I'll leave you with the wise words of none other than Tony himself:

11/12/2021 2:11pm EST
By Stavros Georgiadis, CFA, InvestorPlace Contributor
It was recently announced that Swedish electric car maker Polestar Performance AB will be going public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Gores Guggenheim (NASDAQ:GGPI). The new company will be renamed Polestar Automotive Holding UK and is to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol PSNY. Right now, GGPI stock is pretty close to its original SPAC price, opening at $11.31 on Nov. 12.

The deal, which has an enterprise value of about $20 billion, might leave some investors indifferent. After all, EV makers going public via SPACs is nothing new. However, GGPI stock is worth monitoring due to some important factors. In the past Ive made it clear that I do not like SPACs. Theyre risky fueled by excitement rather than intrinsic value.

This SPAC has a lot of potential, though. And the stock price isnt too far off from its listing price.





A Long History of Success

The Gores Group is an investment company with more than 30 years of experience, more than $4 billion invested and more than 120 acquisitions.

Polestar is a Swedish electric car maker that was founded in 1996. It got its start developing performance hardware and software for racing vehicles with Volvo.

Volvo Cars is a Swedish automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles founded in 1927. It is an automaker synonymous with safety.

The combination of an experienced investment firm with a racing company backed by the know-how of a top reputable premium automaker makes GGPI stock an investment opportunity worth monitoring.

Why Im Excited About GGPI Stock

Alec Gores, the founder of The Gores Group, has stated that SPACs are great, as long not being abused. He has this to say:

I believe the SPAC product is a great product as long as its not being abused. So as a sponsor, you have to be very, very responsible. You have to know what youre doing. You also have to bring in great companies. So a great sponsor meet great companies makes a good SPAC and a great SPAC.
He also discussed why he sees Polestar as a great opportunity:

We literally see so many deals. The first thing is we vet things out quickly. Then we have a lot of conversations around things we find. The art is to start with a great company with the potential to be the leader in the space. Then you go to the management team, then to the product, a great product, and revenues, projections all of these things have to meet. Most important we have to be aligned with the management team. In this case Thomas [Ingenlath, Polestar CEO] and their team is incredible. Also having the Volvo relationship helps here.
Polestar is designing premium, high-performance electric vehicles, and thats exciting. But what I like most are the backing of The Gores Group. I also like these key highlights from Polestars Investor Presentation:

Polestar has two models now in production, Polestar 1 and Polestar 2, with plans to launch 3 new cars by the year 2024
Polestar considers itself to be the only global EV pure-play alongside Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)
Premium/luxury EVs are the fastest-growing segments of the global car market
Sales are expected to rise from 29,000 cars in 2021 to 290,000 cars in 2025
Expected revenue for 2021 is $1.6 billion and is forecasted to increase to $17.8 billion by the year 2025
By the year 2025, EBIT margin is expected to be 9%
EBIT break-even is expected in 2023
If this EBIT break-even occurs in 2023, that will be very good for Polestar. Im optimistic, because  in contrast with other SPACs that have brought EV automakers public based on plans alone  Polestar has already two models under production.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwdgh9/gores_guggenheim/

Polestar's Latest Development
Will Get Tesla's Attention
MAY 11. 2021 / BY JAY TRAUGOTT IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES &gt;
/ 17 COMMENTS
The entire auto industry should honestly take
note.
Polestar is showing no signs of slowing down
despite having only one battery-electric model
on sale. The Polestar 2 is now in dealerships
and, in the near future, the production version
of the gorgeous Precept concept will debut.
But there's another key area where Polestar is
shining brightly: sustainability. Last month, the
Swedish carmaker announced it will build the
world's first climate-neutral car by 2030.
Currently called Polestar 0, the company
wants to completely change the way future
vehicles are made. And now it's expanding its
partnership with blockchain provider Circulor

Is Polestar the Next Tesla? What to Know About the EV Maker as Polestar Stock Heats Up.
11/15/2021 10:55am EST
By Samuel O'Brient, InvestorPlace Financial News Writer


The year may be winding down, but the season of electric vehicles is still heating up. And from the looks of it, the race is only just starting. Last week, everyone was focused on newly public player Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), which set records in its debut. This week, were seeing markets prepare for another important debut as European innovator Polestar prepares to come public through a SPAC merger. Its partner Gores Guggenheim (NASDAQ:) is off to a good start this week, with Polestar stock up 16%.

Whats Happening With GGPI Stock

Today brought good news for anyone interested in the next big EV play. Polestar reported a positive update on its plans for the merger, specifically that the deal is expected to close within the first half of 2022.

After soaring more than 13% in pre-market trading, GGPI shares remain solidly positive. Were only an hour into the trading day, but shares are not showing signs of slowing down.





Polestar stocks morning has sent it up by nearly 38% for the past five days.

Why It Matters

As of now, it seems that all systems are go for the merger that will allow Polestar to start trading on the Nasdaq. When it does, the companys valuation will likely be around $20 billion. Besides Rivians stand-out debut, many investors are also likely thinking of innovator Lucid Motors (NASDASQ:LCID). LCID stock captivated investors with its own SPAC merger, and has enjoyed a strong 2021. Shares are up more than 80% in just the last month.

Polestar, though, has drawn more comparisons to industry giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). One expert described the companys Polestar 2 as the closest thing on the market today to a Tesla Model 3 competitor. While CEO Thomas Ingenlath has stated that his company does not intend to be the Tesla killer, its clear that the new player to the EV race could certainly challenge it. Polestar has plenty of projects in the works, including an SUV with a lidar advanced sensor system pioneered by Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR).

InvestorPlace contributor Stavros Georgiadis recently laid out the many reasons for investors to be excited about Polestar going public. He also noted that while many other SPAC deals have brought EV producers public before any actual vehicles had been released, Polestar has two models under production.

According to the statement released today, Polestar is ready for further growth. More specifically, the company is looking to sell 290,000 vehicles before the end of 2025. It is also planning to enter new international markets and expand its retail presence.

What It Means

According to Georgiadis, Polestar is a rare company in the sense that it is a EV SPAC play that isnt all talk. That certainly seems to be true.

There was plenty to be optimistic about this fall when the merger was first announced, and months later, theres even more cause to watch as the closing of the deal nears. For now, Polestar should be on everyones radar.

As some may have seen the last couple weeks PayPal's stock price has been on a down trend since the announcement of the Amazon partnership with Venmo (which PayPal owns). This will come into effect in early 2022. I really don't see too much of a downside to this, Venmo has been supporting cryptocurrencies just this year and I see this as a direct line for amazon purchases to be paid via cryptocurrency. And if we keep seeing adoption rates rising then this could be a huge play for PayPal to hold the advantage over Affirm and other payment platforms.

Okay, Q3 Earnings.

For this quarter, we see an income increase of only 6% over Q2, 1.02b to 1.08 b. Net revenue increase of 13%, $5.4b to $6.2b, long term debt is down roughly $1 billion as well from Dec 2020. Total Liabilities was up 2b, mostly in accrued expenses and funds payable to customers. As a whole, PayPal's debt came to $52 billion, and with annual revenue at $21.4b this is a tad concerning. Free cash flow increased 19%, and this year PayPal also increased spending in marketing and technology/development while decreasing spending for administration, so take this as you will.

Net new active accounts has fallen since last year by 12%. But, total payment volume since last year rose from $247b to $310b Number of payment transactions has also increased by about the same value (4%), but I see this increasing in Q1-Q2 of next year with Venmo partnering with Amazon. So as a whole there is strong customer engagement and a growing balance sheet.

Now, future outlook.

Paidy, a Japanese two sided buy-now, pay-later platform closed in October, so PayPal is looking to expand in Japan. This is big as Japans e-commerce is third ranking in the world. Along with this PayPal looks to develop more in app purchasing and expansion in various cryptocurrencies.

Recently there has been a lot of stirring in the news about PayPal needing to take a defensive stance against companies like Shopify, Affirm, and other BNPL services. On top of this Bernstein analysts downgraded their stock from a ""buy"" to ""hold"". The headlines defiantly resonated poorly with stock price, now down roughly 4%.

Concluding this little deep dive I find it hard to believe that PayPal will be a roll over in the next two to three years, as they are one of a few market leaders in their sector. In my opinion the nose dive in stock price is somewhat of a knee jerk reaction, and PayPal is now in a nice place to buy in.

I'm also curious where everyone's opinion is regarding PayPal.

Thanks for Reading.

# THE BIG RUMOR

See Trump is obviosuly trying to branch into the media space. I highly doubt Trump actually runs again, this motherfucker is going to make so much money regardless. Heres the rumor going around.

"" I spend a lot of time in Palm Beach, and  there is a rumor going around that this [\#spac](https://twitter.com/hashtag/spac?src=hashtag_click) is taking [@newsmax](https://twitter.com/newsmax) and some other right wing news entity public. [\#Trump](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump?src=hashtag_click) is building out a media empire that the right is going to have significant control over.  [\#trump](https://twitter.com/hashtag/trump?src=hashtag_click) was seen at [@Braves](https://twitter.com/Braves) game which is owned by the people who run [$lmaca](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24lmaca&amp;src=cashtag_click) and they're all big supporters of [\#trump](https://twitter.com/hashtag/trump?src=hashtag_click).  the volume on commons has spiked a few times in the last month on the commons and the warrants have steadily climbed towards now about $2.  this will be  like a mini [$dwac](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24dwac&amp;src=cashtag_click) 2.0 type thing if these rumors turn out to be true. all the pieces are there.Right now the commons are about $10.xx which represents about a 3% downside risk. additionally the short interest was 55% is now less than 36%. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah uh....thats it. I know right, peak WSB here gambling. A single twitter thread. Granted you can verify that Trump is talking to these officals. Its pretty easy to find the video of that.

The year may be winding down, but the season of electric vehicles is still heating up. And from the looks of it, the race is only just starting. Last week, everyone was focused on newly public player Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), which set records in its debut. This week, were seeing markets prepare for another important debut as European innovator Polestar prepares to come public through a SPAC merger. Its partner Gores Guggenheim (NASDAQ:GGPI) is off to a good start this week, with GGPI stock up 16%.

Whats Happening With GGPI Stock

Today brought good news for anyone interested in the next big EV play. Polestar reported a positive update on its plans for the merger, specifically that the deal is expected to close within the first half of 2022.

After soaring more than 13% in pre-market trading, GGPI shares remain solidly positive. Were only an hour into the trading day, but shares are not showing signs of slowing down.





GGPI stocks morning has sent it up by nearly 38% for the past five days.

Why It Matters

As of now, it seems that all systems are go for the merger that will allow Polestar to start trading on the Nasdaq. When it does, the companys valuation will likely be around $20 billion. Besides Rivians stand-out debut, many investors are also likely thinking of innovator Lucid Motors (NASDASQ:LCID). LCID stock captivated investors with its own SPAC merger, and has enjoyed a strong 2021. Shares are up more than 80% in just the last month.

Polestar, though, has drawn more comparisons to industry giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). One expert described the companys Polestar 2 as the closest thing on the market today to a Tesla Model 3 competitor. While CEO Thomas Ingenlath has stated that his company does not intend to be the Tesla killer, its clear that the new player to the EV race could certainly challenge it. Polestar has plenty of projects in the works, including an SUV with a lidar advanced sensor system pioneered by Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR).

InvestorPlace contributor Stavros Georgiadis recently laid out the many reasons for investors to be excited about Polestar going public. He also noted that while many other SPAC deals have brought EV producers public before any actual vehicles had been released, Polestar has two models under production.

According to the statement released today, Polestar is ready for further growth. More specifically, the company is looking to sell 290,000 vehicles before the end of 2025. It is also planning to enter new international markets and expand its retail presence.

What It Means

According to Georgiadis, Polestar is a rare company in the sense that it is a EV SPAC play that isnt all talk. That certainly seems to be true.

There was plenty to be optimistic about this fall when the merger was first announced, and months later, theres even more cause to watch as the closing of the deal nears. For now, GGPI should be on everyones radar.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks slumped on fears that rising inflation may jeopardize the global economic recovery, prompting central banks to raise interest rates sooner than expected. treasuries rose.
* Traders took some risk off the table as data revealed a slowdown in new home development in the United States, implying that builders are struggling to break ground on projects due to high material prices and continued labour shortages. Target Corp. fell after warning that cost pressures are increasing, fueling fears that inflation may eat into retailer profitability. The NASDAQ 100, which is heavy on technology, beat key indexes, spurred by a rally in tech titans Apple and Tesla.
* According to GS' CEO Solomon markets may face a rough period as the economy attempts to recover from the rapid impact of the epidemic. If interest rates rise, it will ""take some of the euphorias out of some markets,"" he said in an interview at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore.
* The worst quarter for the S&amp;P 500 since the pandemic appears to have scared off some do-it-yourself investors. According to the SEC and market data compiled by major newswire Intelligence, the retail trading surge that began with lockdowns has now subsided, with total equity volume from individual investors falling to 19% in the third quarter, down from 24% at the start of the year.

9:45 AM ET 11/10/21 | BusinessWire

Continuous monitoring device with advanced features and analytics to deliver personalized insights directly to the smartphone 
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 10, 2021-- 

Biotricity, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTCY), a modern medical technology company focused on delivering innovative, remote biometric monitoring solutions, today announced the availability of Bioheart, a direct-to-consumer heart monitor that offers the same continuous heart monitoring technology used by physicians. Showcased in prototype form at CES 2020, Bioheart has shipped to preorder customers and is now available for purchase at www.bioheart.com. 

The launch of Bioheart opens a new market and revenue stream for Biotricity while expanding the company's total addressable market by $1.24B, the global heart rate monitoring market. ""Launching Bioheart and expanding into this new market is an important step for Biotricity and our ultimate goal of building a complete cardiac ecosystem to service individuals throughout their heart health journey,"" said Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq, Founder and CEO of Biotricity. 

Heart conditions are intermittent, requiring long term data collection for effective insights. With continuous monitoring, Bioheart reinvents personal heart management with retrospective snapshots. Introducing a groundbreaking new capability, users can create snapshots of rhythm data by reviewing past data and marking it for personal records. This is a first-of-its-kind feature that will help individuals look back at their data for a richer understanding of their lifestyle impact and heart health. 
 
Bioheart features include:               With the Bioheart smartphone app, 
                                         users can:

                                         heart data with a physician 
 

Bioheart incorporates the Company's proprietary advanced heart technology, combined with powerful analytics and continuous rhythm monitoring, to help individuals understand and improve their heart health. It provides 24/7 electrical heart rhythm monitoring and recording with three different views of the heart, which can be streamed live on the Bioheart smartphone app. Bioheart is the most accurate heart monitor available without a prescription. 

""Bioheart combines unparalleled accuracy in a heart monitoring device with continuous data, advanced heart health insights, and powerful features tailored to individuals at risk for heart disease or who want precise data for performance tracking, optimization and preventative cardiac wellness,"" said Dr. Al-Siddiq. ""Bioheart furthers Biotricity's mission of developing revolutionary healthcare solutions that help engage and empower individuals to take control of their health, starting with the deadliest chronic disease and one of healthcare's largest cost drivers: cardiac disease."" 

Heart condition signs are typically intermittent, and most heart monitoring devices only capture short periods of heart activity. These devices have limited capabilities and do not provide individuals with the heart data or tools needed to support preventative care and effective lifestyle improvements. With Bioheart's continuous monitoring and long-term data collection approach, users can analyze heart data from previous months, well after the initial recording, to understand changes and long-term trends. 

""Bioheart has the potential to make an immediate, life-changing impact for those who use it,"" added Dr. Al-Siddiq. ""As a direct manufacturer, we're thrilled to have been able to accelerate our market delivery to the general market in less than a year, ahead of schedule and in time for the busy holiday gifting season."" 

Bioheart retails for $199 and is available for purchase here or at www.bioheart.com. The app is available on Apple's App Store and on Google Play.

I want to start this with a brief message about myself for those of you that don't follow me.

There is a lot of FUD about me that I would like to dismiss.

I think this is an important step so that my work and the work of many others who have helped me along the way. Is not judged on my personality or profession, but by it's quality and adherence to supporting evidence.

Many of you were likely unaware of my existence or never gave me a glance due to the fact that I did Technical Analysis on a ""highly manipulated"" stock.

So here is my GME story,

Exactly one year ago, to the day, I entered my first position on GME. It was November 17th,2020 and GME opened at $11.5, after following DFV's posts for a few weeks I decided that his analysis was solid (far better than anything else I had read on that sub in my couple years lurking there), Bought in Feb.19th 20c and 500 shares. I will never forget inputting those orders, it changed my life and many of you probably have that same memory.

I began at first to comment and then get more involved with community as a whole I liked watching the streams but found them to be disingenuous, I never felt that AMC was the play and I still don't. So I settled on warden, he was obviously inexperienced at TA and didn't have a lot of market knowledge, but it was cool to have a place to hang out and talk my favorite stock.

When warden announced he was leaving to handle personal matters I decided that I didn't want the daily posts to end. I thought they helped people hodl and provided a calm grounded narrative of what the stock was doing everyday. With a lot of people returning to work I considered this valuable and tried my hand at it. As it grew keeping up with the barrage of questions became daunting so as per many daily followers request I started a YT stream.

It was fun and small I got to answer questions and help apes better understand the markets, we had fun. many of the people that were with me those first few weeks are still around today.

I never did it to make money, GME had already assured that wouldn't be an issue. But, I had to eventually face the fact that there was a real cost to the time I took away from my job trading, and with most of my holdings still in GME I decided to monetize my stream. The support from the people that choose to support me has been invaluable and also allowed me the time to dig deeper and deeper into GME over the last several months. I promised myself that I would never withhold information behind a paywall and that no ape would ever have to become a member to ask me a question. I've kept that promise.

Then warden blew up his audience on the back of a pretty speculative DD and I got lumped in with the ""youtubers are evil"" sentiment, which honestly I understand, the vast majority of them are big fucking shills. Regardless of what I had done or service provided, I was so labeled. I've learned to live with it.

But I've continued plugging away over these last 7-months missing 1 stream, 2 Daily DD posts, and 3 weekly DDs as I was moving. I've flown mostly under the radar most people didn't like my opinions and I didn't want to confirm anybody's bias. The speculative stuff is fine it's fun to talk about but it's not my cup of tea.

What I did do was try to leverage my newfound role as an ""influencer"" and I selected from the people interested in my work, the best and brightest I could and built a team to dig into GME's many mysteries. We have succeed and we have failed, but from our failures we learned and pushed forward.

This DD is the culmination of our efforts. I think over the course of me releasing it, no matter your feelings towards me, that you would be doing your self a disservice by not reading it. I strongly believe this thesis presents the most realistic and evidence based view of the market mechanics that drive GME price action and is the best, to date, predictor of it's potential in the future.

As always I hodl with all of you,

\- gherkinit



So the plan for this DD is as follows:

* The events leading up to and causing the gamma ramp/volatility squeeze that occurred in January.
* Tie together the ETF, FTD, Options and Futures cyclical movement that drives GME price action
* Lay out my futures cycle theory and explain the price movements on GME to date
* Explain why January's run did not cause the expected short squeeze on GME
* Take a look forward, using the same unavoidable market mechanics, to determine where SHFs, MMs, and ETFs are most exposed.
* Present a case for retail to in fact be the catalyst for MOASS
* Discuss the how and why , this is possible.
* Dispel the misinformation regarding options and present multiple ways they can be used effectively by those with the requisite knowledge.

I will attempt to make an **evidence backed case** for each of my conclusions and try to tie all of this together in a way people can digest and understand.

# Part I: January 2021

In January of last year we witnessed the price of GME rocket 2700%, according to the SEC report written a few weeks ago this was not due to SHF covering and it was not due to a gamma squeeze as was previously thought.

Meaning that based on the SEC report, the price action witnessed in January was due almost entirely to retail buying and options hedging.

While a lot of that conclusion appears to be true from the data presented, January was not likely the result of WSB's largest pump n' dump.

Something else was going on behind the scenes something left out of the report...

The massive short interest not only on GME but the short interest on ETFs that contained GME.

The SEC report touches on this briefly but really limits it's explanation of what was going on, giving an example of XRT, but conveniently not the other 106 (currently) ETFs containing GME.

**So what actually happened?**

Well I guess the best place to start is Melvin Capital...

**Section 1: Melvin Capital**

As many of you know Melvin Capital, by their own admission, began their short position on GME in 2014. They built a massive short position over several years likely with the intention of driving GME out of business or deeply into debt.

[The bear case for GME was strong, Melvin's position is evidenced here in the weekly OBV for GME indicating strong selling pressure.](https://preview.redd.it/kbl01yyqk7081.png?width=2393&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9d5a0c5f7538bbfb24f20abb441876c3fc34e1f)

&amp;#x200B;

Until Michael Burry's purchase in 2019 Melvin was definitely winning the battle. This represented a integral change in the short positions on GME the renewed interest on the stock put a massive number of these short positions underwater.

In August of 2020 and December of 2020 RC Ventures made their purchases of GameStop's stock (catalyzing the cycles I will define later in this DD), further exacerbating the pressure on GME short positions.

# By the end of December 2020, the last three years of Melvin Capital's short position was negative 33% to 751%.

**Section 2: The Big Boys**

How did Citadel, Susquehanna, and Point 72, end up on the wrong side of retail?

We know of their involvement due to the bailout's offered by them to Robinhood and Melvin Capital in January. Bailouts likely designed to prevent margin calls on these much smaller positions which could have had catastrophic effects for Citadel's et al. margin.

Well if we take a look at the broader market during this time frame you will see significant short-interest in retail ETFs pick up after March of 2020. With Coronavirus mounting and no end to the pandemic in sight, there was a strong bear case against traditional retail.

With companies like Amazon realizing all time highs e-commerce was looking better and better. It's not hard to see the justification these guys are likely some of many that went short the entire sector. ETFs presented a great way to short the entire sector in one fell swoop. That combined with less stringent reporting requirements and near infinite ability to create shares, provided the ideal opportunity for the massive funds.

Go into any mall in America throw a rock and you will hit a company that these guys were short on.

AdamMelvinCitadel, BBBY, M, EXPR, JWN, DDS, etc... the list goes on and on

All these stocks move with GameStop because they were short the whole sector/index. They still are.

[XRT current short interest](https://preview.redd.it/oa0583f6l7081.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d0ff0eba1790b970d3fd3b6d244452e3eda4483)

&amp;#x200B;

We can still see evidence of this ETF exposure play out on the charts as well

[Some ETF basket stocks mimicking GME price action](https://preview.redd.it/qmmhonxal7081.png?width=2203&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff00885ec65aab0c4f6b3389c3e7124415918845)

&amp;#x200B;

**Section 3: The Clash of the Titans**

Moving into January GameStop price is improving exponentially. Putting pressure on existing short positions.

From August low to December high it is now up 405.37%

This price increase in the underlying starts to breed FOMO we see retail buying in at ever increasing numbers stock.

https://preview.redd.it/oktvytodl7081.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d34134ac972b0ddf49f7c3faacddce21ffd60f

and options...

This push combined with delta hedging led to the price increasing another 2400% over the rest of the month.

But on January 29th it all comes crashing down...

But it can't be that simple it wasn't purely FOMO as the SEC would have you believe.

January's price action was kicked off by a series of events that almost a year later we have a much better grasp of.

# Part 2: Cyclical Market Mechanics

Underlying all of GME's price movement to date are several independent cycles that I have identified over the last few months.

I've outlined these a bunch of times on my stream, but I want to get the information all in one place.

**Section 1:** **Futures Roll Dates**

First lets start with the first one I noticed that led me down this rabbit hole.

CME Futures Roll dates strongly corresponded to GME price action So let's look at those.

[This was the first significant indicator of price action on GME. These became very apparent after the July run into earnings and subsequent drop.](https://preview.redd.it/ew8oeb5wl7081.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ff4a13c7e8e9caffd9989d4a33bba835c391ffb)

Once we stared digging back into previous rolls we realized that there were two variations.

**1.** **The Roll:**

This is marked by an increase of volume and price into the roll date, followed by a drop immediately afterwards. (Feb-Mar and Jun - Jul)

**2. The Fail:**

This is marked by a sharp spike in volume several days prior to the roll date then a decline in volume and volatility until a window of activity appears (anomaly) T+35 days after the roll date. **(t**hese T+35 dates also lined up with spikes in SEC FTD reports)

[Fails create anomalies, Rolls do not](https://preview.redd.it/l54rzxkyl7081.png?width=2395&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42776ea0ec496f5cc89842717063f9826cbdf1ac)

With these data points locked down the next logical place to look was what was causing these initial spikes.

We currently know of two separate futures position exposure on GME

* Variance Swaps as described by [u/Zinko83](https://www.reddit.com/u/Zinko83/) in this excellent DD, Volatility, Variance, Dispersion, Oh my! (must got to profile as it cannot be linked here)
* Swaps used to hedge NAV or exposure on creation baskets in ETFs. More on ETF here in [u/Turdfurg23](https://www.reddit.com/u/Turdfurg23/)'s DD The ETF Money Tree (same deal cause auto-mod)

https://preview.redd.it/6good1c0m7081.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3b3aebb2e3b248de17d27a3b1ec5dcff31fbc09

**Section 2: ETF Exposure**

We were fairly confident at this point in our research that ETFs represented a significant part of the short exposure on GME.

The ease of share creation by Authorized Participants and the exceptionally long settlement periods afforded to them, made ETFs the perfect way to not only continually suppress the price but also a great place to hide longer term short exposure, without the reporting requirements of traditional bona-fide market making.

[This process is covered exceptionally in this paper by Richard B. Evans](https://jacobslevycenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ETF-Short-Interest-and-Failures-to-Deliver.pdf)

[and this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncq35zrFCAg)

So where was this exposure we knew that somewhere in these overlapping cycles we were gonna find it and we did.

[These options dates that line up perfectly with OpEx, ETF Quarterly Options and GME Monthly Expiration](https://preview.redd.it/7232oxv1m7081.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68f6c59f529819200a50867cef267197e62ecdf2)

But it didn't fit until we factor in gamma exposure (GEX) from market makers on T+2/3

Then we start to see a very strong correlation with GME initial pump on these runs and overlapping gamma exposure. Starting after RC's initial buy in, with the magnitude increasing exponentially after his second purchase in December.

https://preview.redd.it/byp0yb65m7081.png?width=2394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4045730412bd9e34101320c223acdb6dd38b7669

These exposure dates have kickstarted the price increases on GME in the last 5 out of 5 futures cycles

**So a quick break here to recap...**

We know ETF Exposure kickstarts these cycles and that they either roll the futures (causing a run as the cover losses before rolling contracts forward) or fail to roll the contracts (causing FTD pile-ups in the anomaly window)

So this left us asking **why January**?

We had the obvious answer already, the SEC claimed that retail single handedly pulled off one of the largest pump and dumps in history with zero collusion...but did Daddy Gensler tell us the truth?

Something had to be different about January's cycle specifically

Then we stumbled across this little tidbit that had been staring us in the face for months.

[ETF and Equity Leaps expire not once, but two times in the Dec-Jan Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/ta8kpk57m7081.png?width=162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d0924770e8fc9fd744e4ddcda8c1eb52e09d185)

LEAPS for those of you that are unaware present a far higher amount of gamma exposure than quarterlies.

[This is largely due to institutional interest in longer dated options contracts](https://preview.redd.it/6ppjrrv8m7081.png?width=1588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d2875ed1ea8d4003f9d1147b6a292fd85448da8)

So let's look at these LEAP exposure dates in relation to the rest of our cycle

[The price action and volume from Dec-Jan on these dates speaks for itself but June is the most impressive to me because in a sea of red from the ATM share offering and GME ETF rebalancing resulting in 12m+ shares sold at market, even all that liquidity wasn't enough to suppress the price, the expiration and the following t+2 days were still up.](https://preview.redd.it/78kuq9o9m7081.png?width=2393&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdf9d7e2862d213d79921bbff01e577a91f17870)

**Section 3: The FTD pileup**

This is the last bit of what ties all this together.

Since the futures fail patterns have a unique outcome that causes this anomaly window what exactly drives that anomaly in the areas in between the ETF exposure dates and the the subsequent futures roll.

The answer is FTDs

Now there are 2 types of FTDs

1. **MM and SHF FTDs** \- Most people know this on by now but just in case

*T+2/3 trading days (locate) + 35 calendar days (REG T)*

2. **ETF Authorized Participant (AP)** \-

Authorized participants have a bit more flexibility and thus there failures can occur outside of the standard timeline.

[So AP's have T+3 trading days \(locate\) &amp; T+6 trading days \(settlement\) + 35 calendar days \(REG T\)](https://preview.redd.it/91xt7uvdm7081.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79821b78e1be0ce9ec3f6899582e9fba95d3cf99)

In the past you have heard a lot about T+35 and T+21 and this predicted cycles have failed to come to fruition because the anchor points for where the settlement periods end (t+2/t+6) and where the fail must be satisfied (t+35) were misplaced.

Everyday is T+35 from another day, so having these ETF exposure dates and CME Roll and Expiration dates gave us insight into where MMs and APs had to do the most hedging and also where there was the most gamma exposure or deviation from NAV (net asset value, ETF hedging metric).

With these anchor point locked down we started to be able to build out a t+35 timeline

[The light-blue vertical lines represent GME FTD Regulation T dates set from the point of failure](https://preview.redd.it/s68o5u3gm7081.png?width=2462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a199e82241d638879780c16ef870092cbd4e2c0f)

and since there are still a couple days around these periods with unexplained movement, such as November 3rd, where we were sideswiped by completely unexpected price action.

This is due to something we had never initially tracked ETF FTDs, throughout the year FTDs on GME containing ETFs had been fairly minimal with a few spikes here and there. So we sidelined the information and focused on GME.

Well something interesting happened on September 21st., that got attention immediately.

[GME Containing ETFs Spiked with the largest numbers of FTDs to Date](https://preview.redd.it/3vjhvhzhm7081.png?width=1947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c3456c59090520b510366bfc5d87c84a9075ef6)

Well guess what happened T+6 (trading) and 35 calendar days after that futures failure, like clockwork on November 3rd...

[The final piece of the puzzle](https://preview.redd.it/6yw66qmim7081.png?width=2454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3da195101ba78db6dedaabf198b4bfee0e37eb8)

So this at this point we are still unsure if this also occurred in other cycles, the only other large ETF FTD spikes we have this year are far smaller quantity. So now we have to go back and look at the previous cycles.

* For the cycles that fail to roll futures the largest exposure date is the CME rollover(red line)
* For cycles were they roll the greatest amount of exposure is on the first FTD date (blue line)

[Historical ETF FTD dates](https://preview.redd.it/6t17eyilm7081.png?width=2453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6927f66f5768865b93f355ba58f6b5be3f057ec)

**Section 4: January IS absolutely unique!**

Remember those LEAPS we talked about earlier?

One day a year in January the highest amount of open interest and thus gamma exposure in the options chain occurs...

# GME LEAPS and ETF LEAPS expire simultaneously

this moment indicates the largest amount of exposure across the entire year on GME, and and also presents the highest probability for a short squeeze (more on this later)

Without further ado...

[Full futures Cycle breakdown from Sep 2020 to today](https://preview.redd.it/r069ht2nm7081.png?width=2368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a85375269c1c6ecd3d5cb399fd4bdd1eb4bbe86)

Here is the final guide to GME price action and the summation of this part of the thesis

These dates and windows (futures) track almost every single move on GME since September of 2020. If it didn't happen on one of these dates/windows then it happened within their respective settlement periods (T+2/3)

and for the smoother readers...

""Bioheart combines unparalleled accuracy in a heart monitoring device with continuous data, advanced heart health insights, and powerful features tailored to individuals at risk for heart disease or who want precise data for performance tracking, optimization and preventative cardiac wellness,"" said Dr. Al-Siddiq. ""Bioheart furthers Biotricity's mission of developing revolutionary healthcare solutions that help engage and empower individuals to take control of their health, starting with the deadliest chronic disease and one of healthcare's largest cost drivers: cardiac disease."" 

Heart condition signs are typically intermittent, and most heart monitoring devices only capture short periods of heart activity. These devices have limited capabilities and do not provide individuals with the heart data or tools needed to support preventative care and effective lifestyle improvements. With Bioheart's continuous monitoring and long-term data collection approach, users can analyze heart data from previous months, well after the initial recording, to understand changes and long-term trends. 

""Bioheart has the potential to make an immediate, life-changing impact for those who use it,"" added Dr. Al-Siddiq. ""As a direct manufacturer, we're thrilled to have been able to accelerate our market delivery to the general market in less than a year, ahead of schedule and in time for the busy holiday gifting season."" 

Bioheart retails for $199 and is available for purchase here or at www.bioheart.com. The app is available on Apple's App Store and on Google Play.

I am expecting about a 20k (appx) tax bill for this year, due to some good fortune really. 

In January I won just over 60k in an online poker tournament. I am not a pro player and this was a big deal for me, I just play here and there, happened to do really well one day. I paid off some debt, put some in savings. I took 20k of it in anticipation of the taxes and set it aside. I still have that.  

Being a long time investor in market I decided I wanted to make the money work for me while I had it. Put into fairly safe positions and sold covered calls throughout year. At this point I am looking at about 9k in premium income through the year from those covered call sales (more money in account than just this 20k). Plus some capital gains too.

Wife and I file joint and pull in about $140,000 a year, with this extra income Im looking at the 24% tax bracket. With about $70,000 in income that hadnt been taxed yet between poker winnings and income from market gains and call premiums. 

Im thinking about selling off some down positions before end of year. Probably shaving off about 12k from overall income, thinking that could save me maybe 3k or so on taxes.

Some background

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are a way for Chinese stocks to circumvent laws to get their company listed on foreign exchanges. Theres a lot of plausible issues that stem from this practice where the Chinese company can create false financials to make their company look healthy and Evergrandes problems fuels this fear. However, a trump era proposition known as [Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-53) will audit Chinese companies and have American SEC representatives of the [Public Company Accountability Oversight Board](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-2021-07-30) shadow them or face being delisted.

Furthermore, the Chinese Crackdown has resulted in billions in fines to major companies all throughout the provinces and is just some extra fearmongering about why you shouldnt buy these stocks. The 2008 crisis in America was handled like shit and could have easily been prevented if government entities did what China is doing right now, checking the books of the filthy rich and not letting them falsify their data. This past year news outlets have been fearmongering retail investors out of all Chinese stocks just like they did during the first GME uptick.

The future

These policies in place, both American and Chinese, will make the Chinese tickers that remain listed much stronger. Stocks like Alibaba, and JD are competitors for largest companies in the world that are even looking at African and South American countries for growth. Alibaba has over a billion active users compared to Amazons 300 million. Its not just a store, its a mall, mobile service provider, data cloud, video streaming service, and a bank. [Jack Ma is as capitalist as it gets](https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/the-speech-that-cost-jack-ma-37-billion-dollars-5ad42393c9ba), and he is plenty against regulation and displays progressive thinking which put him into the shadows, but I guarantee you his [legacy](https://interconnected.blog/jack-ma-bund-finance-summit-speech/) will have an impact.

The lack of interest in the second largest economy in the world while China and America begin improving diplomatic relations is stupid. Either do your own TA or realize some Chinese companies made more on singles day than most American companies have in annual revenue.

1,"11/18/2021, 05:59:47",Amazon: a Random Walk Simulation,v202099,"I developed a Monte Carlo Simulation for stocks analysis in python, and have some very interesting results.

This algorithm calculates (the probability of) potential movements for a specific assets, using a random walk approach.

For inputs I used the standard deviation of logarithmic returns based on historical price data at close, and charted the possibilities.

To explain the usefulness you need to take a look at what a random walk is, and basically by repeating a random movement within certain parameters over a large enough number of intervals you can detect (probabilities of ) a pattern within.

Here are the results for Amazon (""AMZN""), as seen over a spawn of 100 days:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wof98gtf88081.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e895b01a7bfd57644fd13242291a2f24f7d0d5a3

As you can see, nothing that amazing can be learned from this chart, as it looks like it could go either up or down, completely randomly.

Here a quick explanation for the smooth brained among you: Each line is a potential outcome for the next 100 days. There are 1000 lines - which means a coin is tossed every day, for 100 days, (with a slightly skewed outcome based on historical events), and the result of what the coin toss says is marked on the chart.

Now take a look at the next graphic with a much larger time span, and 100x the iterations:

[It took my PC about 5 minutes to calculate this.](https://preview.redd.it/2fcbgspi88081.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a02e23ed7f2998ce142a49fbb174e789f1843e76)

Here you can clearly see that it WILL go up, and the probability of it going VERY high exists. In this chart there are 100,000 lines, over an interval of 1000 days.

With a price target between $2000 and $35,000, where it seems likely the price will hit around $10,000 within a few years. Remember, in any random walk the more times this random walk is carried out, the more a pattern becomes visible.

What do you think the possibility is of Amazon hitting a market cap of 16 Trillion ($35,000 price target) within 10 years? What do you think of monte carlo simulations and random walks in general?

Based on this, I will most likely go in on an AMZN Leap - $5000 by end of 2024 for sure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwa2u9/amazon_a_random_walk_simulation/

* Achieved record revenue and units sold levels in the third quarter; year-over-year growth of 200% and 100%, respectively
* Total Gross Profit of $13.0 million, an increase of 248% year-over-year
* Projecting 151% year-over-year Q4'2021 revenue growth, at the midpoint of management guidance range
* Management raises full-year revenue guidance to $621 million - $629 million, over 3x year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range

My take on HMC. HMC is one of the biggest automotive car companies. We have driven civic all my life and love the car, the drive and how it feels. The stock is getting any love. In Canada, civic has been the best selling car for 23 years. The valuation is less than $50B. Honda beat estimates this past quarter. 

*  Despite some unfavorable factors such as the supply shortage of certain parts including semiconductors and an increase in raw material costs, consolidated operating profit for the fiscal first half (6 months) ended September 30, 2021 amounted to 442.1 billion yen, a year-on-year increase by 272.9 billion yen compared to the same period last year which was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was due primarily to the positive effect of increased unit sales, cost reduction efforts and favorable currency effects.
* Consolidated profit for the first half (6 months) attributable to owners of the parent amounted to 389.2 billion yen, a year-on-year increase by 229.1 billion yen, due mainly to an increase in the share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method.

The management said their earnings might be affected because of supply chain issues. But I don't the result of cautious guidance should be price trading 40% lower than the book value.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9z2e/why_is_no_one_talking_about_sft_and_hmc/

You're lucky im in a good mood because I don't like writing DD for this sub anymore. Let me dodge all the Lazer beans and get this message out:

The digital currency that is gold and contains the name bit in it went through an upgrade recently called taproot. Square has been positioning itself for this upgrade for several years now and has recently performed some moves like the acquisition of tidal, small loan lending, and teenage banking. This will all come together.

Square is releasing a white paper on Nov 19 which will effectively outline the direction of Square 
 
I have written about Square before but expect Square to compete aggressively with common banks by offering insane amount of interest in their deposits.  The name of the game for them is to increase their deposits as a way to validate new services.

There are many examples of this being dot com 2.0. Large portions of it will be due to brrr policy since the pandemic, lingering quantitative easing from 2008 and rock bottom interest rates.

However in this time we have seen some incredible stuff from retail such as:
- a guy who held $PLTR since Dec 21 thinking it was a weed stock
- a person put 1/4 of their money in a banned ticker with the sum total of their DD being it had lithium in the name and was based in China and ""the Chinese know their stuff""
-all people that believes Tesla justifies their current value

I just want to know how much of this bubble we think is caused by us and how much is from the big boys.

1,"11/18/2021, 04:23:19",$SKYT Space chips to the moon ,adameepoo,"Skywater Technologies (SKYT) is the only US owned fab that's part of the DoD trusted fab program. They've missed significantly on their last two earnings and their stock's tanked each time. It has 23% short interest today. They're just shy of $1B but were over for the majority of the year so I hope this clears the microcap hurdle.

So why's this time different? Because their long term strategy can finally became clear on 11/8/21 when Bloomberg came out with an article about the $2 billion order the Pentagon needs to rush through because of the East Fishkill fab Global Foundries (GF) is transferring to On Semi at the end of 2022.

Huh?

**Here's how the timeline breaks down:**

In April 2019, GF sells Fishkill to ON Semi, set to transition throughout 2022

[https://gf.com/press-release/semiconductor-and-globalfoundries-partner-transfer-ownership-east-fishkill-ny-300mm](https://gf.com/press-release/semiconductor-and-globalfoundries-partner-transfer-ownership-east-fishkill-ny-300mm)

SKYT's CEO was a former GF exec and later that year announces securing $170MM in funding from the DoD ""to make chips that can work in outer space, and create smaller, faster ones with new materials"". 

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-skywater-defense/minnesota-chip-maker-gets-up-to-170-million-from-us-defense-dept-idUSKBN1X025E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-skywater-defense/minnesota-chip-maker-gets-up-to-170-million-from-us-defense-dept-idUSKBN1X025E)

About 6 months later, SKYT and GF announce a memorandum of agreement to ""align their technologies to give defense customers reliable access to high-volume manufacturing""

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors/semiconductor-manufacturers-reach-deal-to-supply-u-s-defense-chips-idUSKBN23P3BQ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors/semiconductor-manufacturers-reach-deal-to-supply-u-s-defense-chips-idUSKBN23P3BQ)

Within two months, two additional GF execs join SKYT, an EVT of technology and biz dev

And in July 2021, SKYT was ready to launch their 90 nm strategic rad-hard process platform

[https://militaryembedded.com/radar-ew/rugged-computing/skywater-successfully-launches-mpw-shuttle-for-90-nm-strategic-rad-hard-by-process-platform](https://militaryembedded.com/radar-ew/rugged-computing/skywater-successfully-launches-mpw-shuttle-for-90-nm-strategic-rad-hard-by-process-platform)

Now for the new Nov 8 revelation...

""In other instances, we are partnering with the DoD to extend the lifecycle of certain technologies manufactured at Fab 10 by transitioning the manufacturing of their chips to other GF Fabs""

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/pentagon-swoops-in-to-buy-last-of-kind-chips-for-b-2-destroyer](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/pentagon-swoops-in-to-buy-last-of-kind-chips-for-b-2-destroyer)

&amp;#x200B;

**What does East Fishkill build?**

The RAD510 SoCs are manufactured at GFs Fab 10 facility in East Fishkill, N.Y"" The RAD510 is a ""...radiation-hardened general purpose processor"" (i.e. rad-hard)

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005039/en/BAE-Systems-Collaborates-With-GLOBALFOUNDRIES-to-Produce-Radiation-Hardened-Single-Board-Computers-for-Space](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005039/en/BAE-Systems-Collaborates-With-GLOBALFOUNDRIES-to-Produce-Radiation-Hardened-Single-Board-Computers-for-Space)

&amp;#x200B;

**What we now know**

East Fishkill made rad-hard chips for the DoD that are used in space. ON Semi announced recently that they'll no longer support these product lines and the DoD is scrambling to find a replacement. GF knew this and started creating closer ties with a US-owned US-operated fab (for domestic politics presumably). GF doesn't have the capacity to move the Fishkill lines entirely to Malta (they were already operating at over 80% capacity before the chip shortage) so the ""other GF fabs"" will almost certainly be outsourced to SKYT as a sub. That gives everybody a win, gov can say their space chips are now US made and sourced, GF doesn't lose production and still reaps licensing fees from SKYT, and most of all SKYT gets some fat juicy gov contracts that GF has already sold.

&amp;#x200B;

**How fat? How juicy?**

These were some budgeting line items that the USAF released in May. That doesn't include all the other branches of gov, but I am expecting the growth rates to be similar in size.

Strategic Radiation Hardened Trusted Microelectronics Foundry: 23.4M in 2021 to $140MM in 2022 (+500% increase)

Oh, and that Advanced Packaging and Testing? SKYT just bought a fab in Florida that does just that!

[https://www.skywatertechnology.com/press-releases/skywater-expanding-with-florida-facility-to-accelerate-domestic-advanced-packaging-capabilities-for-microelectronics-manufacturing/](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/press-releases/skywater-expanding-with-florida-facility-to-accelerate-domestic-advanced-packaging-capabilities-for-microelectronics-manufacturing/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Thesis:**

SKYT is positioning themselves as a niche fab for extremely high value, high margin chips. They're caught in a transitioning period while they make these investments, and Wall Street HATES that they're not posting massive numbers like AMD or NVDA, but that's not their game. They're playing the long game for US space chips and are poised to take over production from the East Fishkill fab as On Semi takes over more and more over the next year.

Once that deal is announced, the stock will rally and rally hard. There's 2MM shares short today on a 8MM float. Last quarter when they tanked, they started making similar announcements within a month. I'm hoping the big one comes next, but it may not be until Q1.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:**

Just entered a small position today. IV is silly high right now, which made me go deep ITM. I'm hoping $22 is a strong support, but if it continues to go down, I'll buy more into it. Will plan to roll monthly until a deal is announced.

The  self-driving vehicle technology business finished the day at $9.60 a  share (Nasdaq:AUR), about 3% below where the blank check company it  merged with finished its last day of trading on Wednesday. That gave it a  market cap of about $12.5 billion, up from a valuation of about $10  billion it had after a venture round last December.

Aurora  is emerging from its combination with special purpose acquisition  company Reinvent Technology Partners Y (Nasdaq:RTPY) with about $1.8  billion in gross proceeds from the deal and cash on its books. That's  below the $2.5 billion that was projected, mostly due to the large  number of the SPAC's shares that were refunded before the merger closed.

The  company made Pittsburgh its headquarters several months ago, dropping  the dual headquarters setup it has been operating under in which  Mountain View was the other location. But two of its three founders   CEO [Chris Urmson](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/search/results?q=Chris%20Urmson) and President [Sterling Anderson](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/search/results?q=Sterling%20Anderson)  remain in Silicon Valley and say they have no plans to move.

Aurora  said it plans to use the infusion of new capital to further fund the  commercial launch of its Aurora Horizon and the Aurora Connect  self-driving subscription services for trucking carriers and  ride-hailing fleets, respectively.

Aurora  Horizon is expected to launch in 2023 and Aurora Connect is planned for  2024. Both will be powered by the Aurora Driver  the company's name  for its fully autonomous self-driving software and hardware capabilities  and the data services that come with it, which had its beta version  released last week.

""Today marks a  significant milestone for Aurora and the self-driving industry as we  revolutionize transportation  making it safer, increasingly accessible,  and more reliable and efficient than ever before,"" Urmson said in a  press release on Thursday

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to keep this short and simple. If you like free money, here is a proven life hack that prints. Buy $PLTR when it dips below $23 and sell when it gets above $26. It is the ultimate Kangaroo game that prints. **HINT: It is currently below $23**.

[TLDR: Buy when it touches the green line and sell when it touches the red line.](https://preview.redd.it/idka8orbn7081.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e9ab1c45add4a0fde7264038c478d07f19ec3b5)

**ABOUT PALANTIR ($PLTR)**

If you want to know about the company, go look that shit up. They do fancy analysis for people who pay them money. It doesn't matter. Do you know how a Kangaroo gets around?  That's what matters.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRADING STRATEGY**

Buy below $23 and sell above $26.

&amp;#x200B;

This is free money. You don't need to study anything or put in any work. Just collect the money. That's it.

If this is the case, why do you think so? Perhaps Market makers are looking to have a lower gamma risk? Or perhaps by raising the deltas across the board they raise premiums as well.

Bit Digital had $92 million in revenue in the last 12 months. It has tripled in price so far. And it is cheap, at 14 times trailing earnings and five times sales. Compare this to the other mining stocks and it is a steal, with a projected share price of $46.78 (4x upside potential based on that alone, without the short squeeze potential): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yj9a6LWLAIaKl-5oN0GPtN_1HlPRUNiF/edit#gid=1585989403

If digital currencies continues to rip upwards this year this stock will explode. It's currently heavily shorted by institutions which is suppressing the stock price. Its consistently among the most shorted stocks in the market https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest, currently at around ~31% of the float. 

We all saw what happened with $gme, $tlry, and $amc this year. Institutions got caught with their pants down and are now losing millions of dollars by naked shorting these highly volatile stocks.

Why?

* Surely that's not the intrinsic value, right?

* Or is this the natural line held by the bulls vs bears?

1,"11/18/2021, 03:15:14",Long-term value and a middle finger to Big pharma.,OoBeRStoNKs,"I believe that an epic opportunity is brewing and I hope that I can get through the admin to share my thoughts with you.

Since the pandemic started Big pharma has capitalized on the suffering of others and made tons of money. All the while shoving a brand new vaccine technology down our throats. All this business about mandates doesn't sit very well when we don't have access to all the options.

There is a little company out there who has developed vaccines based on a protein subunit approach with a novel manufacturing technique and a novel adjavant that seems to be highly efficacious. Novavax's (NVAX) matrix-m adjavant is made from saponin derived from the sap of a tree. It was also shown to be an excellent adjavant in a flu vaccine that has been through phase 3 clinical trials already and in an Oxford University joint trial malaria vaccine which achieved the highest efficacy ever seen in one of those. 

There are many other advantages to Novavax's approach and IT IS NOW APPROVED FOR EMERGENCY USE IN TWO COUNTRIES. A few searches online can find you a lot of the information but I will summarize some of the main points here.

1. only five micrograms of protein is injected making it one of the smallest dose vaccines and easier to make.

2. It does not require deep cold storage and has longer shelf life making the logistics much easier for distribution.

3. It is a traditional protein subunit vaccine that can help address vaccine hesitancy and end the pandemic globally.

4. Novavax has the global capacity to manufacture over 2 billion doses per year.

Until the development of the covid vaccine and the pandemic Novavax was a distressed company and they went through a reverse split bringing the total share float to around 74 million shares. Estimates place revenue next year to be somewhere around 20 billion dollars which will be realistic once the EU or the UK or another major Western country approves the vaccine. Indonesia was the first to approve it and the Philippines approved it today for emergency use. The filings have been completed in multiple countries and a full biological use authorization has been requested in South Korea.

Not only is there huge potential for the share price to skyrocket because of the low float but there is decent short interest in this stock and if it is successful it will carve out market share from Johnson &amp; Johnson Pfizer and Moderna, as well as address vaccinations globally which are lacking and still a very large market.

It is also likely that many people will choose to get a yearly covid shot just like they do a flu shot because the coronavirus will become endemic.

I do think current EV valuation are absolutely a bubble and as much as I think hydrogen would have been a better direction than EV, at this point market momentum is unstoppable.

But what I think nearly everyone overlooks is that if all the cars currently on the road changed to EVs basically no country would have enough electricity production capacity to power them. Add to that the continued increase in server infrastructure and I see a big upside for electricity production companies. It's a very safe investment, an essential utility and specifically for USA the new infrastructure bill should help them.

Intro

All right you guys all know what Playboy is and why they are an iconic brand so lets skip that shit. Lets also put the normal fundamental analysis P/E bullshit to the side to start off with and focus on actual relevant fundamentals in todays meme cycling market.

Basic shit most of you would consider enough info to go balls deep on any given stock

PLBY is sitting at $38 a share with a market cap of 1.547b as of the close on Friday. The company has 40.8m shares outstanding with only 17.39m of those available as public float. The short interest is sitting somewhere between 19% and 28% but is impossible to pinpoint exactly since the numbers vary vastly between Bloomberg, Ortex and other sources which are often very delayed.

NF-Tits


Playboy has already announced their expansion of art offerings not only with physical prints but NF-Titss as well. Their first NF-Tits project is called Rabbitars and has some dumb looking rabbits on them, it sold out in a few minutes. They could also literally just slap a picture of the classic bunny in various colors into NF-Tits or they could even be about to sell classic covers of the magazine. Imagine how many dudes in their 50s right now had their first ever jerk to a Playboy magazine and are now rich as fuck looking at various ways to enter the digital age of investing, nostalgia is the most powerful emotion. This plan is literally unfuckable and will always guarantee them strong revenue even if the old fucks dont get in, Playboys intellectual property is priceless.

OnlyFans  Centerfold

Playboy recently announced their competitor to OnlyFans called Centerfold which will be released soon. For those unfamiliar (probably only like 2 or 3 of you sick fucks) OnlyFans is an internet content subscription service where most of the content is porn or some kind of soft porn shit. OnlyFans generated more than $2b in sales in 2020 and has an estimated worth just shy of $13b. Dont think its necessary to explain the appeal of jumping over to a service deployed by Playboy, all the bitches want to be Playboy bunnies even though they wouldnt admit it. There is no fucking chance that PLBY will be sitting at a $1.5b mkt cap after this shit launches.

Product Portfolio

On the 10th of August Playboy announced their Acquisition of Honey Birdette, a lingerie and bra thing which chicks apparently love and they sell a lot of shit.

Ill skip going into their other product portfolio and instead just link their investor presentation, its on pages 22-26:https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/3cc8cc18-d6fd-4193-8dcc-d62199a21642

Meme-ability

This fucking stock hits all the boxes of a meme-able stock. High short interest, low market cap &amp; breasts.  Fun fact in this regard is thatu/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR, one of the moderators ofr/wallstreetbetsis the only mod on ther/PLBYsub.

Boring Fundamental Shit

PLBY is trading at a Price-to-book value of 3.6 which is fucking ridiculous for a company possessing the incredible value of the intellectual property they own. They lost $23.5m in 2019 and only $5.27m in 2020 indicating a move towards profitability without the additions of NF-Titss and OnlyFans V2. Who gives a fuck about the rest. Centerfold is scheduled to be released in Q4 so the earnings call Monday will probably be focused on that. Stocks only go up, also Metaverse.

&gt;Strikingly, net worth is still mostly tangible. While investment in intangible assets has grown relative to investment in tangible assets in many countries when broadly measured, under current accounting standards, intellectual propertyincluding research and development, software, and original artworksis assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence. On paper, intellectual property products make up less than 4 percent of global net worth and real assets. Intangibles do, however, generate economic returns. The OECD reported in 2015 that intangible assets had expected returns of 24 percent, the highest rate among produced asset categories.

my first question is specific. **what does this sentence mean**: ""under current accounting standards, intellectual propertyincluding research and development, software, and original artworksis assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence."" **what are you investing in, when you invest in google, if not in the value of its intellectual property?** i realize google has not been around for very long, in the grand scheme of things, but it would be quite a surprise if it weren't still a major player in five years, no?

now my questions start to get vague.

if you read someone like buffett or sam altman, you leave thinking that only productive things are valuable (buffett likes a sure linear function; altman likes a possible exponential function), but that is obviously in some sense absurd, not just because valuable things are also valuable, but also because it is not at all clear that there is a clear distinction between things that are valuable for being productive and those that are valuable for having a personal canon of historical value. (indeed, altman does make caveats for land, even at the crescendi of his [hymn to productivity](https://moores.samaltman.com/).) again, from the mckinsey report:

&gt;The global economy has undergone a vast transformation over the past two decades, as rapid technological progress including digitization has taken hold and investment in intangible assets has soared. Yet over this same period, global wealth has grown largely as a result of the rising value of household real estate, a historical store of value

my rough read (very possible that this is not just a simplification, but downright inaccurate) is that they (mckinsey) basically attribute this discrepancy to loose monetary policy  i.e., it has been, on average, easier to increase net worth by taking out a loan, buying a tangible/valuable thing, and paying off that loan, than by buying an intangible/productive thing.

**but then why are all the largest companies in the world precisely those that principally (?) own intangible/productive things (tech)?**

i read [something](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/) recently that includes a lemma (see the ""Scratching the surface"" section), referencing another [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3667309), to the effect that the housing valuations in 2008 were in some sense *not* inflated, insofar as the run-up basically amounted to an increasingly accurate assessment, on the demand side, of the intrinsic (even *productive*) value of living in certain properties.

i think the best tl;dr, here, is that i am becoming increasingly suspicious of the distinction, which seems pervasive (especially the higher up you go in the intellectual totem pole), between speculation, on the one hand, and investment in productive/technological assets, on the other.

not really done with this, but [no one gives us any time any more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnokW3Mw24), so i'm just going to post it and make edits/clarifications later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw5rfw/value_of_an_asset_vs_expected_return_from_that/

I'm a car nerd, especially the history of cars/car companies. 

Have you heard of a guy by the name of Lee Iacocca? 

Quick history lesson - He was the driving force behind the Ford Mustang, Escort, Lincoln Continental and made Ford 2 billion dollars *the year he was fired by Henry Ford II for having TOO MANY GOOD IDEAS*

Like two weeks later he was the CEO of an almost bankrupt Chrysler, where he turned the company around pretty much immediately by doing things Hank the deuce told him not to like invent the minivan and buy Jeep before introducing the Grand Cherokee. 

What does this have to do with GOEV?

Remember that song ""if I had a million dollars""? 

&gt;And if I had a million dollars 
&gt;Well I'd buy you a K-Car
&gt;A nice reliant automobile

The K car was one of my man Lee Iacoccas first moves at Chrysler (besides borrowing 1.5 Billion from Paul ""tall 80s J-Pow"" Volcker, which he paid back 7 years early because they didnt know where to put all that sweet sweet Iacocca cash).

He looked at the inefficiencies in having to have multiple platforms for multiple cars, and decided that having multiple models sharing the same engine/suspension/subframe etc... would massively decrease manufacturing costs. 

They could build a baller ass Chrysler New Yorker from almost the same parts as a shitbox Dodge Aries, and even the early model Caravans. 

Anyway before I use up all my 12 year old macbooks RAM making deepfake porn of Lee Iacocca railing my exwife I want to tell you how this is relevant. 

GOEV are manufacturing the following three vehicles

[Crossover SUV!](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/)

[Delivery Vehicle!](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/)

[Pickup Truck!](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/)

All using the **same platform**

I assume they will have a dope car on this platform as well. But I do like that they have gone after practical use vehicles first. 

Theres a cock ton of financial DD on WSB involving financially nerdy things like numbers, but there are a few that really stand out to me. 

Lucid 
* 575 cars presumed to be produced in 2021
* EPS -$300
* Market Cap $85 Billion

Rivian 
* 0 cars produced 
* EPS -$16
* Market Cap $128 Billion

Nio - 
* 100000 cars produced
* EPS -$1
* Market Cap $64 Billion

GOEV
* 0 cars produced 
* EPS -$0.90
* Market Cap $2.5 Billion

You can see this company is insanely undervalued as far as goodwill share value goes, compared to companies that have yet to sell one car as well as one (NIO) a little further into its life as an EV company. 

Its losing less per share, and if it hit a market cap of Lucid at $85 Billion that translates to like $42ish per share. 

They will be producing cars next year, and a rumoured walmart deal would send this into the stratosphere. 

In conclusion, if anyone can lend me some computing space for my auto executive/ex wife deepfake porn fetish hit me up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw5n7d/why_goev_are_the_best_value_ev_play_right_now_and/

Paypal after dropping from 310.16 from the high. Now seems to be a good potential for averaging in. At this price Paypal seems to be extremely attractive. Paypal is a well establish company with a huge capital market cap of US$253.4 Billion and it is listed in 11 stock exchanges. 

**Stable Growing Profit Margin** 

Profit Margin as of 30 sep is 20.1% and they have been growing significantly by 26.8% per annual over the past 5 years. 

**Healthy Financial** 

Debt to Equity ratio is 40.5% ( Total Debt 8947 million to  Total Equity 22,090 million) 

The debt are well covered by operating cash flow (66.2%) 

Interest Payments are well covered by EBIT (24.7x) 

**Business is on the right track** 

**Partnering with Amazon** 

Paypal is on the right track on tieing up with the trillion market cap giant - Amazon on the Venmo payments, which will enable the e-commerce giant to start accepting Venmo payments in 2022. Venmo is already a peer-to-peer payments leader with over 80 million customers, but it's facing tough competition from Square's Cash App, which surpassed 70 million annual active users earlier this year. Partnering with Amazon will generate fresh tailwinds for Venmo and help the service maintain its narrow lead. 

**Cryptocurrency** 

They are on cryptocurrency business too. 

**PayPal's user base continues to grow**

PayPal ended the third quarter with 416 million active accounts, and its total payment volume (TPV) hit $310 billion. Those core metrics, along with its total revenue, have consistently grown by double digits year over year. 

During the earnings call, CEO Dan Schulman said PayPal still remained ""quite confident"" in its goal of hitting 750 million active accounts in 2025. That target, which supports another goal of generating more than $50 billion of revenue by that same year, implies its active accounts will increase at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of nearly 15% over the next four years.

That expansion relies on the ability of PayPal's new ""super app"" -- which bundles together a digital wallet, a savings account, peer-to-peer payments, bill payments, direct deposits, cryptocurrency services, BNPL (buy now, pay later) services, and other offerings -- to lock in its users, widen its moat against rivals like Square, and reduce its churn rates.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw4rx7/cheap_stocks_to_buy_for_now/

1,"11/18/2021, 01:31:08",One Word For You: I Bet I Can Beat the S&amp;P 500,FinancialWhoas,"TLDR:  I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a  selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.

# Observations/Assumptions

Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.

* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you dont want to support.
   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, thats because it is.

# Hypothesis

Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.

# Experiment 2020

750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:

* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2
* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)

ROE Example

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors.

[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)

**2020 Industry Breakdown**

These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021

* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**
* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**

Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin  shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin  shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin  shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin  shows a companies operating profitability
* ROE  shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA  shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC  shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio  shows the financial stability of a company

More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%,  Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesnt match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:

[Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the companys most recent year):

[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:

[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)

I  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,  I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasnt interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because its oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but Id  need to build a separate model.

I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \~75.

We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:

[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.

2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:

* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**
* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that arent really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.

$RDW is a company that makes components for space travel and space exploration. They currently have partnerships with NASA and Blue Origin. There is also rumors of them partnering with Amazon soon. 

Their closest peer is trading at a 2.3b valuation. While theyre trading at about 750 million valuation. The company trading at the higher valuation ($VLTR) revenues were 23 million for 2021 while RDW were 163 million. Plus $RDW is cash flow positive. Earnings were delayed, but the earnings should push the stock higher as well. 

On the low end this should be a $15-20 stock. The upside to that is huge if they announce a partnership with Amazon. Should trade at $30-40 at that point.

Buy $RDW and have tendies",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw3s9l/rdw_tendies_incoming/

1,"11/18/2021, 00:47:27",One Word For You: I Bet I Can Beat the S&amp;P 500,FinancialWhoas,"TLDR: I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below. My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.

# Observations/Assumptions

Before you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions, not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can jump down my throat.

* Companies with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies missing one or more of those attributes.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp) even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you dont want to support.
   * Due to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020, forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price, which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, thats because it is.

# Hypothesis

Using industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.

# Experiment 2020

750 largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index. For example, each companies average ROE of the last 4 years was compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:

* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2
* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was 10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%, they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example below on ROE:

[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/unapdml3m6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d615130616fb32c179674306cb461d3c0dcb2d)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. 

**2020 Industries**

[2020 Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/o9llcazgm6081.png?width=386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64e5c541e836a173e373113b5d13cc5b7648f57a)

These 26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021

* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**
* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**

Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850 tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list. The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin  shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin  shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin  shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin  shows a companies operating profitability
* ROE  shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA  shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC  shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio  shows the financial stability of a company

More metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

 3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%, Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a score of 23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119. Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesnt match the original input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:

[Aerospace and Defense Example Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/s80995tpo6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fbc4aa6a06985cbedd1d4bf26d678b94bcc977)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the companys most recent year):

[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/12pnpz90p6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d32a3469e261be37cba38f28c9ca39ef0552e0)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:

[Data Visualizations](https://preview.redd.it/112baw12p6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c55275971eba7f3f0d316f84a275da53572fcf8)

I applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next, I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasnt interested in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because its oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but Id need to build a separate model.

I then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83 companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:

**Industry**

[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/r9rt903pp6081.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95168c9e7c65cf548f4bd7c4be45ffaf9b1ac46b)

I then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.

2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:

* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**
* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other that arent really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10 stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such as biotech and pharmaceutical.

Cannabis sector on fire

Current bullish momentum has been motivated by recent news regarding legalization. A bill [drafted](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/cannabis-stocks-rise-on-legalization-hopes-tim-seymour-talks-the-move.html)  by South Carolina House Rep. Nancy Mace to regulate cannabis could make  the substance legal in the United States. Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF  portfolio manager weighed on the news:

&gt;*\[It**s\] huge news for a market that was not expecting de-scheduling or a federal outcome.*

Third-party [data](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/legal-cannabis-market-size-worth-91-5-billion-by-2028--cagr-26-3-grand-view-research-inc-301341758.html)  suggests that the legal cannabis market will reach an impressive $91  billion by 2028, implying an imposing CAGR of 26%. As medical cannabis  continues to become legal around the world, further legalization can be  the key catalyst to boost product demand.  


 Aside from momentum, Sundials management team thinks that the company is on track to create shareholder value. [According](https://sundialcorpprod.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/rZeYw1PaCRBKzJrdLsAsGjyJ?sp=r&amp;sv=2016-05-31&amp;se=2021-11-12T15:02:28Z&amp;rscd=inline;+filename=%252522Sundial+Growers+Inc.+-+Q2+2021+FS.pdf%252522;+filename*=UTF-8%27%27Sundial%25252520Growers%25252520Inc.%25252520-%25252520Q2%252525202021%25252520FS.pdf&amp;rsct=application/pdf&amp;sr=b&amp;sig=jEkcjS9gLmTv6bVT66PnyKr8q5Yn3/uFJ3VI61w8XWg=)  to CEO Zach George, balance sheet strength enables \[the executive\]  team to avoid short term pressures while working to improve the quality  of our decision making. He thinks that meeting Sundials financial  goals should lead to positive free cash flow in 2022.   


excerpt from ""Investorplace"" [https://investorplace.com/2021/11/sndl-stock-seems-way-overdue-for-a-big-rally-soon/](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/sndl-stock-seems-way-overdue-for-a-big-rally-soon/)

### Growth From Investments

If we look at Sundials business model, there are two sources of growth.

First, Sundial has investments (equity, debt and hybrid) in various  cannabis companies. These investments are a source of regular cash  flow.Further, Sundial has its own cannabis brand portfolio. The company  is focused on inhalables and has been vertically integrating in Canada.

Sundial generated $25.2 million in revenue from investment  operations. This already implies an annualized revenue potential of $50  million.

There are two important points to note from a growth perspective in this segment 

First, Sundial has a 50:50 joint venture with **SAF Group**. The JV intends to create a portfolio of debt, equity and hybrid instruments. Sundial has [committed $538 million towards the joint venture](https://www.sndlgroup.com/press_releases/sundial-increases-commitment-to-sunstream-bancorp-inc-by-350-million).

As the portfolio of its investments swells, the income from investment operations is likely to increase significantly.

Furthermore, Sundial expects the global legal [cannabis market to touch $47 billion by 2025](https://sundialcorpprod.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/8AeUAYv8kUPSeppBAs1uyze7?sp=r&amp;sv=2016-05-31&amp;se=2021-11-08T06%3A35%3A00Z&amp;rscd=inline%3B+filename%3D%22Sundial-Corporate-Presentation-Aug-2021-4.pdf%22%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8%27%27Sundial-Corporate-Presentation-Aug-2021-4.pdf&amp;rsct=application%2Fpdf&amp;sr=b&amp;sig=d0gXAOsu6e%2BGmYgfWis8MJVAM4DBp6iDDbJVVxIDW58%3D). This would imply a 130% growth in market size as compared to 2020.

Therefore, if the joint venture is successful in making the right  investment decisions, cash flow from the business segment can be  meaningful in the long term.  


The positive outlook

&amp;#x200B;

1. When  compared to the same quarter last year, net earnings improved from a  $71.4 million loss to a $11.3 million gain. This is a significant  improvement and we will monitor how the business performs in future  quarters
2. Adjusted  EBITDA came in at $10.5 million for the quarter, which is a substantial  improvement from the $4.4 million adjusted EBITDA loss that was  reported in the third quarter of 2020.
3. As  of November 9th, Sundial reported to have $1.2 billion of cash,  marketable securities and long-term investments. The company has $571  million of unrestricted cash and no outstanding debt. We are surprised  by the strength of its balance sheet and consider this to be a core  pillar of the long-term story.
4. During  the quarter, Sundials average cost per gram sold increased to $3.23  from $2.67. The increase was primarily due to an increase in prices for  sales to other Canadian LPs and we find this to be an important metric.
5. Sundial  continued to execute on a expansion strategy that is centered around on  making strategic investments and we consider some of its deals to be  transformational. Due to the strength of the balance sheet, we expect  the management team to announced additional accretive transactions in  2022.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw3czn/big_gamma_squeeze_sndl_and_the_big_picture_the/

1,"11/18/2021, 00:31:23",Gravity Battery,PennyStockWorth,"Most recently Energy Vault went into merger agreement with Novus Capital Corporation II (SPAC) valuing them at $1.6 billion. Energy Vault uses a system that stores energy using potential energy to store it, and gravity to release it back to the grid.

If youre someone whos investing in electrification and renewable energy, theres a good chance this purple unicorn (Energy Vault) slipped past your radar. If theres one thing we noticed in 2020-2021 is how fast moving the electric transportation industry is accelerating: Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Fisker, Ford, GM, Electric planes, electric trucks, etc.

The driving catalyst for this shift in transportation is the environment set by countries (reducing greenhouse gases) like US, Canada, France, Germany, and more. There are many methods to produce renewable energy but only two of them can be used almost everywhere, and they are Solar &amp; Wind.

Wind is currently the leader of renewable energy, followed by hydro and then solar. The main problem with Wind and solar energy is the lack of control we get on how much energy we output and when. Some days the wind is stronger/weaker creating fluctuations. Some days theres less sun exposure and as we know at night solar energy cant be generated.

Currently to solve these issues, we produce much more wind energy then needed and ground the excess energy. We also use Lead batteries with solar &amp; wind (they dont store much) to store some electricity and release it at a constant rate. These solutions are ok for now. If we decide to ever rely 100% on renewable energy, these solutions we currently have would cause a catastrophe occasionally inevitably.

A very good solution was presented not too long ago by a company called Energy Vault. Energy Vault offers a sustainable solution to store energy. Their energy storage is immune to all weather conditions. The only thing that needs to remain constant is the gravitational pull of the earth. Their technology is complex yet simple. They produce electricity similarly to most of the current energy production solutions. They rotate a turbine generator to generate electricity.

Energy Vault uses a tower with 6 cranes to lift/lower composite blocks. When excess energy is produced, the electricity is given to the system to use the energy to lift the blocks into storage tower form. When the grid needs more power, the system would then use little power to commence the lowering of blocks, which would create power. (Rope &amp; Pulley system to rotate turbine generator)

The system's round trip efficiency is 85% while the life expectancy for the whole system is 40 years. These numbers are very impressive. There is one storage system that is currently more efficient, and its Pumped hydroelectric storage facilities, although it requires elevated grounds and much more money upfront to construct such a system. Energy Vaults towers can be used anywhere and can be scaled up or down. Additionally the energy storage towers can be scaled in increments of 10 MWh reaching up to multi-GWh storage towers.

Energy Vault is quite unique because not only does it fit in the energy storage market, but it can also eat some chunks away from the renewable energy market. When budgets are made for renewable energy, theres always a safety factor that requires significantly more energy produced then needed. This safety factor can be reduced drastically when the system is combined with a reliable solution such as Energy Vaults energy storage tower.

Lots of experts believe if exponential growth continues from solar and wind energy, they could see a market share above 50% of all energy produced by 2033. Energy Vault is a company that would complement wind and solar energy, making it a more reliable option.

One of the nicest things about this company is their ability to grow. They use local construction companies to support their projects. This allows them to commence multiple storage projects in different places around the world without the need to finish one first.

Over the next 10 years, the cumulative investment in grid-related storage required is estimated at $270 Billion. The current solutions other than Pumped hydroelectric storage facilities are not truly sustainable. Energy Vaults solution can be used anywhere, any-time, and its sustainable and scalable. Its also unique and hard to replicate without facing major complications which Energy Vault solved and protected under patent.

I would not be surprised to see Energy Vault take 25-50% of the sustainable energy storage market by 2027, additionally I believe they will take 10-15% market away from solar/wind farm energy projects above 1 GWh.

Energy Vault is a key part of the solution to convert all energy into green energy. Now its the best solution which can work anywhere and anytime. If youre someone who believes in our movements working towards their 2030-2050 carbon neutral targets, then you might want to keep an eye on Energy Vault.

Energy Vault went into agreement to provide 1.6 GWh energy storage capacity with DG Fuels LLC. This agreement would provide up to $520 million in revenue across the three projects which would begin in mid-2022.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw32kq/gravity_battery/

I've mention this about a week prior about 'pulling an Engine No. 1' to unlock value in both $F and $GM.

Surprisingly, Engine No. 1 is a shareholder in GM:

Could Engine No. 1 force a breakup eventually if their current plan fails to unlock value?

Now, that $RIVN and $LCID is worth as much as $GM, it only going to be a matter of time before analysis and shareholders have them look into this idea to unlock value. As a shareholder, I would be scratching my head knowingly, $GM or $F could possible double if they breakup and value can unlock quickly now, instead of years.  If a lot of you apes band together and vote on a simple resolution to break it up during proxy volte, it can create a lot of noise. Even if it never happens, stock price will moves simply base on news and rumors of breakup.  That's good enough for the stock to rocket higher without even breaking it up.

1,"11/18/2021, 00:16:27",Do not buy ATVI,corybrzo,"There is very high risk investing in that company and only the possibility for mild gains at best. These scandals are nonstop and point to something deep-rooted in the company. Besides this, there are bigger issues affecting ATVI's profits, because let's face it, players don't care enough about these scandals alone to stop playing; this was just the nail in the coffin for many.

The bigger issue is content. I can only speak for the Blizzard side (the activision side is carrying blizzard's dead weight atm) but there has been a MAJOR content drought for their 2 biggest games, WoW and Overwatch. In fact, Overwatch has not had any new, real, substantial content for almost 2 YEARS. The community was starting to fade even before this. They have neglected overwatch to put all work into the sequel, OW2, which is primarily single-player campaign modes. OW got popular from their player versus player scene, so this game will be somewhat of a flop (at least for the half decade of development put into it). In addition, they've delayed the game numerous time, with the most recent delay being likely until late 2022 or even 2023.  


WoW Battle for Azeroth created community discontent, which isn't that unusual. But players expected Shadowlands to be good as a result. There was major hype but the community in the game died down hard after less than a year and mostly didn't come back. The game doesn't value players' time and blizz refuses to address player greviences about the game in a timely manor. Additionally, there is a huge lack of content which drives players away quickly because they get bored. Their most recent major patch 9.1, had a mild spike in active players in the middle of the year only to lose them within a month or two. There are usually 3 major patches per expansion, and this expansion there will be only 2 on top of lackluster content.   


Besides my personal opinion on the state of the games, the community sentiment had been terrible, with many major streamers and YouTubers heralding a ""mass exodus"" of blizzard games, partially causing it to happen in a self--fulfilling prophecy. Also, numerous metrics from numerous sources for player count and active player base have dropped extremely drastically.  


Many blizzard players are cross-game players, meaning if one game loses players due to company dissatisfaction, then the other games will also not live up to their potential.   


People can look at the company's numbers and see they have declined in revenue over at least a year. All the fancy talk from corporate about content and fancy numbers that are touted are all very misleading. The technical analysis doesn't matter either. Their communities have quite literally had a mass exodus and grown spiteful of the company for countless reasons, losing this community's longstanding strong loyalty",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw2r2o/do_not_buy_atvi/

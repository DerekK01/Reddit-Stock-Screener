1,"11/20/2021, 22:43:06",Retailer Earnings Report next week:,OrcaBull,"We are partway through retailer earnings reports. Next week, **Dollar Tree, Burlington stores, Abercrombie &amp; Finch, American Eagle Outfitters** will report between Monday close and Tuesday open. **Gap, Nortdstrom, Guess** will report between Tuesday close and Wednesday open. These are my positions: 

https://preview.redd.it/93a2dbcwar081.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e48519d8f858a96eca653c76eac3a31377ed17

&amp;#x200B;

We are seeing strong consumer demand as is evident from retailers that have reported already. The issue on top of mind this quarter is supply chain. As long as a company does not run into issues operationally they should pop after earnings. The moment a company mentions supply chain issues, the market punishes them severely mostly because if they have issues now then they would have more issues during holiday season when higher volume of merchandise is needed. Moreover, most retailers make most of their money during holiday season. Markets are forward-looking and want assurance that companies will have the goods for the next 6 weeks. 

We are also seeing a trend that retailers with the following characteristics are outperforming: 1. targeting mostly affluent clients. 2. Client base that is mostly teen or female. 3. Less reliance on container ships and China. 4. Management that is willing to hide supply chain issues. 5. Mostly US/Canada stores vs Europe.  Last week we saw Footlocker and Ross Stores drop hard on supply chain issues. Ross has always had a thin supply chain. That one was predictable in hindsight. 

Macro trends are going to affect the prices on Monday. Friday was a day that market got spooked by fears of virus and lock downs. Just look at The Buckle chart from Friday. It opened at 57$ but dropped to $50 by the end of the day. That is more than 12% move intra-day! A true WTF chart. 

https://preview.redd.it/ecq2vhfscr081.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4a556e9db2d96bd672b8e41cfef448de8008997

&amp;#x200B;

It is hard to predict what market sentiment will be on Monday but I was betting that it would be more positive. On Friday I closed all my shorts and went shopping (pun intended) for retailers that were trading at a discount to fair value. If they are down on Monday then it's worth picking up some more. Even if they open +2% \~ +4% (which I think will happen) they are worth considering. I would stay away from Burlington, Urban outfitters, and Guess. Burlington is targeting less affluent clients than Nordstrom. Urban outfitters as a lot of operational issues that make it less able to execute compared to American Eagle or Abercrombie. Guess has more European clients than Gap. I expect Gap to run up on Tuesday if AEO or ANF report good numbers. If Guess runs up as well I may short it as a hedge for a potential Gap trade. 

My models have lead me to believe Nordstrom will perform more like Macy's than Target. Nordstrom won't have supply chain issues like others. It has mostly an affluent, female client base. It does not rely on container stores and is able to tap into different suppliers to keep stores stocked. (Oh we are out of Fendi, no worries I have some FCKU in size 5).   

[The first chart is Macy's. The right one is Target. ](https://preview.redd.it/bmvfqa0icr081.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cb2931ef0ac5fd4ee6ac876929f372c111ec2e8)

I didn't talk about Dollar Tree but everything about that company excites me. It would be a 10 page DD that I don't have time for but let's just say I am bullish and will probably add to my position. Mantle Ridge sees the same potential that I do. Management has shown willingness to unlock value for the investors as demonstrated when they appeased Starboard 2\~3 years ago. Under pressure from Mantle Ridge to replace CEO, I expect in the quarterly report to hear a lot about strong consumer demand and strategies to improve costumer monetization (such as introducing $1.50 and $2.00 price points). Their hand is forced due to inflation. It is a matter of time.

Their strategy to profitability lies in the rapid growth of legalized sports betting in the USA.

Meanwhile, NKLA, an absolute scam with five years of broken promises, no actual product, no actual product on the horizon. A total disaster in every way. The market cap is $4.8 Billion.

DKNG, which is strictly sports betting and online casino (in a tiny amount of states where it is legal), is hemorrhaging all kinds of money. They performed far worse than they anticipated last quarter, have an extremely long road to profitability (if ever achieved), and a substantial chance the company will ultimately fail. The market cap is $14.7 Billion.

MarketWatch reports that FUBO had a short interest of 16% of the float on October 29th. This is right before FUBO stock went from $29.5 to $35 and then crashed on earnings. My guess is that short selling exploded as the stock ran from up to 35, and then shorts have just continued to pile on for the past two weeks, fueling a fall from 35 to 21.50.

Each day FUBO has seemed like low-hanging fruit only to go even lower the next day. At some point soon, I expect to see a dramatic rip to the upside, even if it is short-lived.

1,"11/20/2021, 22:33:23","PLTR - Q3 Government Revenue Declined vs Q2, But May Not Be Bad",Last_Win_6878,"First time posting out of frustration of the PLTR stock price.  Meant to Post of r/PLTR but I need 100 Karma to post there so I am posting here first.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I think we all agree that stock price after Q3 earning has been disappointing. We all want answers but we are not getting detailed information on Youtube or Reddit, and Q3 earning call didnt really help answer anything. PLTR community doesnt seem as strong as TSLA community where I can get massive amount of information such as drone footages of new factories, factory and port parking lots and so on,,,,,

So I decided to just read and get whatever information I can get from all available 10Q and 10K.  And I have some interesting finding that explains Analysts doubt that may not be a problem at all.

**Quarterly Revenue Trend**

https://preview.redd.it/nk5mjdr1fr081.png?width=715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35f9453edddd8867d8122fc8952ca23fe50d43b4

Above is the quarterly revenue that I had to gather from 10Qs, PLTR doesnt provide a simple chart like that anywhere. When you look at the revenue, we can understand why the Analysts called out Government revenue as a problem. Decline in sales for a growth company is never good. It is not like a retailer going from Q4 to Q1. Government contracts are suppose to be stable and grow,,,,

https://preview.redd.it/2pq2dfv3fr081.png?width=715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd301909070ddf8fa2b5725ca824fbf7e193b4b9

But, when you look at the Revenue by countries, we can assume that at least the quarterly decline wasnt from the US government. Revenue decline occurred with Rest of World. So looking at the two charts, we can assume the Government revenue outside of US had decline.

**Three Phases of Customers (Cohort: Acquire, Expand, Scale)**

 On further 10Q digging, I found a section regarding three phase of customer cohort. It is on page 28 of Q3 10-Q.

Acquire  less than $100,000 per year customers

Expansion  more than $100,000 per year customers with negative margin

Scale  more than $100,000 per year customers with positive margin

**2019 Customer Cohort** 

https://preview.redd.it/4viarm0rdr081.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f429bbfa0fbbf45f2fe8d46405d09bb245bb105

 

What above chart indicate is that group of customers (Acquire) in 2019 that generated $600K of sales and -$65.4M of contribution margin in 2019, becomes $77.1M revenue and $13.2M contribution margin in 2020.  (128X in revenue YOY)

Expand groups Revenue goes from $176.3M in 2019 to $360.4M in 2020. -$75.8M in 2019 to $169.4M contribution margin in 2020. (2X in revenue YOY)

So Palantir's new customers grows fast. And Margin grows fast too. Palantir also puts their efforts on Acquire and Expand customers.  (shown in the negative margin, this turn positive year after)

Above information was so intriguing that I also made one for 2020 Customer Cohort. And I had to make all these charts, Palantir doesnt give you this information in a simple chart,,, you need to read all 10Qs to summarize this information.

**2020 Customer Cohort** 

https://preview.redd.it/11148jgker081.png?width=385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95ab9badb07edd3ee9718b843fd71e1b8da7111

Similar story from the 2020 Customer Cohorts. Acquire customers grow from $300K to $15.6M YTD in revenue, -$36.8M to -$7.1M in contribution margin. (I assume positive margin after Q4, that was the case with 2019 Acquire cohort).

Expand cohort goes from $20.3M to $62.1M YTD in revenue. -$32.3M to $27.9M in contribution margin. And we notice the Q2 Blip. Roughly $20M, that is somewhat inline with Government contract and Rest of World revenue in increase Q2 and decline in Q3.

\*I created NEW customer cohort in the chart by doing math from actual Quarterly Revenue and Contribution margin.

\*\*NEW customer group in Q3-2021 generated $29M, $19M was from the companies they invested.

 **TOP 20 Customers**

https://preview.redd.it/qxew6kxyer081.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=832970d217a0ae4471c1c446f4450751b45e9deb

Palantir has TOP 20 customers growing their spending with Palantir at 35% rate. This speaks for it self. And looks like the growth is all organic. Palantir is growting SCALE cohorts contribution margin%. The product must be good. Do you purchase 35% more on anything that you think is not good while there are other options?

**Conclusion**

Revenue and Contribution margin increased everywhere as expected, except for Q2 Rest of World- Government-Expand cohort. And France (I assume Airbus contract is saturated, business is just steady, or even grow once travelling starts)

This revenue blip also provided $20M+ Contribution margin in Q2-2021. Since this Q2 to Q3 decline occurred with Expand group, I am going to assume this wasnt a lost of contract. I think it may be more to do with payment term/schedule(???), may be this government agency pay once a year or every other quarter(?). If this agency starts paying more regularly then we will see higher growth rate in Q4 vs Q3. We can look for this clue from next 10-K. Having said that my I am bias and my interpretation can be bias.

Overall growth story is intact, big customers are purchasing more, all new customers in 2021 will become massive revenue growth story in 2022, and margin growth in 2023.  This cycle will continue.  I have no doubt, as long as there is no other company like PLTR, and unless SG&amp;A expanse increase faster to than the revenue growth.

My feeling toward PLTR is like what I felt toward TSLA in mid 2019.  Back then I didn't understand why TSLA stock was going down,,,, Analysts laughed at Giga Shanghai (mud field),,, but once everything aligned, stock price went up. And PLTR 10Qs are showing me that PLTR will have a similar story within 2 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy6rwt/pltr_q3_government_revenue_declined_vs_q2_but_may/

INOVIO IS BEING GROOMED AS ""THE ONE""

The runway has been cleared for INO to take off. Phase 3 is just a formality. The US cannot publicly admit it yet, but we are losing the fight against Covid. The rest of the world however, is sounding the alarm. And without Pfizer and Moderna to coddle, is looking ahead for the ""next"" solution.

And they have found it. It's been right here all along.

As I've stated previously, there is no other serious player. The world is looking for an actual cure (i.e. a vaccine defined in its classical sense--something that eradicates disease and stops transmission.)

The trials are the formal process, but the rollout is already determined. While the extra 14 month delay has been maddening to shareholders, it has turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The extra time has added legitimacy to the belief that INO did not cut corners. From animal studies, through peer reviews, and sequential Phase testing, INO has progressed in a traditional and respected manner.

While Pfizer and Moderna have done much to reduce infection and severity of disease, there is a widespread acceptance of the notion that efficacy; clearance from body; side effects; and logistical stability could all be markedly improved. And there is certainly a belief that they were too quickly approved without knowing the possible consequences.

This has created a vacuum that nobody but INO is positioned to fill. The FDA lift this past week was tacit acknowledgement of this fact by the US. THEY HAVE COME CRAWLING BACK.

Booster shots will clearly be the game now. Boosters that can follow ANY initial vaccine; Boosters that produce no side effects (even with increased or repeated dosing); and boosters that can be transported and stored anywhere on the planet).

The orders are going to come pouring in. The manufacturing consortium is in place. The company's organizational structure has been set. The global community (sadly led by China and not US) is in lockstep behind.

The world is ready to kick some Covid a$$. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

You either believe or you don't.

You're either long or you're short.

You're either in or you're out.

For those with tickets on this train, you're about to have the ride of your life.

Previous DD: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3g44/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/)

I'm gonna be the uranium version of The Intel ~~Bag Holder~~ DD man.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming you're familiar with the overarching uranium bull thesis (if no, check out [DD 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3g44/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/)), here I dive into the concept of using the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) as a financial nuke.

The [concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnyso1/the_sprott_uranium_fund_is_a_self_reinforcing/) isn't new, it was already around when I first got into uranium back in September, but recently, it took a fall out of the limelight due to the supposedly thin spot market being thicker than expected.

Fresh [DD](https://www.segracapital.com/commentary/you-say-you-want-a-revolution) from  u/JekyllCapital of UTwitter had me thinking again.

The DD basically expose a few more sources of uranium on the spot market.

First, being pseudo-options fuckery using terms from old contracts

Second, existing holders of physical uranium converting their holdings into SPUT units.

Third, time fuckery with carry traders.

The impact is basically shifting around the supply from the past and the future into the present. Key takeaway is that these ""new"" sources are one-offs and we will eventually get through them with time and money.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, we're basically guaranteed to go up from current prices to prices where smaller miners can also profit enough to justify starting up their mines.

However, the optimal time for a ""squeeze"" is the timeframe before the mines open back up. It's during this time that the utilities really have to fight over every last pound. Whatever you and I bid, they have the bid higher or face revenue loss from their reactors shutting down. Once the mines are up and running, it's easier to ramp up production, resulting in lesser pressure on the utilities.

&amp;#x200B;

For positions, I think U.UN is the safest. Apart from a sudden crisis that fucks nuclear energy over again politically, uranium prices will definitely go higher than the current levels. Uranium ETFs are like spice for the retards, don't know enough to evaluate individual companies so why not buy them all? Me? URA 45C Jan 2023.

1,"11/20/2021, 20:14:04",Due Dilligence of a French Nuclear Company (building + operating plants) with 69 billion euro revenue (2020),DiversificationNoob,"[Basic data](https://www.finanzen.net/bilanz_guv/edf):

market cap: 40 billion euro

yearly revenue (average of last 5 years): 70.03 billion euros

yearly profits (average of last 5 years): 2.04 billion euros

EDF is a partly state owned electricity company in France. Their main energy source: nuclear power. [90 % of their capacity is nuclear](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/france.aspx). They got a [nuclear generation capacity of 61 GW](https://www.statista.com/statistics/763065/installed-electric-capacity-energy-source-edf-france/). Normally nuclear is used as a base load and at full capacity. Since nuclear makes up almost all of the french electric energy supply they got a lot more capacity than they usually used to be able to react to peak demands. Their [capacity factor was usually in the 70 % range](https://www.neimagazine.com/opinion/opinionnuclear-in-france-what-did-they-get-right) , [worldwide it is 93 %](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/what-generation-capacity) on average.

[EU carbon prices hit 60/t](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/carbon). [0.572 kg CO2 are emitted per kWh for gas power plants](https://www.wingas.com/fileadmin/Wingas/WINGAS-Studien/Energieversorgung_und_Energiewende_en.pdf), coal is even much worse. So it costs 0.034  (0.000572 t\* 60 /t = 0.034 ) just to emit the Carbon for gas power.

The existing EDF reactors operate at a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of 0.03  per kWh ([35.15 $ per MWh](https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_51110/projected-costs-of-generating-electricity-2020-edition?details=true) page 59 in the linked pdf). As you can see on page 57 of the linked paper: for coal and gas plants fuel costs and Carbon costs make up more than [50 % of their overall costs](https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_51110/projected-costs-of-generating-electricity-2020-edition?details=true). For nuclear it is less than a third, so operating nuclear at very high capacity makes a lot of economical sense.

Keep in mind that some electricity companies bought co2 certificates for years in advance.

The cherry on the cake: [Germany will close 3 of its 6 remaining nuclear power plants](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/germany.aspx) at the 1st January 2022. So another [5.5 % Germanys electricity production](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economic-Sectors-Enterprises/Energy/Production/_node.html) will be gone. The last 3 nuclear power plants will close till 2023.

bull case:

* With rising CO2 certificate prices EDF nuclear power soon gets cheaper than gas/coal power plants. Whenever France does not need some of its available nuclear capacity, it will export even more power than now. Their current capacity factor is 70 % (93 % is the international average), if they can push that to 85 % during peak demand and sell those for 40 /MWh they can increase their revenue by 3.28 billion dollars, which will mostly be profit since operating and fuel cost are small for nuclear power.  
501.9TWh **electricity output, 76.5% of this nuclear -&gt;** 383.95 TWh nuclear output

383.95 TWh \*15 %(\*100/70) = 82,27 TWh of additional power sold

8,27 \*10\^7 MWh \* 40 /MWh = 3.28 billion dollars

bear cases:

* A very cold + long winter: France mainly relies on electricity for heating, a 1 C drop in temperature means 2.3 GW are needed additionally for heating ([https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-power-supply-idUSL5E8DD87020120214](https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-power-supply-idUSL5E8DD87020120214)). EDF not only owns the power plants, it is also the contracting partner of the individual home owners- prices are fixed their. So when they have to buy a lot of additional power from other energy companies during price peaks, this could lead to losses.
* As a french you mai know Flamanville, as a UK citizen you may know Hinkley Point C. Both nuclear plants are owned by EDF. They are getting [a lot more expensive](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2217725-could-rising-costs-at-hinkley-point-c-end-the-uks-nuclear-ambitions/#ixzz60jO0O0Fx) than anticipated. This is not unusual for new types of power plants, but they need to cut costs on new projects to stay competitive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy4ecz/due_dilligence_of_a_french_nuclear_company/

* The insider buying was done by CEO, CFO, CIO to Directors; so my assumption is that they feel that their shares will increase in value- and they should have some insights on that
* On the other side, it seems that insider ownership, despite recent purchases, remains low overall at only 3.9%. But not everything can be perfect, right? (3)
* I did not really find anything regarding credit ratings for MKTW, perhaps the company is just too small? 
* Worrying to me is the amount of loss generated last year by the company. But projections seem to expect this to improve over the near future. And if the company would be excepted to default because of this, the CEO wouldnt have bought another $150k just a couple of days ago. At least I hope so. 

So all in all, this is what I have looked into so far in regards to this stock, and concluding I will purchase some if it. 

My current Broker (Im from Germany) does not offer these small oversea stocks, so before I can really get startet on this play Ill be opening another securities account at a fitting broker. If you have any recommendations, of course feel free to share. 

As with this strategy it is a first for me- Im planning on only buying a small stake- around 500$. Of course, once my account for this is setup, Ill be updating. 

Perhaps it is also a good idea to have a separate account where I place these kind of semi thought out orders. 

Going forward I plan to look for other companies that fall into this category (maybe 10-20) to diversify a bit more. 

Feel free to let me know what you think and lets see what happens.

Ironically, despite all of the news flow &amp; publication of Covaxin Phase 3 trial data revealing strong efficacy, &amp; EUA granted to Covaxin by Indian government, Ocugen's fortunes are in a similar place to where they were before WHO approval

Earlier this week, Ocugen reported Q3 financials. as the clinical stage biopharma company has no product to sell, I be much eager to glean insights on two subjects : balance sheet &amp; the progress of drug pipeline, specifically in Ocugens case, path forward for its vaccine Covaxin which it has licensed exclusive rights in US &amp; Canada from Bharat Bio

$107m in cash. enough to keep operations going into 2023. 11/18 announces inducement grants for 6 new employees (hmmm)

meanwhile, Ocugen has no shortage of backers &amp; shorts. numerous possibilities in play (I narrow it down)

OCGN &gt; 4,000% in the past year, but has trodden water for several months. what does the future hold for Covaxin in the US &amp; Canada? we have to wait until Health Canada &amp; FDA rule respectively on an EUA (NIH director's tweet  you narrow it down)

https://preview.redd.it/hhuk2dlh5p081.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3d64e82791d96754e740f61058b7bfec370176a

Covaxin  a WHO approved vaccine which has proven to be much more effective than mRNA products which require constant booster shots subscriptions because big dick pharma decided that subscription model yields much higher profits. has benefits that other vaccines do not, such ability to induce a Th1 response, conferring cell-mediated immunity &amp; offering durable &amp; enhanced protection against Delta variants, which is the primary concern at the present time

I think it's possible that US would not object to stockpiling some Covaxin, which has a differentiated mechanism of action, &amp; a shelf life of up to years. to summarise the current state of affairs, I would lean toward an approval in Canada  if Covaxin is good enough for the WHO, why would it not be good enough for Canada? 

Ocugen holds the rights to distribute Covaxin in the US on behalf of Bharat, &amp; a 45% share of all profits. It also has a similar deal in place for Canada, standing to earn 55% of all profits. the study conducted under the IND, will help demonstrate that the data from India will be applicable to the US population. Ocugen has already sought regulatory approval from Health Canada for Covaxin to be used in that country

Ramakanth senses theres an opportunity for the vaccine to make its mark &amp; apparently Im convicted too 

[Position](https://preview.redd.it/ioetkfui5p081.jpg?width=754&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ded5c9b067681d4165d6b90897d17d223e7d61b)

BB can't fill &amp; hasn't filled the orders in their 1.3b population of India. they are behind &amp; that was before India approved Covaxin for 2-9 year olds (before) WHO approval, had orders from over 15 countries, mounting close to 1b orders unfilled. uses the platform of Polio vaccines i.e. proven the safest

Ocugen will rip over highs (again) once orders start pouring in

Ocugen announced EUA for Covaxin for pediatric patients 2-18 yrs old, supported by a Phase 2/3 pediatric study in India. results from the study of 526 children display similar outcome to Phase 3 study (in adult study, Covaxin showed 77.8% efficacy &amp; 93.4% efficacy rate against severe disease

there has been a spurt in global interest in Covaxin for pediatric use. clinical data from 2-18 age group has also been well received by several countries. only Covaxin has such data in Covid vaccines for such age group. several countries are now mulling import of Covaxin for their paediatric populations

the neutralizing antibody responses against wild-type strain in the pediatric age group of 2-18 years were equivalent to those seen in adults, ages 18+ years, in Bharat Biotechs large Phase 3 efficacy &amp; safety trial. the inactivated virus platform has been used for decades in vaccines for the pediatric population

meanwhile, Ocugen entered into an agreement with CanSino over gene therapy product candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration 

now, did you want to talk about Ocugen healing the many mutations that cause blindness all at once on the Harvard platform? hell nay, these hit writers for the bears don't tell you about that. yep, it's going to human trials now to heal the blind, meaning they can probably start selling for healing blind animals now &amp; if successful in human trials, this is the next potential $50b company

to this end, the 5-star H.C. Wainwright analyst has a Buy rating for $OCGN shares, backed by a $10 price target. I see $18 on first revenue source

Ocugen is guilty of many parabolic moves. 4000% gains got praise from analysts who have watched as the under-the-radar biotech company focusing on developing gene therapies targeting eye disease partnered with Bharat Biotech that had already won authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin in India. Bharat wanted a partner to help get Covaxin into the U.S. market. It picked Ocugen

lolz at mms using dark pool to buy &amp; the market to sell into retail thinking they smart using ladder attacks &amp; give illusion of a steep sell off. with on chain data easy to tell they accumulating whole time some news comes out. buy the rumor sell the news. they want you to once again sit out the next 12 months like you did the last 12 months missing out on 4000% gains. do your own DD &amp; don't listen to bearish hit writers trying to get retailers to sell so tutes can buy them out

upcoming  Canada day, betches. It's going to be a glorious weekend. a former monster showing strength again on volume spikes. uptrending into an ascending wedge that could squeeze through the $15 level on one revenue source

prepare for fire works. BB will announce orders, Ocugen will produce 50% of those orders. Canada &amp; US still in play. hodl or watch for dip entrance or next volume resistance break on hourly chart. start out 1/4 of your position &amp; have fun making money. easy doubler. wouldn't be a first",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxzvdl/g_spot_ocgn_back_in_play_canada_day_mkt_cap_15b/

OCGN &gt; 4,000% in the past year, but has trodden water for several months. what does the future hold for Covaxin in the US &amp; Canada? we have to wait until Health Canada &amp; FDA rule respectively on an EUA (NIH director's tweet helps you narrow it down)

Covaxin  a WHO approved vaccine which has proven to be much more effective than mRNA products which require constant booster shots subscriptions because big dick pharma decided that subscription model yields much higher profits. has benefits that other vaccines do not, such ability to induce a Th1 response, conferring cell-mediated immunity &amp; offering durable &amp; enhanced protection against Delta variants, which is the primary concern at the present time

I think it's possible that US would not object to stockpiling some Covaxin, which has a differentiated mechanism of action, &amp; a shelf life of up to years. to summarise the current state of affairs, I would lean toward an approval in Canada  if Covaxin is good enough for the WHO, why would it not be good enough for Canada? 

Ocugen holds the rights to distribute Covaxin in the US on behalf of Bharat, &amp; a 45% share of all profits. It also has a similar deal in place for Canada, standing to earn 55% of all profits. the study conducted under the IND, will help demonstrate that the data from India will be applicable to the US population. Ocugen has already sought regulatory approval from Health Canada for Covaxin to be used in that country

Ramakanth senses theres an opportunity for the vaccine to make its mark &amp; apparently Im convicted too

BB can't fill &amp; hasn't filled the orders in their 1.3b population of India. they are behind &amp; that was before India approved Covaxin for 2-9 year olds (before) WHO approval, had orders from over 15 countries, mounting close to 1b orders unfilled. uses the platform of Polio vaccines i.e. proven the safest. Ocugen will rip over highs (again) once orders start pouring in

Ocugen announced EUA for Covaxin for pediatric patients 2-18 yrs old, supported by a Phase 2/3 pediatric study in India. results from the study of 526 children display similar outcome to Phase 3 study (in adult study, Covaxin showed 77.8% efficacy &amp; 93.4% efficacy rate against severe disease

there has been a spurt in global interest in Covaxin for pediatric use. clinical data from 2-18 age group has also been well received by several countries. only Covaxin has such data in Covid vaccines for such age group. several countries are now mulling import of Covaxin for their paediatric populations

the neutralizing antibody responses against wild-type strain in the pediatric age group of 2-18 years were equivalent to those seen in adults, ages 18+ years, in Bharat Biotechs large Phase 3 efficacy &amp; safety trial. the inactivated virus platform has been used for decades in vaccines for the pediatric population

meanwhile, Ocugen entered into an agreement with CanSino over gene therapy product candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration 

now, did you want to talk about Ocugen healing the many mutations that cause blindness all at once on the Harvard platform? hell nay, these hit writers for the bears don't tell you about that. yep, it's going to human trials now to heal the blind, meaning they can probably start selling for healing blind animals now &amp; if successful in human trials, this is the next potential $50b company

To this end, the 5-star H.C. Wainwright analyst has a Buy rating for $OCGN shares, backed by a $10 price target. I see $18 on first revenue source

Ocugen is guilty of many parabolic moves. 4000% gains got praise from analysts who have watched as the under-the-radar biotech company focusing on developing gene therapies targeting eye disease partnered with Bharat Biotech that had already won authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin in India. Bharat wanted a partner to help get Covaxin into the U.S. market. It picked Ocugen

lolz at mms using dark pool to buy &amp; the market to sell into retail thinking they smart using ladder attacks &amp; give illusion of a steep sell off. with on chain data easy to tell they accumulating whole time some news comes out. buy the rumor sell the news. they want you to once again sit out the next 12 months like you did the last 12 months missing out on 4000% gains. do your own DD &amp; don't listen to bearish hit writers trying to get retailers to sell so tutes can buy them out

upcoming  Canada day, betches. It's going to be a glorious weekend. a former monster showing strength again on volume spikes. uptrending into an ascending wedge that could squeeze through the $15 level on one revenue source

logistics automation is getting momo. had a feeling warehouse robotics would be the next sector to pop &amp; BGRY is the undervalued protagonist I've been waiting on with lots of range

BGRY seems ready to scale &amp; thrive in a large &amp; continuously growing global target market that is making the first steps towards full automation

BGRY develops systems that use AI, mobile robots &amp; scanning, gripping &amp; sensing technology to pick orders &amp; speed goods through distribution centers that once relied largely on human labor are turning to automation as the pandemic &amp; social-distancing requirements have made it harder to boost output by simply hiring more workers. e-commerce is exploding

Berkshire went public through a SPAC deal co-founded with AOL co-founder Steve Case. top tier investors &amp; partners : Khosla, New Enterprise, Canaan, SoftBank, PIPE anchored by Chamath Palihapitiya, BlackRock. Fortune 100 customers : Walmart, FedEx, Target, TJX, Meijer, &amp; SoftBank

of course early signs of a sector leader in the making

automation is becoming mission critical for the supply chain whether in retail, e-commerce, grocery, package handling or delivery. considering accelerating growth of e-commerce &amp; ongoing reshaping of logistics, Berkshire meets increasing demand in robotic systems for production lines, warehouses, &amp; distro centers

global supply chain bottlenecks, labor shortages &amp; higher wage demands in the US make it clearer

BGRY Q3 revenue of $18.8m, a 750% increase from Q3 of 2020 &amp; 317% from Q2 of 2021. a large TAM &amp; sector potential constitute a large pool for future revenue. total orders since inception of $184 million. $70 million in new orders in 2021 YTD. solid liquidity position, end Q3 $203m cash &amp; no debt

BGRY announced that it recently secured new orders of $36m representing $25 million in repeat orders from a blue-chip anchor customer &amp; $11 million from new customers

BGRY chart set to breakout. the $25 million order represents yet another follow-on order for tens of solutions to be installed in different locations, with many more locations anticipated for future orders obviously which could be the catalyst that sends this

BGRY crushed the bottom off this reversal. broke a downtrend with a MACD crossover. attention will be next week

This past year, Gamestop has really made a push to move retail online, and this holiday season we will see the outcomes of this. Plus, with Covid, gaming is more popular than ever, so this market is a major one. 

 

**There are several criteria for selling items online:**

**Customer Service:** Often missed as a factor, customer service is actually one of the most important things when buying online. Many times, when unable to see the product physically, there is confusion on the buyer's part on what you are getting, the specifications of the product itself, not getting what you want, and so on. Having friendly, knowledgeable customer service can be a huge factor in customer loyalty, reviews, and the customer decides to buy the product.

**Prices:** For obvious reasons prices are the major factor. After all who would buy something more expensive when it's the same product? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Availability:** As many buy gifts during the season, there is bound to be a shortage of something. The question is, which company will be better prepared for it? Having the reputation of rarely having a product out of stock is a huge boost of customer loyalty and satisfaction. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Winners:**

**Customer Service**: Upon research and experience, definitely **Gamestop.** The customer service people at GameStop were much more knowledgeable of the products and what you could expect to get. The friendliness of the two was about the same, both were good, but one did not seem much better than the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Prices: Gamestop.** In general, the prices were lower although only by a few dollars. Keep in mind though, these are the pre-sale prices, so this may not be entirely accurate. 

**Availability: Tie.** This was really hard to tell, but I think in general they were about the same. Amazon has a bit of an upper hand, as they are a bigger company with more supply chains and such, but we will see more as the holiday season progresses. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Moral of the Story:** GME has the potential to beat Amazon this holiday season.

Am I the only one thinking here things are going a little bit too far??
There is nothing to justify such a massive market cap. Not even this new thing of metaverse, that indeed is not a trademark and most of big players out there are going to pursue (Facebook in primis; but I suppose google and Amazon will not stay behind).
But lets make some comparison among other big players; intel, market cap 201B, P/E 9,6 (yes 9,6 not 96) and revenue 78B. AMD, market cap 187, P\E 48 and revenue 14,8 B.
nvidia Numbers cannot be even compared with competitors, are far out of any logic. Nasdaq is going to the moon only by a few companies (fanng) while all others are left behind growth stocks heavily hammered and these beasts brought to unreasonable heights.
And between fanng nvdia remain the worst one; looking numbers.
I may sound stupid but here i see a massive bubble that will have to burst. I made a kamikaze move but I decided to short nvdia.

# Streaming

The number of entertainment companies owned by Disney is crazy.  A few of the biggest names include ABC, ESPN (80% stake), Hulu (60% stake), Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. Blah, Blah, Blah. This is well known. The stock price has plummeted after the most recent earnings report largely because subscription growth has slowed down for Disney+. Of course it did. All the disney fanatics signed up when it first launched. Disney+ has approximately half the number of subscribers that Netflix has. Netflix has a market cap of $300B. Disney's market cap currently sits around $280B. How the fuck anyone values Netflix above the entire Disney empire is beyond me. Regardless, Disney has been working hard to show their recent investments in the streaming space was worthwhile and that they have the ability to attract new subscribers. CEO, Bob Chapek, has expressed great interest in attracting adult subscribers to Disney+ with more mature content, co-releasing new movies in theatres as well as on Disney+,  and their Hulu Live TV service. The Hulu Live TV service has 39 million subscribers, all of which are soon to be automatically subscribed to Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a small price increase. This number is significantly larger than the 2 million subscribers that Disney+ gained in the most recent quarter. Some of the boomer channels owned and available on Hulu Live TV are shown below.

[Only boomers still watch cable, but they pay a lot for those channels and all that shit is on Hulu Live TV.](https://preview.redd.it/bctibgswrn081.png?width=2536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6a7b3b9eabc905ef9d19fc13c6d8897f50d0b7f)

# Parks and Products

Theme park revenue from 2020 to 2021 increased &gt;100% within the US and 46% internationally. Not surprising as parks reopen after covid lockdowns. Parks are now fully operational and lockdowns are not coming back so this uptrend in revenue should continue. Revenue from consumer products has the biggest potential to rise here as it is only up 3% from 2020 to 2021. Toy sales usually coincide with new movie releases and those have been lacking until recently. Kids love toys and I even know a few adults that would love one of those new badass lightsabers for Christmas. The holidays, along with new releases, are going to boost product sales over the next few months.

# Sports Betting

With Disney owning ESPN and the sports betting market growing so fast, it only makes sense for them to be a major player.  Bob Chapek states in the most recent earnings call that Given our reach and scale, we have the potential to partner with third parties in this space in a very meaningful way. They even bought up shares of DraftKings, whos market cap sits around $16 Billion. Hard to say which 3rd party will end up partnering with Disney/ESPN or when they will enter the sports betting market, but it will happen sooner than later.

# Summary and Position

Disney will bounce like the ass of a stripper who is late on rent.  Their dominant position in streaming and entertainment, theme parks reopening, holiday sales, and potentially entering into sports betting gives a conservative market cap of $350 billion. Pending a market crash, I expect Disneys share price to hit $190 near their Q1 2022 earnings report. My position :

I was just looking at the 3 month chart since IPO and thinking wtf..  all this stock is doing is going down.

If so let me present you with a novel idea.  An actual awesome company that is both innovative and disruptive.  Its 36% off its 52 week high.  It has a short interest of 40% according to TD.  It has a analysts target price in the low 40s and its currently trading for 32.50.

Without further ado I present you with FIGS.  What is figs you ask?  Well you know how about a fifth of our economy is in the medical field.  And you know how they've all been wearing the same ugly, baggy, communist looking garbage for decades.  Well figs is currently disrupting the 80 billion dollar global industry that provides scrubs.  They make slim fitting, stylish scrubs, in an array of colors.  

The TAM is enormous for this company.   The beauty is that the medical field is full of young professionals that make decent money.  A good portion are single and looking.  If given the choice they'd like to look attractive at work.  And as their counterparts workers start wearing them the bar will be raised.  No way Becky wants to look like a frumpy turd next to Kelly and let her bag the surgeon.

The brand is strong.  Margins are over 70%.  They recently crushed earnings.  Beat and raised guidance.  


The play is simple.  Buy a shitload of shares.  This thing can move fast.  Last week it randomly shot up 20%.  It then sold off after it crushed earnings.  Imo alot of people bought in high in upper 40s and are harvesting their losses for tax season.  

With the high short interest this thing could move very quickly.  Shorts have squeezed most of the juice out of it and will likely start to unwind.  If it jumps quick then great take profits if you want.   If it doesn't you can rest assured that it'll be up at some point.  I think this could be the next lulu lemon.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021.

# **Stocks may be entering an optimal period in the Thanksgiving holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/stocks-may-be-entering-an-optimal-period-in-the-thanksgiving-holiday-week.html)**
*****
&gt; If history is a guide, the market should do well in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher in the past week, buoyed by positive economic reports, particularly the unexpectedly strong 1.7% jump in Octobers retail sales. There are a number of economic reports in the week ahead. The most important release is Wednesdays personal consumption expenditures, which includes the inflation measure most watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; The last five trading days of November are traditionally positive, since 1950, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Theres a two-thirds likelihood the market is up on the day before Thanksgiving and a 57% likelihood the day after Thanksgiving, and a 71% likelihood that its up on Monday.
*****
&gt; This year that holiday rally could depend on whether Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues in his role after his term expires in February. Biden has also interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is supported by progressive Democrats.
*****
&gt; Strategists expect market volatility around the appointment, particularly if it is Brainard. She is viewed as more dovish than Powell, meaning she may be slower to raise interest rates. Elevated levels of inflation have been a concern in the market, and the worry is Brainard would not be as aggressive fighting it with rate hikes if necessary.
*****
&gt; Barring a change at the helm of the Fed, I think the market trajectory is going to continue to be higher, as we move toward 2022, said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist with ClearBridge Investments. Given that Brainard is even more dovish than Powell, I think markets would recover very quickly... the markets are unsure whether the new Fed chairman could command consensus within the FOMC to effectively deliver policy, he added.
*****
&gt; Schulze said the economic momentum is improving, and he expects that fourth-quarter gross domestic product could be in the double digits after the disappointing 2% pace of the third quarter. The second reading for the third-quarter GDP is released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; In the past week, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index also showed solid, better-than-expected activity in the mid-Atlantic region. It really confirms the view that despite supply side constraints, the recovery is on track after the Covid-related slowdown in Q3, Schulze said. I think the markets are going to price in better earnings as we move into fourth-quarter earnings and 2022.
*****
&gt; But Stovall said the market may take a pause before it moves higher, and he expects a choppy period. The S&amp;P 500 gains on average 7.2% between its October low and the end of the year. But by early November, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 9% from its low, and was overbought, he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall also said the market could become concerned again about the spread of Covid in Europe and beyond. Due to a high rate of new cases, the government of Austria announced a three-week lockdown and a vaccine mandate.
*****
&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the Austrian news Friday, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained. Stocks were mixed for the week, with the Dow down 1.4% and the Nasdaq up 1.2%, lifted by tech stock gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% for the week, ending at 4,697.
*****
&gt; There is still upside potential. The worry about inflation and now Covid are reasons for the overbought condition to work itself through, he said. Stovall added the market could move sideways to lower for awhile, but it should end the year higher. But right now, theres a bit of choppiness because of Covid, because of the Fed chair possibly being replaced the worry about inflation and now and a whole variety of things, he said.
*****
&gt; For investors who watch the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, Wells Fargo bond strategists point out that long-term Treasury yields generally move lower on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.
*****
&gt; Our take is straightforward, and is essentially the same rationale as for moves around Labor Day: risk appetite is low on both the buy and sell sides, they said. But later in the week, starting Wednesday, the yield tends to rise.

&gt; # Tech is Leading Again

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector has gained 27% in the past six months, outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 by more than 10%. But could its run of leadership just be getting started? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the sector just broke out to fresh relative highs for the first time since September 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 14 months without a new relative high may not sound like a lot, but that actually represented the longest streak of underperformance for the tech sector since a more than 3-year run that ended in 2015. And while the sectors breakout does not mean that it will automatically go on another run of multiyear outperformance, we do believe context is important and that investors should recognize that just because technology has had a strong run recently, over the past 14 months the sector has performed just in line with the broader market. We would also note that these are not all-time relative highs for the sector, as it still sits below its early-2000 peak.

&gt; The theme of 2021 has been rotation, rotation, rotation, said LPL Financial Technical Strategist Scott Brown. But technology is the only sector to recently hit a 52-week relative high and we believe that sets up a favorable outlook heading into 2022.

&gt; From a fundamental perspective, technology continues to be a key enabler of higher productivity and home to many of the fastest growing companies. Despite topping all sectors with 9% earnings growth in 2020, earnings growth this year is on track to exceed 30%.

&gt; So does this mean investors should be shifting all of their assets over to growth stocks again? We dont necessarily think so, and continue to find opportunities in both growth and value styles. In our proprietary sector trend rankings, technology comes in at #2, trailing only energy and just ahead of financials, both of which sit firmly in the value style and have benefitted from the continued reopening and above trend economic growth. We believe quality growth and more cyclical value companies can both do well in the current environment and remain most negative on defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities that have traditionally underperformed during early-to-middle stages of the business cycle.

&gt; # Sentiment Back to Average

&gt; The past week has seen the S&amp;P 500 hover right below but not at record highs. The lack of new highs in price appears to have left individual investors apprehensive as bullish sentiment in the AAII survey pulled back 9.2 percentage points to 38.8%. That was the biggest one-week drop since a 16.5 percentage point decline in the week of September 16th, though back then, bullish sentiment sat much lower at 22.4%. At the current level, bullish sentiment is still within one percentage point of the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bull.png))**



&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a sharp reversal lower, bearish sentiment rose modestly to 27.2%. That is the highest level since the end of October and that remains roughly 3 percentage points below the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those inverse moves resulted in the bull-bear spread falling to 11.6. While lower, that still indicates overall sentiment favors optimists.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; A greater share of the losses to bullish sentiment shifted to the neutral camp with around a third of respondents reporting as such. That is the highest level since the first week of October. That reading is a few percentage points above the historical average meaning that like bullish and bearish sentiment, current survey readings do not indicate sentiment is elevated or depressed to any sort of notable extent.

&gt; # 2021 Now Has The Second Most New Highs Ever

&gt; The incredible bull run of 2021 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index only 0.02% away from the 66th all-time high this calendar year, tied with (for now) the 65 set in 1964 and behind only the record 77 set in 1995. Weve run out of superlatives to describe what weve seen so far this year, so well keep it very simple. Years like this dont happen very often, so lets remember to enjoy it, explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 66 new highs this year would be second only to 1995. With about six weeks to go this year, 2021 is on pace to just barely miss setting a new record of new highs, but they say you wont hit the pitches you dont swing at and 2021 still has a lot of swings left, so anything is possible.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As we noted at the start of the month, November has been the best month of the year for stocks and it has been quite strong yet again this year. But be aware that November is historically rather strong early and late, while the middle can be choppy. Suggesting new highs could be a little tough to come by in the near-term, at least until we all get our fill of Turkey next week.

&gt; Additionally, post-election years can get quite choppy from now until late in December. After the run weve had lately, maybe some sideways chop is necessary, but we see further gains ahead through year-end.

&gt; # Small and Mid Caps Gain Ground

&gt; Equities broadly have been in rally mode so far this quarter, but in the month of November smaller market caps have generally outperformed. Month to date, the small-cap S&amp;P 600 ETF (IJR) has gained 5.88% as of this morning while the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 ETF (IJH) has risen 4.21%. Large caps as proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY), meanwhile, are up less than 2% MTD. While there is plenty of time left in the month for things to change, the spread between the month-to-date performance of small and mid-caps versus large caps is on pace to be on the wider side of all months of the past twenty years. As shown in the charts below, IJR is currently outperforming SPY MTD by 4.05 percentage points, and that reading is 2.37 percentage points for IJH versus SPY. Those rank in the 91st and 86th percentiles, respectively, of all months of the past twenty years. That also marks the first month with significant outperformance of smaller market caps relative to large caps since the stretch of large-cap underperformance that ran from the fall of last year through this past February. Prior to that, you would have to go back to March 2018 to find the last time that small and mid-caps both outperformed large caps by as much as they are this month.

1,"11/20/2021, 08:18:00",Let's talk about PFOF,ShortChecker,"So, I got this screenshot below from a Redditor on a different subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dwc33upsxm081.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84b21b70e3f3a20fa0f90b21d2a6b3fd9d5d38fe

Before GME and AMC and all retail investing really started to ramp up, the concept of PFOF was not so widely understood and even really mattered to the average investor.

Overtime, those smooth brains who have been speaking out against it raised some really great points.

PFOF (Payment for order flow) is a tool or system to essentially control and make money through micro transactions through their control of their customers order flow. It's a contributor to the market and helps the market makers who use it to profit from their clients investments and make bank through it all. This also means that when you buy a stock on an app like RobinHood, you do not actually own the stock. That stock could vary well be (and it is) not purchased (owned by you, as in registered to your name). This is an unreasonable risk for no reason other then to generate more cash flow for market makers. The orders come through from the company (Robinhood) and go through a market makers clearing house. At this point, these market makers remain in control of an order and makes money through micro trades and exchanges. This would mean that if you wanted to, right then and there, request an issued stock certificate, you can't as the brokerage (Robinhood and whoever else uses PFOF as a business model), don't actually have possession of your shares. This can cause a myriad of issues such as buying/selling, exchanging or switching to another broker, etc, etc.

The argument most people in support of PFOF are arguing that, no, because of PFOF, this is the reason why people can trade so easily and for cheap (free, no fees). Okay sure, but this comes with a major cost, much more than what's mentioned above, of course. But the thing is, this hasn't changed trading, like it did a bit by introducing the market to a slew of people, but even at that, the fees for most brokerages who don't use PFOF are pretty low. I can't see how this would be such a critical counter point for the benefit of the ""market"". So, personally, I don't understand that aspect.

Lastly, the whole reason for this post, is after seeing that redditors screenshot, it demonstrates why PFOF is so bad. 

Look at what was written from the courts, ""The request from a market maker to limit order flow sent to it is not equivalent to a demand to restrict trading.""

So, thats the loophole for using brokerages who's business models are PFOF. In cases, although rare, but have actually occurred, these people can get away with restricting trading for none SEC, or Regulatory bases, and capitalize on their control of order flow to cover losses and/or make profit, and yet will not face any legal repercussions from their actions. Reason being, because ""apparently"" the law states that it doesn't consider restricting trades made through the use of PFOF as a form of restricting trading.

Take that in.

On a general note, I do think this is important to know and be aware of.

This means, that if you buy a stock with a brokerage that uses PFOF, you could very well be prevented or stopped from either wanting to get into a position, or maybe even getting out of a position. On top of that, the brokerage + market makers can avoid legal repercussions. Thats risky af man.

Know where your money is sleeping when it's not in your pockets.

I'm not here to pretend like I'm some guru in the understandings of PFOF system. But, this is an actual legal outcome and result from brokerages and market makers restricting trading.

2) HPV VGX 3100 Phase 3 completed and  it's effective...potentially a product in the market in 2022

3) INO 5401 - GBM Phase 1 Trial has been going real well based what has been shared thus far....INO might kick this cancers' ass and that alone is a reason enough to contribute to this great company....

1,"11/20/2021, 07:43:08",$BGFV DD: Short Squeeze Piece?,jdon4424,"Calling all retards, degenerates, and artists: Today, I present to you a great opportunity.

I reckon that I have found a BIG(ly) undervalued stock. That stock? $BGFV. Big 5 Sporting Goods sells shit. And lots of it. They have 434 stores across the United States. The only downside to Big 5 is that their interior design is fucking dogshit. And their ads fucking suck. They look like they're trying to sell to 75 year old grandparents who are not a huge fan of other races. 

https://preview.redd.it/rqkf4en6xm081.jpg?width=764&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0912dde938c27ed4ff6cb4cfe71235a5981025d6

But enough about how much they suck at design. Let's talk about the fucking money.

I first came across Big 5 (also my name for my penis but even that is generous) on Trading View. I was looking for some deep fucking value. I usually like to us a combination of various aspects to value a company, but mainly EV/EBITDA and P/E ratios. Both a low EV/EBITDA and a low P/E ratio are signs that a company is undervalued.  In the retail trading sector, Big 5 has the second lowest EV/EBTIDA ratio and the 9th lowest P/E ratio. For those who don't know EV/EBITDA and P/E ratios  Seeing this turned me on. Upon further research, I also found out that Big 5 is the SECOND most shorted stock with a short interest percentage of 39.6%. This puppy is ripe for a short squeeze. 

&amp;#x200B;

[$BGFV chart the last month](https://preview.redd.it/u2xh1f2ozm081.png?width=1794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97ccb1460835f7d8916be93a8e921c3074f2f6b8)

While Big 5 has certainly been volatile, it's recent miss of earnings could cause short interest to increase. Even after its large spike, short interest is still super high. However, you're probably asking yourself, ""Why is this stock in the shitter right now?"" Well, Big 5 had a special dividend of 1$ per share w/ an ex-dividend date of November 17th. Additionally, supply chain issues along with October being a  historically poor month for the retail trading sector played a huge impact on Big 5 missing earnings. However, you know what time it is? It's the Holiday season motherfuckers. And you know what people do during the Holidays? They spend. A fuck ton. Plus, retail sales outlook for the holidays looks spectacular right now. So, Big 5 is dipping right now, but their sales are about to heavily increase. BTDF. BTDF. BTDF. 

I want to say that GME has fucked everyone's ideas about short squeezes. It is highly unlikely we ever see a short squeeze to the likes of GME again. However, short squeezes still happen. Yet, even if Big 5 does not experience a short squeeze, I believe it is INCREDIBLY undervalued, especially given that holiday season is upon us. Do with this information as you will, but I believe at minimum, we have a stock that will grow with the possibly of skyrocketing. Let's fucking ride Big 5 (yes, I'm talking about my dick, too. Someone ride it. Please).",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxsmds/bgfv_dd_short_squeeze_piece/

But despite that, I hate any sort of small loss.  How do you take a 20% loss and hold on for the recovery?  

I'm holding 5 month till expiration SPY calls at the moment.  Things were ok this morning but took a shit around lunch and I ended up a few hundred down at close (around 1 or 2 percent).  I know it's only 1 or 2 percent and that SPY will recover in the long run but damn it puts me in a bit of a downer mood knowing that I lost a few hundred.  I'm not rich by any means.  A few hundred bucks is 2 or 3 days work for me.  

How do you diamond hands through this bullshit like it's nothing?  Do you just pretend it's all monopoly money?  Or that it's just gone the moment you put it into your account and it's all house money you're playing with?  Shit is wild.

1,"11/20/2021, 04:56:28",Why Nano Dimension is not a whatever bagger,DB3TK,"This week, I attended the \[Productronica\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productronica)) trade fair in Munich, Germany. Among others, I was at the booth of \[Nano Dimension\]([https://www.nano-di.com/](https://www.nano-di.com/)) (NNDM), had a look at their Dragonfly IV printer and talked to some of the booth staffers.

So this is what you can do with the Dragonfly IV, based on what I already knew from their website and what they told me:

It can print 3D objects in a build volume of  160 mm x 160 mm x 3 mm, using two different inks in an ink jet process - the inks, specially developed for this printer, are jetted layer by layer onto the print bed and each layer is cured with UV and infrared light. One of the inks is nonconductive, and the other one is conductive due to its content of silver nanoparticles. In its cured form, its conductivity is about 30% of the conductivity of copper. With modified printing parameters (with their own drawbacks, of course), this could be improved to 80%. Two staffers with whom I talked contradicted each other about the solderability of the conductors. One said that you should use \[vapour phase soldering\]([https://www.totalmateria.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=ktn&amp;LN=EN&amp;NM=449](https://www.totalmateria.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=ktn&amp;LN=EN&amp;NM=449)) with special low temperature solder, while the other one said that it is also possible to use hand soldering with lower temperature than usual.

The print resolution is  18 m (x), 18 m (y), 10 m (z). Printing an object that fills the whole available build volume takes 24 hours.

The price of a Dragonfly IV is $400.000.

I also ran across the booth of \[Essemtec\]([https://essemtec.com/en/](https://essemtec.com/en/)\], a maker of, among others, \[pick-and-place machines\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick-and-place\_machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick-and-place_machine)). A poster with the Nano Dimension logo, pasted onto their booth sign seemingly as an afterthought. I asked one of the staffers about it and he told me that \[Nano Dimension had recently acquired Essemtec\]([https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/03/2326485/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Acquires-Essemtec-AG-Surface-Mount-Pick-Place-Systems-Supplier-for-the-PCB-and-OEM-Industries.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/03/2326485/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Acquires-Essemtec-AG-Surface-Mount-Pick-Place-Systems-Supplier-for-the-PCB-and-OEM-Industries.html)). Nano Dimension's plan is to integrate the Dragonfly printer with a pick and place machine, i.e. the printer and the p&amp;p machine would be placed side by side with a facility to transfer the workpiece back and forth between the machines, possibly multiple times, to embed components in several layers within the workpiece. Essemtec is also supposed to assist Nano Dimension in improving their printer. Paraphrasing the Essemtec staffer: ""Nano Dimension's idea is great, but their implementation... well... there is much room for improvement"".

I found another interesting company at the trade fair: \[ioTech\]([https://i-o-tech.com/](https://i-o-tech.com/)). They offer a different electronics 3D printer. It uses a process called laserjetting: A tape of a special plastic film is pulled through a coating device, which spreads the material whith wich you want to print in a thin layer onto the tape. The tape travels on, over the print bed, with a narrow gap between the print bed, resp. the previously printed layer and the coated side of the tape. Then, short strong laser pulses are fired onto the other side of the tape. On a very small spot on the tape, this boils off a small part of the coating material and the vapour propels the material above it away from the tape towards the print bed. After a complete layer of printing materials has been deposited on the print bed resp. the previous layer, it is cured or dried by UV, infrared, hot air or whatever is necessary for the particular materials. The used tapes can be cleaned and reused. There is a \[paper about laser jetting\]([https://www.nature.com/articles/srep17265#auth-M\_-Zenou](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep17265#auth-M_-Zenou)), co-authored by none other than Michael Zenou, ioTech's CTO.

This works with any material which is liquid or pasteous, as long as you can spread it onto the plastic tape. Instead of the conductive and nonconductive inks used by Nano Dimension, you would use a nano copper ink made by Henkel (AFAIK not made specifically for ioTech but an off the shelf product) and single component epoxy (also off the shelf).

The mostly material agnostic process used by ioTech has many more advantages: On top of the printed PCB or 3D workpiece, you can print solder mask, silkscreen and solder paste (you do not need the fancy low temperature type) like on a standard PCB. Then, take the PCB out of the printer for pick&amp;place and reflow. You want to 3D print something out of silicone, or any sort of resin, you also want to add paint, glue or coating to that printed piece - all this is possible with the ioTech machine. No way to do that with Nano Dimension's inkjet process.

They started to cooperate with ASM SMT, a subsidy of  ASM Pacific Technology  to integrate their printer with ASM pick &amp; place machines. ioTech did also receive funding from ASM Pacific Technologies and Henkel. 

The resolution of the ioTech printer is 20 m, slightly worse than Nano Dimension's 18m. ioTech's build volume is much bigger than that of the NNDM Dragonfy IV, though I do not remember the exact numbers, but the print bed of ioTech is about twice as deep as that of NNDM and more than twice as wide.

The print speed: several minutes for a PCB, not 24 hours.

The price: about $ 300.000, three quarters of the Nano Dimension Dragonfly IV.

When I talked to Michael Zenou at the ioTech booth (I found out only afterwards that he is the CTO and one of the founders) I mentioned that Nano Dimension is the much more widely known of the two companies and that I got interested in them because of stocks. He acknowledged that at least in public relations, Nano Dimension has a clear advantage, and that he would wish ioTech were better funded. Me: ""So, ioTech has the ideas, but Nano Dimension has the money?"" Michael Zenou: ""LOL, yes.""

Anyway, ioTech is better known now, after having been at Productronica, and \[winning two prizes there\]([http://smttoday.com/2021/11/16/double-coveted-award-win-for-iotech-at-productronica/](http://smttoday.com/2021/11/16/double-coveted-award-win-for-iotech-at-productronica/)): The first prize of the \[productronica Fast Forward Award\]([https://www.elektormagazine.com/news/productronica-fast-forward-award-2021-winners](https://www.elektormagazine.com/news/productronica-fast-forward-award-2021-winners)) and the \[productronica Innovation Award\]([https://www.productronica.com/en/press/newsroom/press-releases/detail/the-winners-have-been-chosen.php](https://www.productronica.com/en/press/newsroom/press-releases/detail/the-winners-have-been-chosen.php)) in the PCB &amp; EMS category. The trade press 

You might have noticed that the NNDM stock price got clobbered in the recent days, including an 8% drop on Thursday, while the Productronica ran from Tuesday to Friday. I guess this is not pure coincidence. If I had not already sold all my NNDM stocks long ago, I would certainly have sold them right after returning from the trade fair.

Smaller player, but thats going to allow them more upside for growth. They recently acquired GT Advanced Technologies for their silicon carbide production, and are planning investments in expanding current capacity.

Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiN) are the next generation of materials in power components, youve probably already seen them in consumer mobile quick chargers.  

GaN has better electron mobility, advantageous for high frequency applications.  But SiC has better thermal conductivity and defect yields, making it suitable for high power, high temperature use cases (like EV).

TCG World introduces a new approach to NFTs, making it more than just a piece of art - now players can take their NFTs into the virtual game world and play. Everything a player owns in the metaverse is an NFT - real estate, vehicles, pets, trophies, and even player avatars. As part of the entertainment, TCG World will also host live collectible card game tournaments at the TCG World Stadium. 

*Processing video j3iol5090m081...*

While exploring TCG World, a player will find a lot of different kinds of creatures powered by artificial intelligence algorithms. One of the characteristics of these creatures is called evolution level. Creatures found in the wild as a common rule have the first level. Creatures are tameable and once caught can be relocated to a players plot land.

Players will be able to evolve, train and trade creatures. Players will also be able to fight with their creatures against other players in various small arenas spread out across the map, and at the main TCG Arena.

TCG Worlds native currency is TCGCoin 2.0. TCGCoin 2.0 offers cross-chain transfer, which enables users to move the value of tokens between smart contracts on different blockchains, by a simple in-built TCG finance ecosystem cross-chain exchange, through the main wallets of the TCG project on different chains, at a rate of 1 token on one blockchain into 1 token on another blockchain.

TCG World will be a living and breathing virtual world filled with real people and activities bringing the real world and the virtual metaverse world together, using the play-to-earn approach system. TCG World has its own story which will progress as a player spends more time in the game.

Now for some real ANALysis.

1) $OPEN's business is a structurally flawed highly leveraged hedge fund.

Open door takes capital, buys assets, and attempts to resell at a profit. Ignoring whether their skill at selling at a profit or not, they do NOT have enough capital on hand to actually buy these houses for cash, so they take on mortgages. What's worse, they take on SHORT TERM mortgages. As of Q3 $4B out of $5.3B of mortgage debt (backing $6.3B of real estate inventory) is due within one year. Why? To lower holding costs. But this exposes them to a huge asset/liability mix match. You can't just ""sit out"" a temporary market dip. Remember Bill Hwang? If housing dips in the short term $OPEN have NO CHOICE but to liquidate at a huge loss. Which brings me to the next point.

2) $OPEN loves to talk about ""contribution profit"", but the reality is that they only book profits when it is convenient. 

Real estate inventory is NOT marked to market, so as long as they don't sell the shit houses, they don't report contribution losses. This is the reason why Zillow took a huge writedown when they wound down iBuying. This is literally it's not loss until you sell meme, but in real life, practiced by a $13B company. Now pretend you are the CEO of $OPEN, would you sell houses at a loss? Fuck no, in fact you would buy as many fucking houses as possible so you can cherry pick the wins and hold the rest. Inventory is up $6 BILLION from the end of 2020.

3) they have no money to fund growth, so they have to take on more and more debt

$OPEN is bleeding, but it still needs to put down cash for the equity portion of the mortgage, so what do they do? You can't keep issuing equity because that will tank the stock, so why not try SENIOR DEBT and high interest debt? Mezz mortgage debt was fetching 10% interest last quarter, and they issued senior debt to get $1B in cash to put into houses. 

4) Path to $0. This is a highly capital intensive business, which was a big reason why Zillow said fuck it we'd rather bee SaaS. Because $OPEN is bleeding money, This insatiable appetite for capital will slow down growth considerably, because no one is going to keep giving $OPEN billions of dollars to blow, leaving $OPEN with no choice but to start selling their shit houses and taking losses as opposed to buying more houses and holding the losers, this will cause a domino effect because the capital market will stop giving them capital to plop into more houses, which sits under a pile of senior mortgage debt, leading to less leads, less revenue,  and even less capital and MOAR losses. Remember when that happens $OPEN will STILL owe money to senior debtors. When no one is giving them money to buy houses and and labor expense is bleeding the company dry, plus billions in debt, there is only one way out. https://c.tenor.com/PW5xIUYKjB0AAAAC/declare-bankrupt.gif",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxntf4/open_to_0_yolo_40k_in_puts/

Now for some real ANALysis.

1) $OPEN's business is a structurally flawed highly leveraged hedge fund.

Open door takes capital, buys assets, and attempts to resell at a profit. Ignoring whether their skill at selling at a profit or not, they do NOT have enough capital on hand to actually buy these houses for cash, so they take on mortgages. What's worse, they take on SHORT TERM mortgages. As of Q3 $4B out of $5.3B of mortgage debt (backing $6.3B of real estate inventory) is due within one year. Why? To lower holding costs.

1,"11/20/2021, 03:31:11","NOVAVAX - first ""traditional"" Covid-19 vaccine",dkbbroker," **# The Group**

Novavax  is a US pharmaceutical company that received $1.6 billion from the  Trump administration in 2020 to develop a protein-based Covid-19  vaccine. The group had previously researched and developed many  vaccines, but never received regulatory approval.

&amp;#x200B;

**# The vaccine**

The  vaccine now developed, ""NVX-CoV2373"", is the result of past efforts and  has not only performed well compared to the Group's other vaccines, but  is nearing the end of the accelerated EU review process and thus free  for enter the market.

The vaccine  has already been approved in Indonesia and the EU Drug Administration  also said that the review has already started and the decision is  expected to be announced ""in a few weeks."" So the signals are good that  this will still happen in 2021.

The approval application for the U.S. is also planned by the end of the year.

If approved, the vaccine would be the world's first approved inactivated vaccine against covid-19.

So  unlike the four other approved mRNA/vector vaccines, this one does not  receive a genetic ""blueprint"" for production of the antigen by the  patient's own body, but instead introduces an inactive covid pathogen  into the immune system. So, as it is already known from other vaccines  that we know for decades.

&amp;#x200B;

**# Why this vaccine**

Since  it is now scientifically proven that the current vaccinations have a  much shorter efficacy than initially hoped for (maximum 6 months), the  recommendation is to perform the so-called booster vaccination  regularly.

Thereby the vaccination rates (according to [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID\_WRL](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL)) of the complete vaccination (i.e. double vaccinated) are worldwide at 41% and in Germany for example at 67%.

Many  of the unvaccinated have doubts about the so far less researched mRNA  or vector method and would prefer a ""classical"" dead vaccine. I could  imagine that also many would rather reach for the dead vaccine in case  of a (regular) booster.

&amp;#x200B;

**# The competition**

Besides Novavax, two other companies are publicly working on a dead vaccine.

One  is the French/Austrian company Valneva with ""VLA2001"", which is also  already in a large phase 3 study and is also achieving good results.  However, these are not that far along in the process and even though  Covid is, of course, an extremely hot patch, approvals take several  months. Applications have not yet been submitted for review here.

The  same is true for the French vaccine from Vidprevtyn. There are no  efficacy or side effect figures there at this time, nor an expected  date.

Ergo, Novavx is the only company that is close to approval and has a realistic chance of shaking up the vaccine market.

&amp;#x200B;

**# The numbers**

The  current market cap is \~$14B with a current share price of $193. In the 6  month chart, the price looks very interesting right now after being at  $260 USD in September.

I have to  honestly say now that I didn't even look that closely at the balance  sheet because I feel it is irrelevant in this context. Basically, of  course, 2020 went much better than the years before but in my estimation  the real bang comes with the (expected) EU approval in a few weeks.

The  equity/debt ratio is currently at 40/60 and revenues were at USD  $475.6M in 2020 which corresponds to a change in revenue of a whopping  2,448%. Now, of course, one could say that a lot of capital has already  flowed in here, but this is mainly due to the financial injection by the  US government described above.

Should  the valuation grow to a level similar to that of the other 4  pharmaceutical companies, then there is still a lot of potential here.

For  comparison, you can take a look at the growth of the four  pharmaceutical companies that have an approved vaccine on the market:

\- BioNTech

\- Moderna

\- AstraZeneca

\- Janssen-Cilag

&amp;#x200B;

**# Conclusion**

Since  the vaccine is already in use, no side effects have been observed, it  has a high efficacy and the EU has already secured 200 million doses, it  can be assumed that the approval is almost a mere formality.

Given  the general lack of confidence and the disappointing performance of  some of the current vaccines, I personally expect demand to be extremely  strong.

The current entry price at the current valuation should thus be very lucrative.

# Purpose

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.



# The Fundamental Constraint

**MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B\*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services.**

&amp;#x200B;

[The Underbanking Map](https://preview.redd.it/vpf82nkta1n61.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08837c21faf22549f3bfa8292a6fece047f9b4cd)

This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. Its going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

&amp;#x200B;

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why youre able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

&amp;#x200B;

[The KYC Bottleneck](https://preview.redd.it/shluc14va1n61.png?width=2073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c594663c43f266c2bab1d0bf5b4547b3d1da2382)

Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

[The KYC Solution](https://preview.redd.it/2oueufhxb1n61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b3d6e4bb85aa337ed3a0f581929b4d8c2e70eed)

It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

# The Underbanked

Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted

&amp;#x200B;

[The playbook](https://preview.redd.it/1eiwe2j1b1n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81927188476f40d136d884d18be7a5cb172ef49)

Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:

\- Cash Apps Twitter and advertising strategy

&amp;#x200B;

[Urban strategy](https://preview.redd.it/c4gc0lvfb1n61.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2b69447ee9c822aef198c97fcb83d7c992b886b)

&amp;#x200B;

[Youth strategy](https://preview.redd.it/dyhd7ssgb1n61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd5780a188b29e1a930b5d85cdd0272e01844a65)

\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching Cash App vs. Venmo. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

&amp;#x200B;

[Underbanking strategy](https://preview.redd.it/xruw28aib1n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c21fefe36277359c1d37adfa86b592d009af52)

&amp;#x200B;

It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Squares youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. Youve heard it before, why doesnt school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:

1. The ability to start a business
2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
3. The ability to invest and educate in B\*tcoin
4. The ability to save on basic purchases
5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

&amp;#x200B;

[Reality](https://preview.redd.it/hb2b2zljb1n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa1cce454480fe56d30489feeae3a52809dc559)

What this inevitably means is that we probably wont even see Square operating at full-force until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

# Speculation

This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:

1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Banks regulatory offerings.
2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.
4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.
5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
6. Square will foray into equal housing.
7. Square will improved loan systems.
8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.

So I have like 2 or 3 biotech stocks that I told myself I want to be in and take positions.

I have been closely monitoring $SAVA.

$SAVA is in phase three of there clinical trials for the drug simifilum which treats Alzheimers disease.

Its a new new to the market never before seen drug that shows excellent results so far and is close to being brought to market.

This stock has spiked above $120 three times in the past three months.

It crashed recently because of the market but also because theres an investigation concerning the data, information, and reliability of the results from the drug. 

This investigation was because of one lawyer. The company as a whole reject the accusations and state to their investors that they are working closely with the SEC and regulators and have provided all the information required and have stated that their is no proof or evidence to that lawyers claim who disputed the validity of the research findings.

From what I have read, the drug has proven great results and is new never before seen treatment for the Alzheimers disease.

Wall Street Journal among other medical and science publishers are currently praising the new drug.

This medication is close to being prepared to be brought to the market.

I scooped up shares at $48.00.

DYOR of course, but at this price, you should consider taking a look at this stock.

Im not playing any options currently as I have no idea when itll spike next.

I can tell you that once the investigation is completed and its proven that the case is dismissed, this thing will propel to new heights.

This is my opinion by the way.

$TAP (Molson Coors) one of the most HATED companies on Wallstreet is moving from being a beer company to a beverage company. They have market moving products that are becoming more commonplace like Topo Chico Seltzers and Zoa. 

I think it is an undervalued company. Its got the weight of KO (Coca Cola) behind them and beer staples like Yuengling, Leinenkugel, Vizzy, Miller, Coors, and Molson products. They are rolling out a national launch of Topo Chico hard seltzers and Topo Chico Ranch Water.

I am a big believer in DT and the performance of the team (Bill Stone &amp; Co) who are simply, like, amazing! Continuing my investigation into the rather obvious manipulation of $APPS stock by the likes of Fidelity, Blackrock, etc. Today, I went in to purchase options for the January 20, 2023 $140 Call option in my Fidelity account. Once again, for the second day in a row, I see that Fidelity shows a $197 Bid/ $205 Ask on this call, while on another screen it shows it at only $4.10 Bid / $4.80 ask. I suspect that this is not a mistake. Fidelity (and Blackrock, which are master manipulators) must know that the stock is actually worth much more. Any dumb DCF model or valuation would show you that. For instance, $1B in revenues compounded at 30% per year growth rate will give you around $300 per share (which means that DT is undervalued by 5X today!).

Now that lockdowns are ending and financial transactions are going back to pre pandemic level I believe this stock has great potential to go upside IMO. Again due deligence is required.

My discussion topic: As things return to normal and as major competitors such as Ciscos WebEx, Googles Meet, and Microsofts Teams encroach on zoom, its not looking good. 

But the stock is down from the lofty $400s already. Obviously I think it could fall further. I think they are the next Skype: video conferencing is only valuable when packaged with other business services. Its also just as easy to use FaceTime or Google Meet. I dont see zoom having any moat or innovation that cant be copied. 

Counter argument to this is sectors that dont use tech stacks heavily have adopted zoom. Im thinking Law, Academia, other light business etc. Also there is some stickiness in the space, particularly for older generations. 

Currently the stock trades at a PE multiple of 76. Thats a tech company valuation which is universally predicated on continued growth and growth potential. 

Im skeptical their forward guidance will indicate future growth. So a better multiple might be more along the lines of 30-50, which represents a drop of 50% to 33%.

&gt;The virtual world includes Nike buildings, fields and arenas for players to compete in various mini-games, ranging from tag and dodgeball to The Floor Is Lava. Its modeled after the companys real-life headquarters. Nikeland will be free (for now).  
The company eventually plans to integrate in-play moments that emulate global sporting events. Examples may include a soccer event during the World Cup or a flag football game during the Super Bowl. Nike said it will continue to update the virtual world to include athlete and product integration.  
People with accelerometers in their mobile devices will be able to use real-world movements to power their online play. For example, you can move your body in a jumping motion and it will translate in the virtual world to enhance the experience.  
Users will also be able to enter a digital showroom to dress their avatar in everything Nike and check out the companys latest product offerings. Items could be modeled after real-life Nike products being offered or from past launches. Nike could also tease future products or allow kids to co-create items.  
As the metaverse has come to the forefront, companies like Nike see the value in its ability to connect with a new generation of athletes and get them to fall in love with the brand, which can eventually translate into real-world sales.

1. amazon.com/redfin redirects to their home services page    
2. Similar to the Affirm situation, I believe there is a unique node ID, but this time it is hidden by url redirects. The node ID is contained in one of the redirect URLs . The node ID does not yield any google search results leading me to believe it is tied to either an upcoming or abandoned project: https://www.amazon.com/b?node=12636722011    
3. redfin.com/amazon redirects to redfin.com/company/amazon, but no other error pages adds that company part to the URL as far as I can tell    
4. Amazon has tested the housing market in recent years. They had an [Amazon TurnKey](https://coverager.com/introducing-turnkey-in-partnership-with-amazon/) pilot program which was in partnership with Realogy but suspended it supposedly due to COVID.    
5. Both companies are conveniently headquartered in Seattle    



Unlike the Affirm situation, however, I do not know when these redirects were set up. For all I know, they could have been unnoticed for years and be a relic of some abandoned idea.  


The word Redfin appears in the search bar of the page you instantly get redirected from. On an iPad I was able to access the empty page. It isnt particularly telling though. Affirms page literally said Pay Over Time with Affirm in the search bar.  


What I think could happen: It looks like Amazon has tested the waters with its TurnKey endeavors and theyre ready to make a bigger foray into the housing market. I have no clue what that entails, but I think an acquisition of Redfin seems more likely than a partnership. This is not the first time [this idea has been floated](https://www.inman.com/2019/02/06/should-amazon-buy-redfin/) (tbh I havent even read the article cuz it has some pay wall lol but you get the point)  


Even if my prediction ends up being correct again, I have no clue what the timeline on something like this would be. Housing seems like a logistical nightmare unlike Affirm integration. Could be years. So.. dont go buying weekly call options because you read something dumb on reddit. However, if I am wrong, I still think Redfin is a solid company with massive upside so Im not worried.  


Honorable mention: amazon.com/cvs, however, there is no node ID and CVS supposedly rejected Amazon earlier this year. Wouldnt count on this one.

Ok that is all. Back to my cave :)

From an article 
The new Covid variant circulating in South Africa that prompted UK travel restrictions is a ""huge international concern"", the health secretary says.

Sajid Javid said experience has shown ""we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment"".

He said it might be more transmissible, vaccines might be less effective against it and it might affect one of the UK's major treatments, Ronapreve.

Javid told the House of Commons it was ""highly likely"" the B.1.1.529 variant had already spread from South Africa and Botswana, where confirmed cases have been found, to other countries.

Travellers from these countries, as well as Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini, will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with those arriving after 04:00 GMT on Sunday required to quarantine in a hotel.

What do we know about this new variant?

What are the latest changes to UK travel rules?

Shares hit as new variant rattles investors

All flights from the six countries are also being suspended until the hotel quarantine system is in operation.

Mr Javid said he was concerned the variant ""may pose substantial risk to public health"" as it has ""an unusually high number of mutations"".

He said as well as possibly boosting transmission and affecting vaccine protection, the mutations may weaken the antibody treatment Ronapreve, which is beinggiven to the most vulnerable hospital patients.

""One of the lessons of this pandemic has been that we must move quickly, and at the earliest possible moment,"" he said.

We're heading into winter and our booster programme is still ongoing, so we must act with caution.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2mdu3/warning_to_entire_world_about_covid_variant_how/

**Yes, psychology really matters in the stock market trading.** Understanding the basic concepts like fundamental and technical analysis are also important but if you have weak psychology then you can't trade like professionals. You can be fearful on every movement of the market and you'll trade opposite than your plan due to not control on your biggest two emotions on the trading greed and fear. You'll exit your position in a small profit but hold your position during the loss which become you a unsuccessful trader.

(Bloomberg) -- Chinese regulators have asked Didi Global Inc.s top executives to devise a plan to delist from U.S. bourses, people familiar with the matter said, an unprecedented request thats likely to revive fears about Beijings intentions for its giant tech industry.

The countrys tech watchdog wants management to take the company off the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said. 

Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesdays close. 

Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didis biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo.

Deliberations continue and its possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.s in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didnt respond to requests for comment.

Didi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July. 

Its possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijings municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares. 

Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the companys U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies Inc. are Didis biggest minority shareholders.

Even if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag.

 

Regulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the worlds largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.

Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinpings administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or common prosperity, has targeted an internet sector thats accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.

A state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didis stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the countrys internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in Chinas largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc. 

Beijings moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didis IPO decision as a challenge to the central governments authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didis offices in July.

Its since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company thats traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.

# Abstract

$NLS

As the world is eyeing the possible end of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that investors currently see the at-home fitness industry as an industry inorganically fuelled by COVID-19 consumer habits. While one may agree with that hypothesis, Nautilus, along with its peers, have dropped circa 70% since their February highs. On an industry basis, investors may be too optimistic about consumer habits and life after COVID. The world has adapted to a hybrid WFH lifestyle post pandemic and physical exercise also indicates similar trends. The Les Mills October 2021 survey of 13,000 gym consumers worldwide, found that the majority of consumers favour a 60:40 split between gym and at home workouts. While 80% of those surveyed indicated that they plan to continue to use digital workouts post pandemic. This further iterates the total addressable market that JRNY is able to infiltrate and thereafter monetise. Further to that, it was found that digital fitness users workout 22% more than live only exercisers, while 84% of gym members continually workout at home also. It is clear that consumer trends are favouring organic growth over the coming years for Nautilus.

**The Industry**

The fitness industry as a whole has been one of very little growth or innovation within the last 2 decades. 2015 saw the first glimpse of innovation with the at home-workout industry trending into mainstream appeal. Since 2015, there has been a strong shift away from traditional gyms to boot camps and CrossFit, but these still pose the same legacy issues as traditional gyms. The at home fitness industry looks to bridge the gap between traditional gyms and the consumers homes. The industry saw considerable growth in 2020 given the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns that ensued and forced many gym members to look into alternative measures to exercise. It is important to note that overall, the at home gym sub-industry will not revolutionise the fitness industry or cause any significant decline in attendance to traditional gyms in the coming years. They are, however, targeting a niche market that does not want or use all the facilities of a traditional gym and are mainly interested in efficiency, comfort and body toning. Peloton and NLS have both presented data that young females are their main prevailing target market as made evident by proprietary data from both companies.

**Competition**

Nautilus business model currently obtains all its revenue from the sale of hardware equipment, while this is notably changing in the coming years, Technogym and Johnson Healthtech are competitors who also obtain all their revenue from the sale of hardware gym equipment. As made evident by Project North Star, NLS is investing in its subscription-based model to compete with the likes of Peloton, a company with a near-identical business model to the proposed transformed NLS. Thus, making these three companies perfectly aligned candidates for analysis. When compared to the relative valuation of its peers, NLS is the clearly undervalued. Investors currently see this industry, and specifically NLS to be reaping the benefits of COVID-19 consumer habits and will thereafter experience sales deflation due to reduced consumption. Previous to 2019 (Pre change of CEO), NLS was a hardware company with no roadmap to transform into a company that aligns with industry trends. Nautilus has been mismanaged historically, and the transformation of NLS does come in the form of a pristine C-Class executive team. An example of the mismanagement was the substantial overvaluation of Octane and the subsequent $70 Million write down in 2019. Given it appears the market is out of favour with the industry, and the new management team is yet to prove themselves, investors believe that NLS will underperform against their projections for the industry. Though with the introduction Project North Star, if management is able to deliver on their guidance and deliver organic growth, NLS is effectively undervalued relative to its peers.

**The Brands**

Nautilus currently has four brands that all receive their revenue from fitness products.

Bowflex:  
Bowlfex is undoubtedly the flagship brand, trusted by consumers for over thirty years. Bowflex produces revenue through two segments; Strength and Cardio. The brands main products are the Bowflex Max High Intensity Trainer, the innovative Bowflex VeloCore bike, and the patented Bowflex SelectTech dumbbells. The Bowflex VeloCore Bike is one of the first of its nature (see exhibit 2,3), the flexible nature of the seat allows the consumer to further enhance their experience and therefore increase consumer useability frequency.

Schwinnn:  
Schwinn was an innovator in bringing in the legacy cycling technology as seen in exhibit 5.

JRNY:  
JRNY is Nautilus subscription-based workout app. JRNY is now integrated with all major streaming services and on all Nautilus products (exhibit 4) and smartphones. JRNY will be the driving force in the digital revolution of the company.

Nautilus:  
This brand was the original brand that NLS produced but will soon not be a separate brand, but will intergrade into Bowflex and Schwinn.

**The Transformation**

James Barr was appointed CEO in July 2019 and initially made it his first priority to bring in a strong C-Class team to unwind some of the headwinds that previous executives had initiated. There were clear indications of the incompetence of previous management which Mr Barr had highlighted by the immediate changes that he initiated. Shortly into his tenure, Mr Barr initiated the sale of the Octane business, the source of the major write down that materialised in 2019. The second and more indicative of the incompetence was the change of the fiscal year to include the two quarters in which the seasonality of the business enjoys the greatest sales into one fiscal period.

This transformation was not able to be implanted initially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made its way around the world. Project North Star was initiated to introduce the transformation that Mr Barr is implementing to induce growth in the trajectory of the business. Project North Star proposes a 5-year transformation ending in FY2026. The project is built upon 5 pillars, two of which are to be instrumental in achieving the guidance proposed by management. The guidance provided is based upon a 10% 5-year CAGR in which subsequently NLS will achieve $1 billion in revenue of which 20% is attributed to JRNYs subscription model. This should be noted that this margin spread of 80/20 of hardware to subscription is what Peloton is currently achieving. Thus, the margins proposed do seem to be in line with industry trends. Recently, James was able to effectively summarise the project in one sentence; We are transforming Nautilus from a product-led hardware company to a consumer-led digital company.

https://preview.redd.it/q4nlf9nhkv181.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fadd9594412b60bafd79030267babe912238802

&amp;#x200B;

1. Scale Digital Offering

The crown jewel of the transformation is JRNY. A connected fitness, AI-driven, at home personal trainer for the consumers every need. Mr Barr has alluded to and communicated that the failure of previous management to enter into the connected fitness industry first could have been the initiation of the failure of Nautilus. NLS has made some very positive and

quick recent acquisitions and partnerships with companies like VAY and FitOn to ensure that JRNY is able to compete with the likes of One-Peloton. When asked if the capabilities of these companies cannot have been developed internally, James acknowledged that there is nothing that these acquisitions bring that NLS could not have developed internally. But he identified that due to the failure of NLS to enter into the connected fitness industry sooner, the prevailing position of NLS relative to its peers, James indicated that there was no time to waste on internally developing products that can be integrated almost instantly after an acquisition

2. Build Organisational Capabilities

The previous achievements of James in transforming businesses illustrate why this pillar, along with JRNY, are instrumental in the transformation of NLS. Most recently, at Ritchie Bros (RBA, Canada), he was able to hire top C- Class executives and completely change the digital framework of the company, with sales growing 400% in that period. Mr Barr was further able to revolutionise the customer experience digitally and implement a system much similar to the system he is currently envisioning for NLS. Previous to this, James was the Chief Digital Officer for OfficeMax that saw the company ranked 9th in revenues on the Internet Retailer Top 500 list by the end of his tenure. To further illustrate the changes that James is implementing at Nautilus, he has made the following additions:

* Garry R. Wiseman (Chief Digital Officer): Previous role, President of Digital Experience at Dell Computers.
* John R. Goelz (Chief Supply Chain Officer): Previous role, Vice President Global Supply Chain at Master Lock Co.
* Becky L. Alseth (Chief Marketing Officer): Previous role, Senior Vice President Marketing at Avis Rent a Car.
* Aina E. Konold (Chief Financial Officer): Previous role: Vice President Finance at Gap.  
The above 4 changes in executive leadership, bring the change needed to implement North Star and facilitate the guidance given for the transformation.

**Financials**

NLS is positioned well fundamentally and currently posts a strong balance sheet. Financially its evident that the industry is seasonal, with the strongest period being the winter months. Worldwide expansion and stability in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere will bring stability to the seasonality of revenues and further allow NLS to organically grow. The coefficient of variation for gross margin over the last 5-year period is 0.14, indicating no substantial dispersion, though a steady decline recently due to supply chain constraints. It should be noted that the coefficient of variation for the operating margin is 1.19, indicating substantial variance. This signifies that though the company has been able to manage its supply chain and its pricing power, the large variance in operating margin is indicative of the nature of the competition in the industry. This should be noted that operating margins will continue to come under pressure as the industry becomes more established and more firms come into the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/mp0axc3jkv181.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5387f142c53f34a028ef5f519b161e653a833eba

It is evident that on a relative valuation basis that NLS is trading at a discount historically. Provided management is able to fulfil its plan to transform the business to a subscription-based model, we will begin to see margins elevate. They are currently under pressure due to the supply chain constraints facing the world. This has caused management to heavily invest in their working capital through inventory management and therefore look to fully capitalise on their strong seasons.

NLS has been able to work down the backlog of orders and built a substantial inventory level to not hinder what is usually considered their strong season. Efficiency has been at the forefront of Aina Konolds recent communications. An increase in the inventory turnover ratio to over 6x in recent quarters (on an LTM basis), when compared to a historical average of 4.1, is largely attributed to this increase in inventory. This is estimated to decline back to historical levels by FY2023. This stacking of inventory could see lower investment into working capital in the coming quarters which could see increases in cash flow from operations.

https://preview.redd.it/yjhru3dkkv181.png?width=222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d5e548ea74fe6876eaadb16c121228dd6fd1346

*Liquidity*

NLS strong balance sheet is enabled by its low total debt and large cash position. The current cash position is 30% of the total market capitalisation of NLS while the Cash/Total Debt ratio is 2x, indicating no immediate short/long term liquidity issues.

Though NLS is not yet earning a material percent of its revenue from their subscription-based product, Peloton is their main competitor for market share. Though PTON has shown similar pricing trends as NLS over the last 6-month period, the financials of the companies are very different. To consider pricing power and the tailwinds of the supply chain issues mentioned by both companies, gross margin comparisons indicate that (June 2021, LTM and December 2020, LTM) NLS dropped 3 percentage points while PTON dropped 4 percentage points to 38.7 and 35.2 respectively. It should also be noted that PTON does have a substantial segment of subscription-based sales which does increase margins when compared to traditional hardware sales. Given that over 95% of all NLS revenue is from hardware sales, their gross margins being indicatively larger does indicate pricing power.

To combat supply chain tailwinds on margins, management has indicated that a decision was made to decrease SG&amp;A which saw a decrease from 23.6% to 20.5% (SG&amp;A to sales) while PTON has shown an increase from 33.5% to 38.4%. To further illustrate the tailwinds that PTON margins are indicating, operating margins increased for NLS while operating margins decreased from positive to negative for PTON. The efficiency of management is further highlighted in the turnover analysis. For the LTM ending June 2021, Inventory turnover remained steady at 6x while PTON decreased from 5.5x to 4.4x. The strategic managerial decision to drastically increase inventory entering into the seasonally busy period to avoid any tailwinds will see these figures increase over the coming months. When compared to PTON, NLS has low levels of leverage with Total Debt/Total Capital for NLS at 17.4% while PTON is 46.3%. When compared to PTON, NLS low financial leverage allows them to be flexible in their investment into Project North Star. Given the shift to a more subscription-based revenue model coupled with low financial leverage will allow NLS to reduce operating leverage through the drop in fixed costs.

**Valuation**

The valuation of NLS was completed using a Discounted Cash Flow model as well as a relative valuation.

To effectively value NLS one must capitalise R&amp;D rather than expense the investment. With the shift to a more technological change in the structure of the company, this will become a more prevailing distinguishment between valuations of NLS in the coming years.

Given the conservative nature of the assumptions made with respect to growth, it is evident that there is room for organic development coming out of the pandemic.

Under these assumptions, the intrinsic value calculated for NLS is $28.70 - $34.73.

https://preview.redd.it/vofwb1xlkv181.png?width=224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61b72fb56d3b1c83d28c2f17e531959bcc61a8ca

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst**

NLS currently has a high level of short interest, with a reported 15.74% of the float currently held short. The thesis behind these short positions is largely based on the estimated decline in YoY sales. While the run-up earlier in the year could be viewed as premature or based on the temporary change in consumer habits, the fundamentals do indicate potential organic growth. As James has indicated, there is no time for waiting around and creating the technology for JRNY. Thus, NLS will continue to make strategic partnerships and acquire companies to increase their customer base as well as their offering.

With very little debt, cash close to a third of the total market cap and the potential to be a turnaround company, NLS could be viewed as also in a prime position to be bought out. This could be from a competitor or from a new entrant attempting to buy a portfolio of great products at a cheap price.

**Risks**

The risks that face Nautilus are sizeable and mainly attributed to macroeconomic factors.

*Consumer trends*

The most profound of any risk that prevails over NLS is the consumer trends for the at home fitness industry. Though the industry has seen unprecedented inorganic growth, only hindsight will indicate the retention that NLS and the industry was able to obtain from this change in environmental and economic factors.

*Supply Chain Constraints*

Though the final goal is for NLS to obtain a material percent of their revenues from subscriptions, they are currently primarily producing the majority of their revenues from the sale of hardware products and thus will continue to see margins swing with supply chain changes. Margins will continue to be under pressure with shipping costs increasing close to 100% YoY.

*North Star progress*

Provided that North Star is the companys transformation, any subsequent delay or downgrades to the guidance given to the FY2026 timeline will see large volatility in the stock price. Though depending on the weight of the impact, these may be considered short term constraints.

*Capital allocation*

The company has a large cash balance, providing management with a subsequent decision on how to reinvest in the company. Misallocation of cash, could be detrimental to the North Star project and hence cause material deterioration to the companys financials.

**Conclusion**

Nautilus is currently suffering from previous brand issues and a market assumption on the industry. Though historically, at the right time, investors who were able to identify industry and subsequently companies who are suffering short term headwinds but indicate strong growth long term, are able to capitalise on this.

There were clear indications of the incompetence of previous management which Mr Barr had highlighted by the immediate changes that he initiated.

Project North Star was initiated to introduce the transformation that Mr Barr is implementing to induce growth in the trajectory of the business. Project North Star proposes a 5-year transformation ending in FY2026. The project is built upon 5 pillars, two of which are to be instrumental in achieving the guidance proposed by management. The guidance provided is based upon a 10% 5-year CAGR in which subsequently NLS will achieve $1 billion in revenue of which 20% is attributed to JRNYs subscription model. This should be noted that this margin spread of 80/20 of hardware to subscription is what Peloton is currently achieving. Thus, the margins proposed do seem to be in line with industry trends. Recently, James was able to effectively summarise the project in one sentence;  We are transforming Nautilus from a product-led hardware company to a consumer-led digital company. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Scale Digital Offering 

The crown jewel of the transformation is JRNY. A connected fitness, AI-driven, at home personal trainer for the consumers every need. Mr Barr has alluded to and communicated that the failure of previous management to enter into the connected fitness industry first could have been the initiation of the failure of Nautilus. NLS has made some very positive and 

quick recent acquisitions and partnerships with companies like VAY and FitOn to ensure that JRNY is able to compete with the likes of One-Peloton. When asked if the capabilities of these companies cannot have been developed internally, James acknowledged that there is nothing that these acquisitions bring that NLS could not have developed internally. But he identified that due to the failure of NLS to enter into the connected fitness industry sooner, the prevailing position of NLS relative to its peers, James indicated that there was no time to waste on internally developing products that can be integrated almost instantly after an acquisition 

2. Build Organisational Capabilities 

The previous achievements of James in transforming businesses illustrate why this pillar, along with JRNY, are instrumental in the transformation of NLS. Most recently, at Ritchie Bros (RBA, Canada), he was able to hire top C- Class executives and completely change the digital framework of the company, with sales growing 400% in that period. Mr Barr was further able to revolutionise the customer experience digitally and implement a system much similar to the system he is currently envisioning for NLS. Previous to this, James was the Chief Digital Officer for OfficeMax that saw the company ranked 9th in revenues on the Internet Retailer Top 500 list by the end of his tenure. To further illustrate the changes that James is implementing at Nautilus, he has made the following additions: 

* Garry R. Wiseman (Chief Digital Officer): Previous role, President of Digital Experience at Dell Computers. 
* John R. Goelz (Chief Supply Chain Officer): Previous role, Vice President Global Supply Chain at Master Lock Co. 
* Becky L. Alseth (Chief Marketing Officer): Previous role, Senior Vice President Marketing at Avis Rent a Car.
* Aina E. Konold (Chief Financial Officer): Previous role: Vice President Finance at Gap.   
 The above 4 changes in executive leadership, bring the change needed to implement North Star and facilitate the guidance given for the transformation. 

**Financials**

NLS is positioned well fundamentally and currently posts a strong balance sheet. Financially its evident that the industry is seasonal, with the strongest period being the winter months. Worldwide expansion and stability in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere will bring stability to the seasonality of revenues and further allow NLS to organically grow. The coefficient of variation for gross margin over the last 5-year period is 0.14, indicating no substantial dispersion, though a steady decline recently due to supply chain constraints. It should be noted that the coefficient of variation for the operating margin is 1.19, indicating substantial variance. This signifies that though the company has been able to manage its supply chain and its pricing power, the large variance in operating margin is indicative of the nature of the competition in the industry. This should be noted that operating margins will continue to come under pressure as the industry becomes more established and more firms come into the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

[     ](https://preview.redd.it/9bdbb85cgv181.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed500d950d84e41b4189ffd910a138408a790d10)

It is evident that on a relative valuation basis that NLS is trading at a discount historically. Provided management is able to fulfil its plan to transform the business to a subscription-based model, we will begin to see margins elevate. They are currently under pressure due to the supply chain constraints facing the world. This has caused management to heavily invest in their working capital through inventory management and therefore look to fully capitalise on their strong seasons. 

NLS has been able to work down the backlog of orders and built a substantial inventory level to not hinder what is usually considered their strong season. Efficiency has been at the forefront of Aina Konolds recent communications. An increase in the inventory turnover ratio to over 6x in recent quarters (on an LTM basis), when compared to a historical average of 4.1, is largely attributed to this increase in inventory. This is estimated to decline back to historical levels by FY2023. This stacking of inventory could see lower investment into working capital in the coming quarters which could see increases in cash flow from operations.

*Liquidity* 

NLS strong balance sheet is enabled by its low total debt and large cash position. The current cash position is 30% of the total market capitalisation of NLS while the Cash/Total Debt ratio is 2x, indicating no immediate short/long term liquidity issues. 

Though NLS is not yet earning a material percent of its revenue from their subscription-based product, Peloton is their main competitor for market share. Though PTON has shown similar pricing trends as NLS over the last 6-month period, the financials of the companies are very different. To consider pricing power and the tailwinds of the supply chain issues mentioned by both companies, gross margin comparisons indicate that (June 2021, LTM and December 2020, LTM) NLS dropped 3 percentage points while PTON dropped 4 percentage points to 38.7 and 35.2 respectively. It should also be noted that PTON does have a substantial segment of subscription-based sales which does increase margins when compared to traditional hardware sales. Given that over 95% of all NLS revenue is from hardware sales, their gross margins being indicatively larger does indicate pricing power. 

To combat supply chain tailwinds on margins, management has indicated that a decision was made to decrease SG&amp;A which saw a decrease from 23.6% to 20.5% (SG&amp;A to sales) while PTON has shown an increase from 33.5% to 38.4%. To further illustrate the tailwinds that PTON margins are indicating, operating margins increased for NLS while operating margins decreased from positive to negative for PTON. The efficiency of management is further highlighted in the turnover analysis. For the LTM ending June 2021, Inventory turnover remained steady at 6x while PTON decreased from 5.5x to 4.4x. The strategic managerial decision to drastically increase inventory entering into the seasonally busy period to avoid any tailwinds will see these figures increase over the coming months. When compared to PTON, NLS has low levels of leverage with Total Debt/Total Capital for NLS at 17.4% while PTON is 46.3%. When compared to PTON, NLS low financial leverage allows them to be flexible in their investment into Project North Star. Given the shift to a more subscription-based revenue model coupled with low financial leverage will allow NLS to reduce operating leverage through the drop in fixed costs.

**Valuation** 

The valuation of NLS was completed using a Discounted Cash Flow model as well as a relative valuation. 

To effectively value NLS one must capitalise R&amp;D rather than expense the investment. With the shift to a more technological change in the structure of the company, this will become a more prevailing distinguishment between valuations of NLS in the coming years. 

Given the conservative nature of the assumptions made with respect to growth, it is evident that there is room for organic development coming out of the pandemic. 

Under these assumptions, the intrinsic value calculated for NLS is $28.70 - $34.73. 

https://preview.redd.it/w0w9br4lgv181.png?width=221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46a1194205ae6271b9c182b5bf0e611b768f9b5e

**Catalyst** 

NLS currently has a high level of short interest, with a reported 15.74% of the float currently held short. The thesis behind these short positions is largely based on the estimated decline in YoY sales. While the run-up earlier in the year could be viewed as premature or based on the temporary change in consumer habits, the fundamentals do indicate potential organic growth. As James has indicated, there is no time for waiting around and creating the technology for JRNY. Thus, NLS will continue to make strategic partnerships and acquire companies to increase their customer base as well as their offering. 

With very little debt, cash close to a third of the total market cap and the potential to be a turnaround company, NLS could be viewed as also in a prime position to be bought out. This could be from a competitor or from a new entrant attempting to buy a portfolio of great products at a cheap price. 

**Risks** 

The risks that face Nautilus are sizeable and mainly attributed to macroeconomic factors. 

*Consumer trends* 

The most profound of any risk that prevails over NLS is the consumer trends for the at home fitness industry. Though the industry has seen unprecedented inorganic growth, only hindsight will indicate the retention that NLS and the industry was able to obtain from this change in environmental and economic factors. 

*Supply Chain Constraints* 

Though the final goal is for NLS to obtain a material percent of their revenues from subscriptions, they are currently primarily producing the majority of their revenues from the sale of hardware products and thus will continue to see margins swing with supply chain changes. Margins will continue to be under pressure with shipping costs increasing close to 100% YoY. 

*North Star progress* 

Provided that North Star is the companys transformation, any subsequent delay or downgrades to the guidance given to the FY2026 timeline will see large volatility in the stock price. Though depending on the weight of the impact, these may be considered short term constraints. 

*Capital allocation* 

The company has a large cash balance, providing management with a subsequent decision on how to reinvest in the company. Misallocation of cash, could be detrimental to the North Star project and hence cause material deterioration to the companys financials. 

**Conclusion** 

Nautilus is currently suffering from previous brand issues and a market assumption on the industry. Though historically, at the right time, investors who were able to identify industry and subsequently companies who are suffering short term headwinds but indicate strong growth long term, are able to capitalise on this.

# Wednesday Nov. 24 US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks rose as investors ignored tapering concerns raised in the minutes of the Federal Reserve's most recent meeting. As short-end rates rose, the dollar strengthened and the yield curve flattened.
* Following the release of the minutes, the S&amp;P 500 rose briefly, with real estate and energy stocks leading gains. The Nasdaq 100, which is heavily weighted toward technology, outperformed major benchmarks. Trading volume has been lower than usual in the run-up to the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.
* The dollar index has risen to its highest level since July 2020. Despite accelerating inflation, data released earlier today showed a resilient US consumer.
* The committee ""would not hesitate to take appropriate actions to address inflation pressures,"" according to the Fed meeting minutes from November 2-3. Since then, inflation has risen to its highest level since 1990, prompting Fed officials to suggest that a faster pace of tapering should be discussed at the December meeting.
* This has caused a rise in treasury yields, with the two-year yield reaching its highest level since early March 2020 and markets bringing forward bets on rate hikes.
* Personal spending in the United States increased more than expected in October from the previous month, while a closely watched inflation measure showed the largest annual increase in three decades. Furthermore, data show that 199,000 people filed initial jobless claims in the week ending November 20, the fewest since 1969, while orders placed with U.S. factories for business equipment rose more than expected in October, indicating solid momentum for capital investment at the start of the fourth quarter.
* Policymakers are now focused on containing inflation, with ultra-loose, the pandemic-era stimulus set to be phased out. At the same time, investors are nervous about the resurgence of COVID-19, particularly in Europe.
* Oil fell slightly the day after US stockpiles increased and the announcement of a coordinated release of crude from strategic reserves.
* The White House announced on Tuesday that a release of 50 million barrels from its reserves in coordination with the US, China, Japan, India, the UK, and South Korea.

1,"11/26/2021, 08:17:09",New COVID-19 variant B.1.1.529,Nobistle,"So recently a new COVID mutation was discovered in SA. The new variant shows alot of mutations some of which are quite concerning.
Since no one here is an expert or anything on this topic (me included) I will stick to posting threads where actual experts try to explain what that means:

[thread with mutations and their meaning.](https://mobile.twitter.com/jcbarret/status/1463975708770897923

[Eric Feigl-Dings thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1463765169830572039)

And some more just search them up yourself.

However some of those threads suggest that the vaccine has little to no efficacy against that new variant. That begs the question how are the beloved MRNA stocks going to react to that?

Right now the amount of data is very small but in the second thread linked there is a case of a 38y/o fully vaccinated with the Biontech/Pfizer vaccine. He had a negative PCR test and just 4 days later had a virus load of PCR value 18 and 19.

So what is your general opinion will negative news concerning the old vaccine hurt the stocks since they might not be used anymore OR will it skyrocket the stocks since everyone has to get a new double dose of vaccine for exactly that mutation?

**Your NAGA Trading account/s**

Following discussion with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the ""**FCA**""), **NAGA Group AG** has decided to withdraw from the UK market and to cease providing services to UK-resident clients.

As such, we give you notice that we will be taking steps to terminate your agreement with **NAGA Markets Europe Ltd**   and to ensure the liquidation of your open trading positions, the   return to you of any positive balances that your account/s may contain   and the closure of your account/s. The following timetable has been   notified to the FCA, which is consistent with **NAGA Markets Europe Ltd's** terms of business.

* **NAGA Markets Europe Ltd**   will close and liquidate all your open trading positions and convert   any positive positions into cash balances in your base currency by no   later than **3 pm (GMT) on 17 December 2021**.  Any hedged positions would be netted off at that point;
* You may close and liquidate your positions in the period leading up to **9 pm (GMT) on 14 December 2021**   but you will not be permitted to deposit any more funds into your   account/s. If your positions reach a margin close out level after that   point but before manual closure, the positions will be closed   automatically;
* The  reason for the gap in time between 14 and 17 December 2021  is to allow  internal processes to be engaged to close out open positions  and then  accounts so as to meet the 3 pm (GMT) 17 December 2021  deadline;
* Any   positive cash balances held by you following the closure and   liquidation of your open positions will be returned to you to the bank   account and/or card and/or funding method you used for the purposes of   crediting your trading account/s, for which we have details in our   system, by no later than **31 December 2021.**

Should   you have any questions concerning the closure and liquidation of your   open positions, the return of your balances and closure of your trading   account/s, please see the [**FAQs**](https://support.naga.com/en/collections/3232988-uk-based-clients-only) that have been prepared or contact our [**Customer Support Team.**](mailto:support@naga.com)

1,"11/26/2021, 05:34:00",New research - the top 5 most traded companies by retail traders/apes over the last week,vilnitskiy,"We all know that 2021 has proven to be a breakthrough year for us, my dear apes, retail traders. According to the U.S. News &amp; World Report reported on Wednesday (June 30), retail investors currently account for roughly 10% of daily trading volume on the Russell 3000, the broadest U.S. stocks index, after peaking at 15% in September as lockdown boredom and extra savings triggered interest in stock markets. 

Since we definitely have a great influence on the overall trading situation, I decided to conduct new research on the most popular companies over the last week based on retail traders activity (buying/selling), as well as the sentiment of their tendencies.

Let's drill into this and discover the top 5 companies by percentage of trades by retail traders for the last week:

**1. Tesla (**[**$TSLA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/TSLA)**)**

Even after selling billion worth of shares by Elon Musk, $TSLA remains the most valuable automaker in the world, with a market valuation &gt;$1 trillion.

**2. Lucid Group, Inc. (**[**$LCID**](https://contora.ai/ticker/LCID)**)** \- is a technology and automotive company. It develops the next generation of electric vehicle (EV) technologies.

**3. Nvidia (**[**$NVDA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/NVDA)**)** \- operates as a visual computing company worldwide in two segments, Graphics and Compute &amp; Networking.

Btw, $NVDA shares bounced back today from their mini sell-off - it happened after **Nvidia** crushed Wall Street's expectations when it released its fiscal 2022 third-quarter results on November 17th, with its record numbers and impressive guidance sending the stock up 8% to a new all-time high post the release.

**5. AMD (**[**$AMD**](https://contora.ai/ticker/AMD)**)** \- for more than 50 years Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has driven innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies - the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms, and the data center.

1,"11/26/2021, 04:28:28",Tickle Me $SIMO - Mega Memory Upside (v2),BigDaddyDLo,"&gt;SIMO starts with S and S looks like $. Coincidence? Not in this market! - Gandhi, 1901

Now with catalysts!

# KEY POINTS

* SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory
* Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside when cycles exit troughs (\*we are here)
* MU makes up 24% of revenues, followed by other semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy
* Consensus Price Target: $98, but read thesis, these are significantly low
* Cheap Options = Falcon9 Blastoff Returns

# Company Description (ELI50 for Boomers)

Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMOs products.

# Bull/Only Thesis

This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).

What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good.

More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no.

In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

Luckily, Needham modeled this for us:

[https://preview.redd.it/bo05eem52e181.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f1607d0a927283069d1c24f6a53299596fca75](https://preview.redd.it/bo05eem52e181.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f1607d0a927283069d1c24f6a53299596fca75)

Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.

# Valuation &amp; Financials

* Current Fwd P/E: 11.6
   * Past cycles have reached Fwd P/Es of 15-20+, insinuating 50-100% upside from current levels? Wrong. Every cycle works like this: Cycle in Trough? EPS gets cut. Cycle reaccelerates? Analysts start falling over themselves to raise estimates. You get multiple expansion on top of higher estimates. *(See CHART 1 &amp; 2)*. Did I mention SIMO never actually had estimates cut, unlike its customers?
* Sales Growth: 70% 21, 15% 22? No
   * Estimates currently model for only $1.06B in 2022, a 15% increase over 2021. On their last call, management stated a $1.5B backlog while also successfully securing more foundry space at TSMC. SIMO has pricing power and can continue to pass on any costs to keep margins fat as they have for years.
* EPS Growth 21: On track for 87%
   * This is despite constraints in their memory &amp; storage end market. As these manufacturing constraints are easing, SIMOs sales &amp; EPS should finally rocket higher into 2022 (more chips produced = more revenue for SIMO).
* EPS Growth 22: Currently 19%
   * These are flat out wrong, as analysts have not revised models to account for the $1.5B sales backlog. With memory now exiting a cyclical trough, these figures will be revised higher, especially as analysts start to chase memory stock momentum.
* EV/EBITDA 22: 7.37
   * Enterprise Value (backs out cash) presents an even better picture than Fwd P/E.
* Indicated Dividend: 2.8%
   * Well above the S&amp;P 500 (1.2%) and the 10yr treasury after a recent 40% hike, perfectly price for retiree boomer WSBers, too.

# Technical Setup

SIMO has been consolidating along a rising 150DMA since October. The 20DMA converged with the 150DMA, and is starting to liftoff.

If you exclude the Q3 failed breakout thanks to the blink-and-you-missed-it Q4 cyclical downturn, SIMO has basically been a steady climber all of 2021. Relative strength has been rising recently as funds inevitably start their re-entry. Funds dont appreciate the power and swiftness of todays markets, and will chase this as it starts shooting up.

# Upcoming Catalysts

**SIMO consistently goes HAM in Decembers, so back up the trucks ahead of the Santa Claus rally.**

# How to Play

*Very Risk Averse*: March 22 80 Calls. Current Bid/Ask 2.15/3.00, presenting 5-6x returns on a rebound to $80 and 25% breakout to $100.

*Quasi-risk Averse*: Jan 22 80 calls. Current Bid/Ask 1.2/1.4, presenting 14-16.5x returns on a rebound to $80 and 25% breakout to $100.

*Pump It Up*: Dec 75 calls. Current Bid/Ask 0.75/1.00, presenting 15-20x returns if strong flows cause a breakout to $90 as funds return to memory stocks after a 2-3mo distribution period and ahead of MU earnings confirming that everything is blasting off.

*WSB Delight*: Dec 80 calls. Current Bid/Ask 0.3/0.55, presenting 18-33x returns if the same scenario plays out.

I currently own Dec 75 calls.

Looks like I have used up all my brain cells on this one and still can figure this shit out...

So I have generally ICs are a combination of put spread and call spreads with objective that the price will be in a range, which uses a bit of margin...

Scenario 1 Traditional IC:

I make traditional IC with 1SD spread and I get 115 at expiry but the collateral ($ 250) is blocked until then.

Scenario 2 Stupid IC:

I make IC with calls and it costs me $140 upfront, though I profit only $110 ($5 less than traditional IC also lose $5 more if the planets don't align up) and still use the remaining $110 to lose on other shitty trades...

So my question is why in the world would use traditional IC and not the Stupid IC is it just the $5 gap and not the opportunity cost of liquid money..?.

Is it just me or do I need to apply for the Nobel prize in economics for this discovery?

We are going to start the presale of our cryptocurrency soon and wanted to create a legitimate project for the future. Here is everything about our project laid out and feel free to let us know what you think? Or how it can be improved?

**I know this is a long article. But I wanted to explain our plan to you and hopefully get the help of the community.**

I am based in the US and opened up an LLC for the project. The name and logo have trademarks submitted.

**We are working hard to become a legitimate project and we are going to have our presale soon.**

The reason I contacted the Wall Street Bets community. They seem to be the best fit to start a fun legitimate project.

**Our supply is limited to 2,100,000 tokens total. The presale will be around 700k tokens. The other 700k is locked into liquidity. The last portion is stored in the vault.**

Each token will be valued at 1 dollar.

The distribution of funds raised will break down exactly to the dollar.

Coin Investment Distribution

$1 = 1 CHAD

.6 Liquidity Pool = $472,469.44

.3 Marketing = $236,249

.1 Team = $78,749.90

The funds for the team are needed and are not in excess. I personally have invested heavily in the project and other team members I need to pay a portion to.

Marketing is the secret sauce that I have been optimizing for Giga Chad Coin.

**If Giga Chad Coin invests a portion of the presale funds into low-cost marketing. The value of the coin should increase and presale investors will not lose money.**

**Making sure our cryptocurrency community doesnt lose money is a top priority.**

The vault was made as an asset to generate funds to reinvest into the project.

**Our cryptocurrency coin is preparing for the future.**

The project we have been working on outside of the cryptocurrency is a game called Bounty Hunter.

**This is a future Battle Royal Game that implements our cryptocurrency.**

We will be building the project on Unreal Engine 4 and will be similar to Warzone or Battlefield.

**The unique part of the project is the implementation of the blockchain.**

Gaming has been pretty trash for a while FPS-wise and we would like to produce something unique.

The difference between our game and other battle royal games. When a person starts a match. They pay a certain amount in Giga Chad Coin to enter the battle royal.

**If a player is killed in the battle royal match. A portion of their Giga Chad Coin is transferred to the player who eliminated them.**

This creates a system where people could earn money and play our game as a full-time job.

There would be real pro players that generate an income from playing the game. The game will have no casino-like gimmicks that make it harder to win.

It will strictly focus on competitive skill-based gameplay.

**An above 1 K/D player over the lifetime of playing the game would have earned more cryptocurrency than they started with.**

**This game will also try to implement the most advanced anti-cheat. To ensure the best experience.**

**This we plan to implement in VR after the release of PC.**

When Mark Zuckerberg came out with his pr introducing the metaverse.

It looked trash.why would I want to go to work in the metaverse.

The last thing we want is for corporations to decide what the metaverse is going to be.

So with the vault, we could focus on building the digital world the community wants in the metaverse and trying to implement cool things like Bounty Hunter.

On benefits from the expanding gross margin, profitability, and cash flow that comes from higher volume, lower supply costs, and more efficient manufacturing. In addition, ON also has significant content in 5G telecom infrastructure and cloud computing applications touching base on all three major macro trends we have identified (5G rollout, cloud computing and EVs).

\-The company stands to benefit from the adoption of EVs over the next 10 years moving from around 12% of total vehicle sales in 2020 to around 62% in 2030. To put this growth in perspective the US sells around 17 million vehicles per year with the European Union selling around 15 million units and China accounting for about 19-22 million vehicles each year so the market is massive. At least 25 million more EVs per year will be added to the mix over the next 10 years providing strong unit volume growth of EV's in total and strong growth opportunity for ON.

\-ON's current content per car is around $160 and is expected to be over $715 per car in 2022 and to be over $1,500 by 2025 as semiconductor content per car grows dramatically with the adoption of EVs and ADAS or autonomous driving features in cars . The total semi content per car is expected to grow to over $1,500 by 2025 as both ADAS and EVs drive significant content growth per car for ON. So the number of EV's sold annually will grow from around 9 million in 2020 to 62 million in 2030 or a 7x increase over a ten year period and the silicon content per car for ON is growing more than 2x over the next 3-4 years driving a double whammy for top line growth for the company. ON predicts its power business will grow by a CAGR of 15% over the next four years with intelligent sensing business growing by a CAGR of 13% over the same period. By end market automotive revenue should grow by a CAGR of 17% (versus market growth of around 4-6%) and the industrial market should grow by a CAGR of 7% versus market growth of around 4-5%. Industrial and automotive make up about 60% of ON's revenue now moving to over 75% by 2025 as the mix shifts into higher margin product lines.

\-ON has around $2,000-$4,000 in content per EV charging station which should be another huge driver of growth as all the EV's sold will need to be charged and with the company's expertise in silicon carbide (SiC) process technology ON should be one of the leaders in SiC applications for both cars (more efficient battery management systems leading to longer travel time) and fast charging, which is now moving to the 20-30 minute range when using SiC chips from ON.

\-The company also has exposure to 5G infrastructure and cloud computing with around $300 in content per platform giving ON exposure to all three major macro trends we really like. The company's content per platform should continue to increase as ON finds new applications with current customers as equipment becomes faster and more sophisticated managing the power flow and consumption becomes ever more critical.

\-Another thing we like about the ON story is the gross margin expansion opportunities which should mover from 38% to 45% over the next few years and we believe this business can have gross margins in the 48-52% range over the longer term as ON sheds less profitable segments (probably eliminating 10-15% of current sales over the next few years), ON sees a major mix shift to higher margin products in the industrial and automotive segments, the company lowering costs in the supply chain and fab balancing eliminating older less efficient fabs and loading as much as possible into the company's 300mm fab in upstate NY. All of these actions will drive significant gross margin, cash flow and EPS expansion hopefully making it a successful investment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25kr0/on_semiconductor_dd/

1,"11/26/2021, 03:30:25","Curious case of Blackberry 38,000 patents! Part I",ModernBuddha1,"When we hear the word Blackberry we immediately think of the BB famous keyboard phones. That blackberry is DEAD!!! The **new blackberry** since 2013 is a **pure software company** leading the cybersecurity, iot, and connected cars (EV + ICE) revolution. Many at this point are probably raising eyebrows in disbelief, that's exactly the type of reaction I get from about 8 out of 10 people. This is fault of the company for not being aggressive on consumer front in advertising but I can also see why they shied away from it. BB is a B2B company and so they have been aggressively partnering with 100s of companies to embed their SW into semiconductor, ADAS, and other iot chips/devices(cars, drones, etc 265 design wins in last 2 years). 

The new BB has 38,000 patents ([here](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q4y2021/q4-fy21-transcript.pdf)), leader in Zero Trust Cybersecurity ([here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/unified-endpoint-security)), and leader in embedded iot software ([here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/embedded-solutions)).  

**The 38,000 patents (gold of today)**  
Now lets get back to the correct number of patents. There has been lot of speculation and confusion in the media about number of patents owned by Blackberry. Many at one point thought it was only 18,000 patents, then only 30,000 patents, but the TRUE number is staggering 38,000 patents. I have put together some sources on where i got the number from below. First the CEO confirming in Q4 FY21 earning ([here](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q4y2021/q4-fy21-transcript.pdf)) to an analyst asking for the correct number. And then just in 2020(during covid shutdown) they managed to get 2,000 more patents. Like this article ([here](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ec56f1c7-5ce9-4182-a437-0840d802cfd8)) suggest the number is closer to **40,000 patents as of TODAY**.   
 

&gt;**Trip Chowdhry, Global Equities Research:** Second question I had was regarding the intellectual property portfolio you have. The last time I counted it was more than 30,000 patents.   
&gt;  
&gt;**John Chen:** 38,000 to be exact. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Next few weeks are critical** as they plan on selling off the patent portfolio(**20k patents**) related to messaging, devices, wireless, etc since they no longer make hardware phones. JC the ceo said by end of November or before the ER on Dec 21st the company will either announce the patent deal or walk away. He has been negotiating the deal since last Christmas and now he's tired of pushing it out. If the deal goes through it will be minimum 1 Billion added to BB cash pile of $800m This will be huge for the SP as all the revenue from patent licensing is pulled up front for investment in growth. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Paul Treiber, RBC Capital Markets**  Oh, hi, John. The first question on the patent sale, I know you cant say much just given youre in the middle of negotiations, but your statement you mentioned that the negotiations are going well but then you also indicated that if it doesnt close you have other options. Just could you bridge between those two statements because theyre are actually quite far apart from a tone perspective?    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;John Chen  Thats good, thats a good one, Im glad you caught it. Yes, it is going well, **I fully expect to finish this, this quarter, but Im tired of waiting**. I know a lot of our investors are too. Im not blaming anything on anybody, and maybe we have too many lawyers assigned to this. Sorry lawyers, but the key is its a complex and big portfolio. Its rightfully so that they have done a lot of due diligence, and those things are now completed by the way. All the due diligence has been completed. And then, we have a lot of time spent on definitive agreement negotiations. By and large, with the exception of one or two items, were done with that. And then, we have the purchase agreement. And so for me, its been since last Christmas. Its coming up to next Christmas, **so I basically draw the line in the sand and say,** I cant just stop Licensing.  **The business needs to either move in one direction or the other. And then, there are other interested parties who are calling.** We are not entertaining them, because as you recall, during a period of time not long ago in the past, we were in an exclusive discussion with these people. So, I cant really entertain a third party. So, my only point is, if you want to put a weighing percentage, **I put 80:20, I put 80% we get it done this quarter.** Does that help?

&amp;#x200B;

**Also confirmed by Steve Rai (BB CFO) in this interview(**[**here**](https://youtu.be/L_G8gitontI?t=1820)**) that JC plans on announcing by ER one way or the other.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm long and strong blackberry!! I believe this is mispriced and suppressed company worth minimum 10x value today. This is not an investment advice, Please do your own DD before investing and please visit BB investor relations for more info.

So in 2017 the UK government made it easier for new energy companies to enter the market. This shredded CNAs share price form 140GBX to 70GBX

At the start of the pandemic the price dropped to 32GBX and has since recovered to 67GBX

So, CNA are due to report financials in Feb 2022 in the last 3 months 12 have collapsed so far and all but the top 6 are expected to survive. It is very unlikely to see any new entrant into the market now.

The top 6 are inheriting all these new clients on premium energy plans as they arent getting any incentive for transferring. Circa 1200 a year each, so far CNA have taken on over 600,000 new clients in 3 months. Increasing their turnover by 720mil so far

The gas and electricity prices are already shooting through the roof which they make their usual % mark up on the cost price dramatically increased.

Winter is now setting in, today in the warmest part of the UK its 3c, this winter is going to be brutal and prices for the next 3 months arent reducing.

This should all provide a massive boost to CNA share price my target price is 232GBX (400%) return.

Ill start by disclosing the classic : Im a bagholder. Opened a position @16.5$ and averaged down to 14.5$ (yeah still rude).

With that being said, heres why you need to give me a minute. I know a lot of you currently are in PROG and Longeveron dont want to ear or see anything that is not related to a  (idk what kind of animal is a Longeveron and I frankly wont guess). This reminds me of the good old days when some guys were trying to convince the GME apes that AMC was a thing. WSB was a nice mess.

Anyway, I now want to drag your attention on Aptevo.

Market Cap : ~ 60M
Inst Own : 52% 
Shs Float : 4.64M
Target Price : 36$
Current SP : 11.5$

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t

So heres the deal, Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. They just announced a clinical update for the Company's Phase 1b Expansion trial evaluating A***436 in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Preliminary data observed to date includes one complete remission. In other words, they might (insist on might) have a treatment for leukemia. 

Since they released that news the SP went from 6.63$ to 22$ (and now 11.5$, told you Im a Bagholder).

They believe that A***436 (the treatment) has the potential to help AML patients achieve complete remissions without MRD and thereby reduce their risk of leukemic relapses. Aptevo also believes that the use of A***436 for targeting MRD in AML may be associated with a very low risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as well as an increased likelihood of responses as both CRS as well as responses are inversely correlated with the leukemia burden of the patients. If successful, deepening the remission to an MRD-negative remission using this strategy could translate into an improved overall survival in AML.

Heres some facts : 
- Latest figures show that the 5-year survival rate for all subtypes of leukemia is 61.4 percent . A 5-year survival rate looks at how many people are still alive 5 years after their diagnosis. Leukemia is most common in people aged over 55, with the median age of diagnosis being 66.
- Over 382,000 people are living with leukemia, or are in remission. Every day 170 Americans are diagnosed with leukemia and 67 lose the fight. 

This is no financial advice. I bought this stock for one reason. Like a lot of you, I just wanted to make a quick buck before Thanksgiving. Yup... and got caught. 
So Im now holding this stock for two reasons :
1. Im a bagholder.
2. I really want to f* the ones shorting  a Leukemia treatment (no joke, I got some personal issues with Leukemia).

Now what.
And the reason youre still here. Aptevo had a buyout offer at 50$/per shares this year (https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.marketscreener.com/amp/quote/stock/APTEVO-THERAPEUTICS-INC-29774500/news/Tang-Capital-Partners-LP-along-with-Tang-Capital-Management-LLC-cancelled-the-acquisition-of-remai-35679656/)
You do you. 
The SP went from 22$ on Tuesday to 11.5$ on Wednesday. I do not have the Ortex data  for Wednesday yet but Ill post it tomorrow. Without making some useless/baseless comparisons with Longeveron (which could bring me a lot of downvotes and hates), Aptevo is following a similar pattern. As I said, Ill post in here the Ortex data. The SI will (not should, will) be through the roof on Friday/Monday. With a ~4M public float (one of the lowest Ive ever seen) I do think that it is possible to witness some crazy momentum. FYI, Aptevo volume was around 180 M on Tuesday after the news (if I recall correctly). Last time they released an update on treatment was last year and the SP went from 6$ to 60$ in a week.

Well, now the ball is in your court. 
I wish I can predict anything about this stock. I just know that I wont leave until the ones that shorted Leukemia lose everything.
Feel free to comments :))
Also wish everyone a good and happy Thanksgiving!!

however  i came to the realization that this does not change anything and i'd  still be a wageslave after graduating so i had to keep doing smart moves  to retire before i graduate

i  decided from the start that i was too dumb to make 200iq moves to win so  i decided i had to dumb myself down to 10 iq because just being 100 iq  means putting money in SPY or some bullshit

**the first step to this was picking a broker that charged me $9.99 + $1.25/contract on options**

you  might think im a dumbass since this is entirely detrimental but you  would be fucking wrong because the crazy fees stopped me from touching  FDs or anything too short-termed

and this is very important because no sane broker would give a student margin

i didnt even apply for options until i had a positive net worth with my student loans last year because theyd probably reject me

&amp;#x200B;

**the second step is to fuck diversifying**

my portfolio will only have 2 to 3 picks at a time and they would all have nice and round numbers

this  means that if my pick goes up +100% my entire portfolio will actually  go up a lot instead of just going +10% because i only put 5% of my  portfolio into it, this is simple math that even i understand

&amp;#x200B;

**the third step is to fuck shitcoins**

i have to pay taxes if i make gains on shitcoins, wouldnt wanna pay millions in taxes that sounds awful

&amp;#x200B;

**the fourth step is to look for tips online**

im  not smart enough to filter through stock screeners or have any  substantial work experience in any industries to have borderline insider  information, i know im not smart enough to do my own DD but i dont have  to when idiots share theirs for free online holy shit lol

that leaves me to rely on great sources like reddit, yahoo financials, and stocktwits for DD

i also tried 4chan but they only talk about shitcoins there???

&amp;#x200B;

**the result**

well you tell me dumbass

**my story so you can give me more attention:**

i received coronabux cheques from Justin Trudeau last year and i decided it would be smart to invest it after lurking wsb for a longtime, one way or another i somehow made enough to cover all my student loans and future tuition earlier this year

however i came to the realization that this does not change anything and i'd still be a wageslave after graduating so i had to keep doing smart moves to retire before i graduate

&amp;#x200B;

  

Scientists in South Africa are studying a recently identified new coronavirus variant that is a cause for serious concern, stoking fears the country may face a potentially severe fourth wave that could spread internationally.

The new discovery, called B.1.1529 until a Greek letter is assigned, carries an unusually large number of mutations and is clearly very different from previous incarnations, Tulio de Oliveira, a bio-informatics professor who runs gene-sequencing institutions at two South African universities, said at a briefing on Thursday. 

Here is a mutation variant of serious concern, Health Minister Joe Phaahla said at the same media event. We were hopeful that we might have a longer break in between waves -- possibly that it would hold off to late December or even next year January. 

Virologists have detected almost 100 cases linked to the variant in the country to date, said Anne von Gottberg, clinical microbiologist &amp; head of respiratory diseases at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. World Health Organization officials have met to discuss the virus, which has also been detected in Botswana, according to a separate statement.

The new variant is likely to have evolved during a chronic infection of an immuno-compromised person, possibly in an untreated HIV/AIDS patient, Francois Balloux, director of the UCLGenetics Institute, said in a statement published by the Science Media Centre. The worlds biggest number of HIV cases has complicated South Africas efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, as immuno-compromised people can harbor the virus for longer, scientists say.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r1zrv5/rotation_back_into_growthwfh_new_coronavirus/

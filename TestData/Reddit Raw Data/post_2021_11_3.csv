1,"11/03/2021, 23:58:26",All in on Meta,shockwave6969," 

Ill cut to the chase. Im all in on meta. Here is why:

Firstly, Meta is outrageously undervalued in its current state. I dont care if they use unethical targeted ads. Use your data to sell me things. I watched the entire whistleblower hearing and it was silly. Not only was she unable to provide specific documents, but her strongest argument was facebook bad because it makes people feel bad. Government help plz. The government was like yes this is a grave matter indeed. They wont do anything. The public will stop caring. In a month this will blow over into the dustbin of facebooks reputation and the stock will naturally ascend back to the p/e they deserve. If you give them a p/e of 30. The stock will sit right around $400 (current p/e 23).

But thats the boring shit. I really dont care about that. After all, Im ALL IN on this company. The metaverse is not a silly sci-fi idea. Its going to be real very soon, it will accelerate faster than you can imagine, and it will replace reality as you know it. Im about to explain exactly where this is going in the near future and the distant future. This is going to sound very dystopian, which I agree with, but Im not in the stock market to be moral.

**The VR explosion:** Its already happening and its accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and its starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023. 

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moores law to the computer chip. Its been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if its lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

Okay, enough about current data. Where is this really going? Im not sold on it, it seems kinda dumb. 

**The crazy shit:** The metaverse is not the successor to the internet, its the successor to reality. Within the decade we will see the metaverse really take shape, then youll begin to see the vision of where this is going with your own eyes. But if you want a preview, Ill show you. 

1. The metaverse will be an exponential self-sustaining economy that will surpass the GDP of the entire world. Blockchain is a really important part of this. Think of transactions in the metaverse for gaming, like CSGO skins. The skins are represented as NFTs. And are traded on the market. Your skins arent just for your game though. The metaverse is all connected, and you can take your CSGO skin and use it as an item in another game. You can take your genji skin and go to a concert. At the concert the person might sell T-shirts specific to that event which are also represented as NFTs. Businesses will begin to pop up in the metaverse. I already have several ideas, but will not be disclosing them here. Once people realize how easy it is to make money in the metaverse, much like the internet, there will be a mass migration. A gold rush like youve never seen. I could easily see another .com bubble level of excitement. The economy will rapidly grow. And as the metaverse becomes more and more real, it will only accelerate that growth. As more people join the metaverse, more major companies will need to change their business model to enter the metaverse in order to survive. Which will be a feedback loop that grows to unimaginable heights. If you want to get rich, be an early metaverse adopter and start a company that sells a service or product specifically useful for the metaverse. The real economy will transition more and more to the virtual and there will come a day before 2040 when the GDP of the metaverse surpasses that of the real world. And it wont stop there. Whoever runs the metaverse will have an economy larger than the entire world under their thumb.
2. What Meta wont tell you about the metaverse: By the time youve normalized living in the metaverse, you better not care about privacy anymore. I believe the idea of privacy will ultimately be discarded as the price of living. In your headset Meta will track your eye movements, your facial expressions, the way your body physically responds to the sensory input of the virtual world. Whether you like it or not, you are a predictable genetic algorithm. And when billions of data points about your response to input are measured, Meta will be able to build an artificial model of your expected output and know what you want before you want it. You might think, wow thats scary and really good for targeted advertising. And youd be right. But thats just the beginning.
   1. Further future- 2030-2050: Once your being is analyzed as a data model (By an AI like a more powerful version of youtube recommended). At this point in time, AI has reached unprecedented capabilities. AI will build entire worlds for you, filled with things it knows you will enjoy, things youll want to buy, experiences youll want to have. A world far more interesting and exciting than the real one, tailored specifically to you.
   2. But your data will construct something even more bizarre. AI NPCs. Your best friends wont be homo sapiens. Theyll be AI indistinguishable from real people. Perhaps even alive themselves. Generated based on the data of your predictable personality model. Your true love. Someone literally perfect for you, will be an AI. And it will be incredible. You might think, *thats stupid this is stupid Im never going to fall in love with an AI*. You are wrong. And when youre there and the entity is in front of you in the virtual world. When you can touch them, and they can express emotion to you, you will understand. Your utopia is coming.
3. The metaverse will change what it means to be human. It will redefine our understanding of humanity and even gender. In the virtual world, there is no need to be a human. Your avatar can be an animal, a robot, an amoeba, an anime character, literally anything. People will soon feel better represented by your avatar than your real self. And as we cross that threshold the real world will seem more and more lack luster. The real world becomes a boring place where you have to live with this boring body that has to obey the laws of physics. This will further push the transition to the virtual world.
4. The transition from sedentary VR living to immortal consciousness. As people realize how incredible it is to live in the metaverse, the race for immortality will break out more powerfully than the space race. What is the race for immortality? It means to exist as pure data. To upload your consciousness into the metaverse directly, to abandon your feeble human body and live forever exploring the virtual world filled with real people and AI. The ever changing and evolving economy and ecosystem. To travel from universe as you please. If Meta is a part of this transition, then they will own the platform on which your mind exists. They will literally own your body in a sense. Privacy will be so far gone that its a wistful wish of the past, nor will you likely care. Meta will see everything, will know everything you are, everything you could ever want. And they will sell it to you. 
5. The Fermi paradox: where are all the aliens? If there are so many worlds capable of supporting life, if there are quadrillions of planets in the galaxy. If theyve had billions of years to evolve, why dont we see signs of intelligent life in the universe? Why are we alone out here? Its not that intelligent life inherently drives itself to extinction. I highly doubt its that intelligent life is so absurdly rare that we are the only ones. The solution to the Fermi paradox is that there is no reason to ever travel beyond the solar system. A civilization capable of interstellar travel is capable of creating its own universe- unbound by the laws of physics and the vast distances between the stars. A civilization that can shape reality like gods through the virtual world. To exist as pure data consciousness in a network of supercomputers. Humanity will never travel beyond the solar system, not because we will go extinct, but because we will never need to. 

Meta is a company paving the way to redefine the human species, to redefine existence, and to redefine our future. Meta will own the platform upon which our lives exist. This world is terrifying, strange, unbelievable, but also inevitable. And it will be beautiful. It may sound dystopian, but it is, in fact, the opposite. To exist as pure data in the metaverse is the end of death. It is the end of hunger. It is the end of humanity as we know it. On October 28th, 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced itself as a company fully dedicated to the metaverse. A day that will go in the history books as a turning point and the beginning of the new age. The world is changing, and it will only change more and more rapidly. The end is approaching, and so is the beginning. And Im ready to be a part of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlxjs2/all_in_on_meta/

Alright, hear me out. I didnt even know there were already HIMX posts until after this was written. Enjoy it anyway. 

Hopefully we havent forgotten that we want to own companies that are profitable as fuck. I believe this play presents an asymmetric risk. HIMX is trading at 8.6 PE while competitors are trading at 28.57 PE. Fair market value is $25 based on multiples alone. 174.3m free float. Decent amount of SI (26.6m shares sold short) and 99.4% utilization. CTB fee rising. They also are a healthy company that produces a dividend. If a dividend is too boomer for you its because youre poor and Im trying to help change that about you so pay attention.

What do they do: Himax Technologies, Inc., a fabless semiconductor company, provides display imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Europe, and the United States. The company operates through two segments, Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. It offers display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers that are used in televisions, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality devices, and other consumer electronic devices.

The opportunity for additional upside here is that Himax has their hands on the future with virtual reality devices. They have MetaVerse exposure. This is lagging hard compared to other tickers who have recently exploded, and those tickers arent even profitable. FB is expecting to spend in excess of $170bln over the next decade making the metaverse possible. 

Apple is producing its first headset as well - a mixed reality experience that can handle games in high quality virtual reality with snappy chips and high end displays.

Think: Ready Player One

Big tech is investing big money into this space and whether we lack the vision for it or not, its happening. Theyve already created new position titles at their respected companies to get ahead of this curve. Source: trust me bro. This space is going to create an even higher demand for semi conductor companies let alone those who produce micro displays. We are entering the next evolution of the internet.

But dont just listen to me, Fintel claims HIMX to be undervalued and have a high ranking for the company. 90.04 score in their quality metric and 77.9 in value. Recent articles suggest its one of the few Taiwanese tickers to own, presenting value and growth. 


Financials:

For the third quarter, the Company expects further revenue growth from the already high level of Q2 2021. Gross margin shall see another uptick and could reach another quarterly high. With the increases of both revenue and margin, Himax anticipates net profit shall increase substantially in the third quarter. Massive flex, ok.

Third quarter projections: the company is expecting net revenues to increase 13-17%. 

Positions cost distribution: 
26% shareholders are profitable. Sitting on top of a volume shelf looking to move up. 12.3 and 13.94 are the next two largest areas of supply. 

Q2 Total Revenue: 365.26m up 95.43% YoY. 
Q2 Net Income: 108.89 an 7,773.54% increase YoY.
EPS: .62 which is 7,690.00% YoY. The median for its sector is .47. 
ROE: 18.68% which is 5,737.00% YoY. The Semiconductor sector median is 2.79%. 

Those numbers are so good youd think I was tripping on acid. Fact check it. Me being high as balls right now has nothing to do with it. Fuckin seahorse sea hell.

Total debt: HIMX has $159.5m in debt, which is down from $222.4m reported a year ago. They also have $270.4m in cash to offset the debt. This leaves the company $110.9m in net cash. 

Cash flow: 89% of its EBIT 

Dividend: .262
Dividend Yield: 2.53%

Technicals: found hard support at $9.6 and is testing its daily resistance of $11.32. A daily close above this price would present a pivot point. Key areas of resistance past this point would be $14.61 and volume shelf where bag-holders lie waiting, although not many. Institutions are holding at higher prices. 

MACD has crossed, bands are squeezing - havent been this tight since your mom birthed you crotch goblins. We also have a 9EMA/21MA crossover signaling bullish trend reversal. 

Options: call activity has been bullish recently. Recent sweepers into the 11/19 12c. 

TL;DR: future proof conductor company prints hard as fuck right now and in the future. Jan 8c 2022 / 30c 2023 buys you lambo equipped with HIMX shit.

Assuming each TSLA car sold=$1,400,000 in market cap. 2.15 million in car sales would mean TSLA would have market cap bigger than $3T.

The stock would have to just about triple to do that or go from about 1176 to about 2900. If Mr. Muskrat announces that a stock split will occur, the stock would presumably touch $1500.

Assuming TSLA launches cybertruck, we get even more pump. If robotaxi start coming out within that time (even though they were supposed to be here already) the stock literally doubles.

Gigaberlin, Gigachad and Gigamango will also come out pretty quickly. The rising stock price would be used to issue more shares and Tesla will then also own its battery manufacturer too, thus vertically integrating the company.

Assuming 1M robotaxi is here by the end of that time and they perform 10 trips every day, and assuming average revenue from each trip being $20, they will have $73B in revenue from that alone. Also, they are going to issue more shares and buy other boomer production units and going to ramp their production capacity to half the total production capacity of the entire auto industry.

Imagine that! Also, they are going to decimate oil and gas companies and steal a lot of their market share, if they steal 10% market share from them that would be worth $160B in revenue at least. Granted the margin will be pretty low but this will position them better for the future.

We are not going to talk about the positive impacts of the extreme amount of short dated OTM call options and the feedback loop it creates by gamma hedging, granted it may also reverse but we are not going to count that.

If you think TSLA cult investors are going to not diamond hand, you are an idiot. They will never back out from this stock in the first sign of a marketwide panic and instead they are going to sell their other positions and buy into TSLA to finally get in on the ride!

I believe even touching $5T within the next month is not too difficult, you might disagree, but let's agree to disagree.

Not to mention SpaceX is going to Mars, Neuralink and other stuff that may or may not be related to TSLA but this will surely make us all rich and we will then buy Tesla cars using our trading profits, thus creating a money creation glitch.

What do you all think?

Basically I read a few articles and heard a rumor that lead me to believe Tesla could acquire a small(er) car insurance company called Metromile (MILE).

Reasoning
-Tesla's are notoriously expensive to insure
-Tesla is testing the auto insurance waters
-Ex-Tesla exec on the board at MILE
-MILE essentially wrote a letter to Elon on their blog

We all loved the GME and AMC Short squeeze, and that squeeze got me thinking. Hedge funds/ Big Money short stocks and make money from the stock going down. I started to think about how can I make money like Wall Street? and I have come up with this trading strategy let me know what you think! 

Shorting a stock in a dumbed-down version is:

You Borrow X amount of share of a stock and you sell it at market value, after x amount of time you return the shares. If the price of the stock drops you make money if it goes up you lose money its the opposite of normal trading. For Example, you borrow 100 shares at $10 and the price drops to $5 you made a profit of $500 - fees.

My Idea:

I have been looking at a stock screener FINVIZ.com is what I use and they have an indicator called ""Top Gainers"". Pick a ticker from that list around 10 am EST and watch it hit its peak which happens around 10 am-12 pm EST once the stock hits its peak short it and hold the short till the end of the day to avoid paying interest on the short or hold it for 1 day up to you. From the data, I have gathered this is what I see I will provide a few examples

Let's look at each stock I posted and remember these stocks were ""Top Gainers"" on the day 

let's look at the stocks:

OLB: It hit a peak of $11.77 at 12 pm EST close to my time range that I said 10 am -12 pm if you shorted the stock at its peak and hold the short for 1 day and sell at the end of the day (lowest peak) $6.51 that is a gain of $5.26 per share. (Remember these are the best numbers for the day) 

DBGI: It hit a peak of $5.42 at 10 am EST close to my time range that I said 10 am -12 pm if you shorted the stock at its peak and hold the short for 1 day and sell at the end of the day (lowest peak) $3.62 that is a gain of $1.83 per share. (Remember these are the best numbers for the day) 

CAR: It hit a peak of $534.06 at 11 am EST close to my time range that I said 10 am -12 pm if you shorted the stock at its peak and hold the short for 1 day and sell at the end of the day (lowest peak) $300.9 that is a gain of $233.16 per share. (Remember these are the best numbers for the day) 

AGRI: It hit a peak of $3.55 at 10:30 am EST close to my time range that I said 10 am -12 pm if you shorted the stock at its peak and hold the short for 5 days and sold at the end of the day today (lowest peak) $2.48 that is a gain of $1.07 per share. (Remember these are the best numbers for the day) 

This happens day after day where all these stocks have an amazing day then they come crashing down. Yes, they might have an amazing week and keep rising but what are the odds you can win the Powerball faster.

Here is a list of the top gainers today watch them hit a peak and fall. short them and make a lot of money. Remember Stocks only go up so be safe. 

   
 

By the end of the day today or tomorrow they will fall and if you short them you may make some money (I wouldn't short BBBY because you degenerates buy into this so who knows it might moon)

But hey I am just a 21-year-old moron who lost 50% of what I put into the market because I thought they will keep going up so I'm trying the opposite short the stock I think will go out and profit from them falling like they always do. Do this at your own risk no way this works but you can hope you will have better luck using a random stock generator and buying into that but who know I might be onto something let me know what you think

This happens day after day where all these stocks have an amazing day then they come crashing down. Yes, they might have an amazing week and keep rising but what are the odds you can win the Powerball faster.

Here is a list of the top gainers today watch them hit a peak and fall. short them and make a lot of money. Remember Stocks only go up so be safe.

By the end of the day today or tomorrow they will fall and if you short them you may make some money (I wouldn't short BBBY because you degenerates buy into this so who knows it might moon)

But hey I am just a 21-year-old moron who lost 50% of what I put into the market because I thought they will keep going up so I'm trying the opposite short the stock I think will go out and profit from them falling like they always do. Do this at your own risk no way this works but you can hope you will have better luck using a random stock generator and buying into that but who know I might be onto something let me know what you think

1,"11/03/2021, 22:28:28",ETON poised for blast off with FDA approval,TheGameIsAboutGlory1,"Ok retards, gather 'round the fire and listen to Grandpa tell you all about the wonders of swallowing...

So there's this condition called Dysphagia. It causes people to have severe difficulty swallowing. So what's the current treatment for it? You guessed it...pills and tablets. You know, large things you have to fucking swallow. This is where ETON comes in. They're about to get full FDA approval this weekend for Topiramate, which is a liquid. This addresses two huge issues:

1) People with dysphagia have a much easier time swallowing liquid than they do a big pill.

2) A major issue that's been cited with the pill is that this condition responds much better to very precise doses. The pill is just whatever dose it is. With a liquid, you can take the precise amount that is best for you.

This will be the first and only form of liquid treatment for this condition, and they have it patented. Additionally, it also treats tonic-clonic seizures in patients two years and older, as well as being a preventative treatment for migraines in patients 12 and older.

The market for the oral topiramate is roughly $800m annually. Sound good? Yea, it gets better. ETON is currently around $6.50 per share, which puts its market cap at $161m. That's right, the annual sales projection is five times the current market cap. Options are still pretty cheap, even after a decent run up over the past month. The medium analyst target for ETON is $12. Yup, the *median* target is almost double the current price. When ETON gets full FDA approval this weekend, the stock is going to explode.

*""Nov 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co* [*(JPM.N)*](https://www.reuters.com/companies/JPM.N) *has  told prime brokerage clients it will no longer let them buy certain  U.S. cannabis-related securities beginning Nov. 8, according to a letter  seen by Reuters.*

*The  saga drew regulatory scrutiny and prompted banks across Wall Street to  review how much risk they are prepared to take on in their prime  brokerage businesses.""*

To me, this is a clear signal that something very big is about to happen in this space.

**UP OR DOWN?**

Being  that cannabis is about 70% off its highs from earlier this year, I  struggle with how we can go much lower especially with every analyst PT well above our current levels.

Its currently November and we have a must pass NDAA that has cannabis banking reform worked in through the SAFE banking act.

Banking  has long been viewed as the ultimate catalyst for this sector. There is  a ton of money that wants to invest but is not allowed to enter due to  federal regulations. JPM solidifies this statement with today's move.

There  has been a lot of discussion as to whether or not SAFE banking would  make it into the final NDAA. Schumer recently stated that he has no  issues with safe banking, assuming he can get broad reform attached and  social equity included.

Just last  weekend, minority owned cannabis businesses pleaded with federal  regulators to pass SAFE banking into the NDAA as social equity is  already being worked into many state regulations, and not having access  to a bank account is a much larger threat to their businesses.

I  feel there is enough momentum on both sides to see this through in  2021. GOP states are scrambling to add legalization legislation. Schumer  will read the room and either get broader reform (legalization) into  the NDAA or he will allow SAFE banking to pass as its absolutely  necessary.

**WHO DOES THIS HURT?**

Right now, any cannabis stock not operating on the Nasdaq, TSX or NYSE.

In short, multi-state operators (MSO's) are about to get fucked really hard.

They  are going to lose access to shareholder capital and this will really  slow their ability to scale against global competitors.

**WHO DOES THIS BENEFIT?**

Mother fucking Tilray.

MSO's in need of capital will now need to look towards companies like Tilray when they're in a pinch and need a bailout.

Flush  with cash and a 4B/y revenue plan through acquisitions, I expect Tilray  to take advantage of this opportunity in a big way.

Additionally,  this should condense a very large investor pool down to the few  companies that have been able to gain access to the NYSE and the Nasdaq  creating a massive funnel to the likes of TLRY, CGC and (fuck me) ACB.

**HOW DOES** ***~~CITADEL~~*** **ARCHEGOS FACTOR IN?**

This is a preemptive move by JPM because they do not want to become the next credit suisse and get ass rammed by guys like *~~Ken Griffen~~* Bill Hwang and the fuckboys at *~~Citadel~~* Archegos.

**TILRAY, CITADEL and THE CORRELATION IN MEME STOCKS**

I  have been trading TLRY since november of last year following the  announcement of the APHA merger. I was long in APHA prior to the news  drop and shifted into TLRY shortly thereafter.

Anyone who spends their days with their eyes glued to memes can tell you there is absolutely a correlation in them all.

I believe, as many of you do, that this correlation comes from Citadel.

Tilray is currently the only cannabis company they have any exposure too, both short and long.

Why is this? CGC is the preferred hedge cunt play so why is TLRY their only cannastock?

***Because of GME. Because of AMC. Because retail cant fucking win.***

Following  the squeeze in GME many other short plays made massive moves. Tilray  was one of them, going all the way from 6 to 65 in just 4 months.

We  know that Citadel has a reputation of some seriously dank skulduggery  so we can assume that it was them who has been running the short ladder  from 65 all the way down to our current level of 10.50.

This  wouldn't have been all to difficult considering the TLRY float is 85%  owned by retail traders, they have the ability to short dark pools and they sell shares they do not own across multiple foreign exchanges (TSX and Frankfurt).

Using AI to trade in dark pools over multiple exchanges give them the ability to basket  memes and control losses where they have over exposed themselves by selling shares that dont actually exist.

The Tilray float prior to its merger with APHA was tiny, this is why I dumped APHA for TLRY following the merge news.

Combining  the two floats gave Citadel an opportunity to hide positions and  control the narrative. Being that this stock is owned mostly by retail  and most those retail cunts being us, they really couldn't help  themselves.

TLDR;

Knowing that citadel is just as long as they are short and understanding that  broad reform is right around the corner, it is my belief that JPM  believes a massive move to the upside is getting ready to happen in ALL  of cannabis and they want to minimize the risk should citadel or any  other bad actor decide to run cannabis to insane valuations such as Archegos did with DISCA and VIAC.

IF Citadel loses their battle with MEME's this could be their only out, which is why its their only long in the space.

With most investors in Cannabis being retail, JPM surely cant be protecting themselves from us. 

When we lose they take our house, no big deal. 

When someone like Archegos or Citadel loses, everyone loses their house and its a very big deal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlvl1r/jpm_cannabis_and_the_mso_shill_the_case_for/

1,"11/03/2021, 22:22:21",$GWH: Electrifying Your Portfolio with a Low Float Play,Poseidon17172,"repost from u/haten4life

Alright degenerates I got some sweet DD that will catapult your portfolio into the stratosphere. Now I know you Apes don't like to read so I'll keep this short. Since DWAC has revived interests in SPAC plays Ive been on the hunt for the next potential play. Now this is a low Float and high Redemption play. Right now due share lock up and the recent business combination the shares available to trade right now are only around 4.2 Million.

&amp;#x200B;

Float Information from latest 8-k

GWH spiked initially after the news of its completed business combination was published on CNBC. And with it being a Green Energy Company backed by Bill Gates there was a lot of coverage. Though after a few days Retail interest seems to have waned in the stock. But it's still capable of running even higher as most De-SPAC plays with high redemption tend to do. There's a golden period within 30 days of a SPAC Play being publicly listed before pipe shares get dumped. Thats its extremely susceptible to volatile movements due to the low float. And with options makes it even more interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

Since usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $GWH is far below that, but before redemptions it wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook. Now there isnt a gamma or anything like that. This play is solely based on the fact it is a high redemption play with low float that tend to have volatile movements and with options added makes it much more likely. Especially within the first 30 days of its spike as it has happened in these similar plays. Now this doesnt mean the same thing will happen here but the possible volatile movement is the play. I believe the run up isn't done just yet and could go for another All time high. As most previous plays with the same set up have but its up to you to decide how to play this for yourself.

If this play follows the pattern of previous high redemption, low float plays it might reach a new All Time High!

Edit: addition information thanks xxChristianBale

**40k+ call open interest**. That's just eyeballing it, but that's equal to or greater than the entire float, and most concentrated near the current price.

1,"11/03/2021, 22:20:22",$CRCT 49.4% Short Float - Massive Potential Upside,ArchDrew,"**Disclaimer**: None of this is financial advice and the below is my personal opinion based on my DD.

**Summary for you lazy degenerates**: The stock may have the largest Shrek Dick candle you have ever seen (Not Financial Advice and my own option)

**About the Company**: Cricut (CRCT) sells machines, supplies, and software for an all-in one DIY product that you can literally make anything with (Labels, Stencils, Stickers, Physical 3D projects, etc) This is an essential product for crafters and small to medium sized businesses. Everyone is quitting their job to become an entrepreneur and this product may be a must have for those degenerates.

**Thesis**: $CRCT as of 11/02/2021 has a short float of **\~49.4%**. This means that out of all shares currently available to the public, close to half of it is shorted. This has the potential for a major short squeeze. See below from Bloomberg for support:

**Year-over-Year Growth**: 

This company actually makes money compared to the stocks you other retards buy. Per the IPO Investment Prospectus filed with the SEC 

([Cricut, Inc. IPO Investment Prospectus S-1/A (sec.report)](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-014464/)) Cricut had a whopping 463% increase in Net Income since 2018.

 **Bull Case**:

 Short Squeeze potential due to high short interest

 The company actually makes money and has potential for growth

**Bear Case:** None, this literally cannot go tits up if youre long (Not Financial Advice)

Then project a reduction in the 1.3 beta it currently has, and you will see continued re-rating over time, even as growth slows in the longer run.  

If you missed the TSLA run, it's because you don't have the ability to project future growth, and only rely on numbers that are currently in front of you.  You're a peasant meant to be ruled over by greater men.

This thing has been heavily shorted, look at the YTD chart and the market cap. There is so much room for this thing to rocket. Being only $2.5 away is also easy af to hit given cost of entry is low.

Also as of today there is 5.5 days to cover so a $2+ jump in price is easily achievable here.

I liked it back then since it was simple to enter and exit options. However, after what happened back in January and trying out other apps, I found I could live without the nice-looking UI. At that time, it seemed like I had to pick between a great UI OR a great broker. With RH, you're practically trading blind.

[Lantern](https://uselantern.com/) offers great options flow and amazing insights like hot contracts, put-call ratios, news, all greeks, IV plotted options pricing and actual versus theoretical options prices. You could just log in to mobile or desktop to log in. Open your email and GME on these applications, and leave them open all day, tabbing in all you want with the charts. And oh, I'm sure the chart gets a lot of attention. GME is, without a doubt, their most-watched chart. 

I admit, RH still does have the best interface out there but it doesn't matter when you, the user, are getting screwed over and over. 

Also, as a final thought, Brokerages really should improve their user experience especially for degenerates like me lol, they should have full-fledged gamification of their UI.

1,"11/03/2021, 21:11:05",$YPF The largest oil company in Argentina,Competitive-Still294,"Surely the majority of you never listen about YPF, but is the biggest oil company in Argentina (includes upstream, midstream and downstream operations)

 Usually, I never post about argentinian stocks (which I think have a lot of potential), but risk/reward ratio for $YPF at this point is very worth.

Today, Pablo Gonzalez (YPF CEO's) told on an interview for a local newspapper that ***next ER will show the third consecutive quarter with more than USD 1B on EBITDA***

 [https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202111/573524-recuperacion-productiva-ypf-inversion.html](https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202111/573524-recuperacion-productiva-ypf-inversion.html) 

 FYI, YPF market cap is just USD1,64B... So, at this point ***$YPF is trading below x1 MARKETCAP/EBITDA***

***YPF is also trading at P/BV of x0,2***... Yes 0,2. Im not joking or making a typing mistake

Only his tower in one of the most wealthy  neighborhoods of Buenos Aires (Puerto Madero) is worth 25% of his market cap 

 

But for me the real catalyst for YPF is that once elections finish (14th November), Government will authorize an increase on gas prices (which are very low as a populist measure). They are holding it to retain as votes as possible.

Argentina is already dealing with IMF for a debt restructuring. I'm very confident that they will reach an agreement, but I don't know if it will happen in the short term

In summary:

* CEO broke quiet period and slide some insides about next ER (will present 10 November)
* Government will increase oil and gas prices soon
* Ridiculously cheap from a fundamental/financial side.
* IMF negotiations

Technical Analysis (looking great too)

If Oil doesnt crash, YPF can easily go to 7,25. With a SL at 4, you are risking 4% for a potential gain of 74%

I'm also adding a comparison vs Brent

Numbers: Avis reported earnings per share of $10.74, which was more than double what analysts had projected. Revenue was also strong.

Catalyst: During the earnings call, CEO Joe Ferraro reportedly made an unclear comment about the company being active with electric cars, but didnt offer specifics. Investors took the bait on Tuesday.

Short Squeeze: Analysts also say that there was likely a short squeeze on Tuesday, with investors betting against Avis. That might explain the huge increase.

Stoppage: There was so much buying that the stock was halted several times on Tuesday.

Final Thoughts: Also on Tuesday, Elon Musk said that Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) has not signed the contract with Hertz to sell them electric cars.

Since Bcoin has a bearish stint, a lot of miners were shorted, however, a lot do them are having gamma squeezes because Bcoin is on an ATH bull run. 

This stock however has the most shorts of all time. Its squeezed many times before, however, they were only miniature squeezes that didnt have Bcoin backing it and WSB backing it. 

I understand a lot of you have lost your shirt investing in stocks like BB or WISH, however, I do believe this stock has a lot of potential regardless of short interest rate.

*****

# [Dow futures are slightly lower ahead of the Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt;U.S. stock futures were muted in morning trading Wednesday as investors awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on its move to start withdrawing the support it has been providing.
*****
&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 51 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were about flat and Nasdaq 100 futures rose slightly. All three major averages closed at record highs on Tuesday.
*****
&gt;Lyft jumped nearly 13% in after hours trading on better-than-expected third-quarter results. Zillow fell more than 11% after announcing it will close its home buying and flipping business. Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond rose on a partnership announcement with Kroger but the nearly 70% after hours surge that followed was likely fueled by a short squeeze.
*****
&gt;Activision shares tumbled, falling nearly 12% after it said the launch of two games would be delayed. The company also issued a weaker holiday outlook thought it did beat profit estimates for the quarter.
*****
&gt;Investors are focused on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce the timeline for a gradual reduction in its bond-buying program Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day meeting. Theyll also be listening for clues on when the central bank plans to raise interest rates.
*****
&gt;Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to stress that the reduction process known as tapering does not equate to tightening policy. Traders are pricing in a more aggressive path of interest rate hikes than the Fed is anticipating, so Powell may try to talk the market down.
*****
&gt;However, the Fed also will have to show that it is not ignoring the rise in inflation that has taken price increases to their fastest in 30 years.
*****
&gt;With the S&amp;P 500 up 13 days in the past 15 ahead of the Fed beginning the process of draining the punch bowl, there certainly is a lot of confidence that strong earnings will overcome everything, said Peter Boockvar, Bleakley Advisory Groups CIO. That said, global monetary tightening is taking place, not just with the Fed, and that should not be ignored either.
*****
&gt;Equities rose Tuesday as companies continued to deliver strong earnings reports. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far this earnings season, 83% of them have beat consensus expectations, according to FactSet. Thats despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, commodity inflation, central bank policy and Covid risk.
*****
&gt;Stocks are like the Energizer Bunny, as they continue to soar to new highs and show no signs of tiring, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. We understand all of the worries out there, but the bottom line is earnings continue to come in way better than expected and are helping to justify stocks are current levels.
*****
&gt;In regular trading on Tuesday, the Dow rose 138.79 points to 36,052.63. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%. All three major averages closed at records for the third session in a row. The small cap Russell 2000 rose slightly and closed at an all-time high.
*****
&gt;Those highs are making a potential year-end rally more conceivable to investors.
*****
&gt;The primary market trend appears higher, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist. In the eight periods since 1950 where stocks were up more than 20% through October, as they are this year, the S&amp;P 500 tacked on additional gains by year end 100% of the time with an average gain of 6.2%.
*****
&gt;Investors also will get a look at the jobs market when payrolls processing firm ADP releases its report on private employment at 8:15 a.m. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the report to show that companies added 395,000 positions for October.

1,"11/03/2021, 20:29:29",Huge potential for BNTX: about to beat earnings again plus new data on cancer trials upcoming,starsnpixel,"I want to give you some insight on BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX), a German biotechnology company that - especially in the US - often stays in the shadow behind Pfizer when speaking about Covid vaccines. Currently trading at about $295, I am super bullish for this company, both in the short-term as well as long.

Looking at the chart, BNTX just finished its consolidation and is now back in a uptrend. When the resistances at $300 and $330 are broken (300 probably today), there's a lot upside potential as two major catalysts are approaching next week: Q3 ER and its participation at a oncology congress. Let's look at the two separately, as well as an outlook.

\-- As usually: I am by no means a financial expert, please do your own DD. --

**Q3 ER**  
In the last quarters, BioNTech showed a pattern of crushing it's earnings estimations and after Pfizer topped its estimations significantly yesterday, so will BioNTech as they share profits 50:50. As a result, alone from this we could/should get close to the ATH of $464 (reached shortly after the great Q2 ER) until ER on Nov 9. But this is not a short-term exaggeration if you look at the fundamentals: The market cap is currently at about $66B with the **currently** estimated EPS of $42 in 2021 and about the same for 2022 ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNTX/analysis/?guccounter=1)). This leads to a current price-earnings ratio of only 7 while the competitor Moderna (ticker: MRNA) is at 12 ([source](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mrna/price-earnings-peg-ratios)). For BNTX, a value of 12 would mean a share price of $500 and this doesn't even take into account BioNTech's better pipeline (see below)!

**Presentations at 36th SITC Annual Meeting (oncology congress)**  
Covid is obviously a major topic and will continue to be but some criticize that BNTX's vaccine is the only product they have on the market currently. Some background on the company: originally, BNTX was founded with the aim to fight cancer using mRNA technology, the Covid vaccine was more of a side product by utilization of the deep knowledge they had gained in this area over time. Thus progress in their oncology programs would be a big win, both for humanity as well as for the share price. On October 1, BNTX announced that they will be presenting new data on four of their oncology programs at the SITC Annual Meeting November 10 - 14, some of them phase 1/2 in-human studies. Furthermore ""*The data we will be presenting at SITC 2021 is indicative of our continued pursuit of pathbreaking science and the development of our  platform technologies that tailor anti-cancer therapies to individual patient needs, said zlem Treci, M.D., Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at BioNTech. We are encouraged by the considerable progress within our oncology portfolio seeing multiple programs now coming to fruition. They represent critical steps for us towards bringing cancer immunotherapy into the next generation and we are looking forward to sharing the data with the scientific community at a key conference.* ([source](https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-present-new-clinical-and-preclinical-data-across))   
To me, it's hard to miss the excitement between the lines - ""encouraged by the considerable progress"", ""coming to fruition"", ""looking forward to sharing the data"", ... Also, I don't think they would be participating if the data wasn't good.   
Good news in this matter just days after beating earnings estimations and on top of a possible ATH (or close to it) would blow all boundaries, I think. And that's without the shorts that will be grilled on the way. However, I don't like the excessive use of rocket emojis, so I'll spare them here.

**Long-term outlook**  
Beyond all this short-term excitement, BNTX is also a great hold for the long-term future. Uur ahin, BioNTech' CEO, when asked about the future of mRNA pharmaceuticals, explained: ""*The first approved products are already here. The next drug could come in the next year and a half. Then, two or three more will arrive, then five, then 10. And then it will skyrocket. I predict that in 15 years, one-third of all newly approved drugs will be based on mRNA technology.*"" ([source](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/biontech-ceo-ugur-sahin-on-mrna-technology-we-have-opened-the-door-to-a-new-world-of-pharmaceuticals-a-2d732976-8796-4305-88b8-5a0fb915f553)) The massive profits due to the Covid vaccine success lead to huge possibilities for more R&amp;D projects and I am convinced this will allow BNTX to expand its position as the current and future market leader dramatically.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qltdr6/huge_potential_for_bntx_about_to_beat_earnings/

1,"11/03/2021, 20:26:45","More BBBY DD, why I bought at 13.67, and why I'm not selling at $26",Diamondhandsforever,"Seen a couple of posts this morning on BBBY with some DD, but wanted to elaborate on this overnight sensation year in the making.

To begin here is a snapshot of my position (500 shares) price was last night after hours. 

https://preview.redd.it/qp4ym3n8ddx71.png?width=454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=394cf245c22907c1df8c975073290489b932b9ec

First and foremost, I believe the company is fundamentally undervalued. At my time of purchase, their market cap was close to 1.3 Billion and the Price to Book was around 1.5. Their forward P/E was sitting around 15 at the time of purchase. For context, Macy's went bankrupt, went up 5X since the bottom, and has a market cap close to 9 Billion dollars. 

One DD mentioned they announced a buyback program last night, that's not quite accurate, that was previously announced and all they did last night was further accelerate the program. I love share buybacks as much as the street does, increases demand, and limits supply.

Finally, the shorts, while there is some conflicting information of what % the float is short (seen as low as 30% and high as 70%) there is clearly enough short interest to create that dirty banned word that we must no longer say. It rhymes with Port Sneeze.

These shorts aren't all closed, just by the move overnight, not by a long shot.

https://preview.redd.it/1fopry4ugdx71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e97b4c2821f8355baeb26f00cef90fd782c047

Where do you think institutions began their squeeze? There was no time to squeeze in the yellow box, that was a drop after earnings, while some people must have shorted after earnings and used low 20s as a stop loss, I believe the majority of shorts would have occured during the chop in the red box over a longer period of time, and I believe their stops would have to be in the low to mid-30s.

Finally, my wife's boyfriend wears their cologne, and as much as it pains me to admit, it does smell really nice.

**TLDR: I like the stock, fuck them shorts, APES TOGETHER STRONG.**

Im hella long.

Last point before we get into the details of the post: Adrian doxxed me several days ago in an attempt to intimidate me, but all it did was motivate me. Am I a retarded degenerate? Maybe even a SAVAge Ape? Most likely.

Doxxing me only proved that I am who I say I am- a retarded Associated Professor of Internal Medicine with 13 years of clinical experience treating Alzheimer's patients in the hospital. Half the FUD you spread backfires. Your attempts at making new profiles and directly messaging me telling me how to frame my arguments wreak desperation. Your personal attacks will always be redirected to the content of my posts. Assessing my motives will not get you anywhere either. So bring it. Add fuel to the fire!

I love eating green crayons, and I'm as stubborn as they come.

I and several cosigners/co-authors will be submitting a citizen's petition to the FDA. Below I share the general content I will be submitting. I believe there is enough data to approve Simufilam with post-marketing surveillance with my fellow Redditors.

The actual submission to the FDA will not contain personal or unnecessary information that has been added for context and clarity for a non-scientific audience.

**TLDR: It is my opinion based on my risk-benefit analysis: Simufilam (SAVA's Alzheimer's drug) must receive accelerated approval and move to phase 4 post-marketing surveillance.**

1. **Severely unmet medical need. Every year 120,000 AD patients die with no effective treatment.**
2. **Simufilam (SAVA's AD drug) has been dosed 149,120 with no documented severe adverse effects. (Some adverse events may present as the number of doses are increased). Still, Simufilam has an excellent safety profile based on the current data.**
3. **Publically available data showing improvement across 34 measures of AD.**
4. **The FDA has acted on similar data in the past to fast-track medications to market.**
5. **If the FDA rejects my petition, I believe Phase 3 and CMS trials will be used to advance Simufilam to market based on Simufilam's six-month interim analysis of the respective trials.**
6. **I am not affiliated with SAVA as an employee, contractor, or any other way except that I am a long investor. I plan to hold my investment as long as the data remains consistent. I may consider hedging before the eventual binary outcome. This is not medical or financial advice. It is only the ramblings of a retarded deluded mega bull who has been wrong plenty of times in the past. Do your own due diligence.**

https://preview.redd.it/cjv294mqadx71.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a36433bd623865b90e27563d3b42093efd0a67e6

Artist William Utermohlen was diagnosed with AD (Alzheimer's disease) in 1995. In the figure above, he painted what he saw in the mirror. As we can see from his last painting in 2000, he spent the final seven years of his life incapable of seeing the world, effectively blind. He died in 2007.

This view of AD from a patient perspective is tragic and touching. It elicits anxiety for those of us with sound minds. What's it like to look into the mirror, unable to see one's own face for seven years? What else are they unable to see?

I practice at one of the largest community hospitals in the southeast. As you know, for every 1000 medicare patient days in the hospital, 538 are associated with AD. AD is predictive of an extended and complex hospital stay with increased odds of death (compared to patients who do not have AD).

**1) Overwhelming Public Need**

I have witnessed numerous families bring their elderly father or mother to the ER, saying, ""we cannot take care of him/her."" Not because they are forgetful, but because they are easily agitated and turn aggressive. These families do not ask, ""is there a treatment?"". They have already navigated a complex medical system and know AD is terminal with no effective treatment. Heart attacks, strokes, sepsis, and other diseases seen in hospitals have a myriad of treatments. AD does not. AD is the sixth leading cause, and by some estimates, it is the third leading cause of death. See ""[2021 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FACTS AND FIGURES](https://www.alz.org/media/documents/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf)""

As a patient advocate, I elected to present anecdotal data to contextualize and humanize the numerous awful statistics we all know too well.

I review these weighty problems with the FDA to help frame my logic and construct a petition for why Simufilam must be expediently granted accelerated approval and advanced to phase 4 post-marketing surveillance.

After reviewing the FDA's mission statement, I am operating on the premise that the FDA evaluates medications based on **risk benefits**.

1. There is an overwhelming and urgent need (discussed above)
2. Simufilam's safety data is unblemished. (**The risk**)
3. The cognitive data, by my judgment, is a treatment effect, not placebo. (**The benefit**).

**2) Safety Data:**

Simufilam has been administered to patients across 5 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03748706, NCT04079803, NCT04932655, NCT04388254, NCT04388254).

More precisely, 39,620 doses of Simufilam were administered from the publicly available data, with no reported serious *adverse* events. Further, Patients tolerated Simufilam well, as is evident by the low attrition rate.

In addition, there are 150 patients enrolled in the ""open-label extension trial"" (OLE). They do not have publicly available information; however, it is reasonable to assume the FDA is privy to safety data. The standard protocol requires study sites to report serious adverse events immediately to the FDA. Those OLE patients were administered another 109,500 doses.

Factoring in the OLE patients, in totality, **149,120** doses were administered without **serious** safety events across multiple trials.

**3) The data:**

Data associated with Simufilam has been remarkably consistent.

A 28 day multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 64 patients measured:

1. Abeta42
2. Total Tau
3. P-tau181
4. Neurogranin
5. Neurofilament Light Chain
6. YKL-40
7. Paired Associates Learning Test
8. Spatial Working Memory Test
9. IL-6
10. sTREM2
11. HMGB1
12. Albumin
13. IgG
14. Filamin A Linkages to alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor
15. Toll-like Receptor 4 in Subject Lymphocytes
16. Plasma P-tau181
17. SavaDx

Cassava Sciences stated:

*""98% of patients treated with Sumifilam 50 mg or 100 mg b.i.d. for 28 days showed improvements in validated biomarkers of AD pathology; neuroinflammation; and neurodegeneration; with no safety issues.""*

Open-label Extension data tested:

1. P-tau
2. Total Tau
3. Abeta42
4. Neurofilament light chain
5. Neurogranin
6. YKL-40
7. Soluble TREM2
8. HMGB1
9. ADAS cog-11 (reported at 6, 9, and 12 months)
10. NPI (reported at 6, 9, and 12 months)
11. SavaDx

Tallied up, we have 34 different measures over twelve months and twenty-eight days.

Now, let us focus on the data which is clinically the most relevant-ADAS cog, and NPI.

A valid criticism of the twelve-month OLE data is that it is open-label, susceptible to placebo effect. However, a more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect highly probable and Placebo effect unlikely.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6rdzehrsadx71.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1edc5751ea2060a4f82d44750bc04ad7fda22c65

A [meta-analysis](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jalz.2009.05.665) published by Ito et al. looked at placebo response data in 19,972 patients between 1990 and 2008. The disease progression in mild to moderate AD patients was estimated at 5.5 points per year.

The disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a [follow-up analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23803296/), Ito et al. also highlight that the placebo response tends to be more significant in the first few months.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2qri0hgwadx71.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ce1e069b24a4441d0055491a8bef35141f9f9d4

A follow-up meta-analysis by [Zhang et al](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-00630-5). also looked at placebo response data in 19,210 patients between 1992 and 2019. The disease progression rate was estimated as 5.82 points per year, although this varied depending on region, age, and baseline ADAS-Cog scores. It's also suggested that placebo effect plateaus at approximately 16 weeks in clinical trials.

Simufilams ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/doyien3zadx71.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d3440b19d459471eaebdf1579ac343f77314cfd

The data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable. Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. So, if a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-cog at twelve months or greater, this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature. We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below.

Taking a closer look at the delta between the above cohorts and the OLE ADAS-cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. By my estimation, this can not be explained by placebo.

Suppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes phase three a foregone conclusion, in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vyfk05f2bdx71.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af6fcbd5c64fdd667b390938c598703aa7e22d96

As mentioned above, behavioral disturbances are the explicit reason families abandon their loved ones in the ER. Caregiver stress is cited in ""Alzheimer's facts and figures"" as having numerous unfavorable outcomes. Worse, physicians are often forced to use antipsychotics for dementia-related psychosis and agitation, which increases the risk of death in the elderly. Restraints (a generous way of referring to tying patients to the bed) are an unfortunate last resort used in the hospital setting to prevent patients from harming themselves and staff. Simufilam use resulted in markedly fewer behavior disturbances, and this data continues to improve with time.

Fast-tracking a medication after a single-arm study would not be an unprecedented action by the FDA. As Ke Liu, MD, PhD cites [here.](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/presentation/presentation-us-fda-expedited-programs-expanded-access-ke-liu_en.pdf)

As is known, the cognitive data was collected over sixteen clinical sites across the US and Canada by independent Physician PI's and associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). The chain of custody was made transparent and verified by independent biostatisticians.

AD claims the lives of 13 patients every hour, and if the FDA allows phase three trials to continue for two years, then we risk the deaths of over 240,000 patients. As functional status is an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality. I believe by preserving cognitive function, Simufilam will also preserve functional status (as the two are highly correlated). It may take years to see a mortality benefit, but waiting years in the setting of limited risk is unacceptable.

I and my cosigners are humbly and optimistically submitting this Citizens Petition to review m my risk-benefit analysis. I look forward to the FDA's correspondence.

Hope everyone is doing well!

$PINS is reporting earnings tomorrow and I'm curious to see how some of you are going to play it out. 

Of course everyone was aware of the news around PayPal acquiring them and in the end it turned out it was just a rumor. Some say that was based on Pinterest's announcement of enabling sellers to upload images and catalogues and offering them directly to an online audience. 

The expansion into online shopping is what makes Pinterest attractive to PayPal and the other digital payment companies. A number of analysts say they expect the tie-ups within e-commerce/social media companies and digital payment giants to grow in the future. 

The bad news around PINS is that the co-founder Evan Sharp is stepping down from the company and has sold all of his shares in the month of October. According to Finviz, a number of other insiders has been selling stock recently as well. 

The other bad news is that Pinterest reported it had lost 42 million active monthly users as we are moving out from the pandemic.

Im hella long. 

Last point before we get into the details of the post:  Adrian doxxed me several days ago in an attempt to intimidate me, but all it did was motivate me. Am I a retarded degenerate? Maybe even a SAVAge Ape?  Most likely. 

Doxxing me only proved that I am who I say I am- a retarded Associated Professor of Internal Medicine with 13 years of clinical experience treating Alzheimer's patients in the hospital. Half the FUD you spread backfires. Your attempts at making new profiles and directly messaging me telling me how to frame my arguments wreak desperation. Your personal attacks will always be redirected to the content of my posts. Assessing my motives will not get you anywhere either.  So bring it. Add fuel to the fire!  

I love eating green crayons, and I'm as stubborn as they come.  

I and several cosigners/co-authors will be submitting a citizen's petition to the FDA. Below I share the general content I will be submitting. I believe there is enough data to approve Simufilam with post-marketing surveillance with my fellow Redditors.  

The actual submission to the FDA will not contain personal or unnecessary information that has been added for context and clarity for a non-scientific audience.    

**TLDR: It is my opinion based on my risk-benefit analysis: Simufilam (SAVA's Alzheimer's drug) must receive accelerated approval and move to phase 4 post-marketing surveillance.**  

1. **Severely unmet medical need. Every year 120,000 AD patients die with no effective treatment.**
2. **Simufilam (SAVA's AD drug) has been dosed 149,120 with no documented severe adverse effects. (Some adverse events may present as the number of doses are increased). Still, Simufilam has an excellent safety profile based on the current data.** 
3. **Publically available data showing improvement across 34 measures of AD.**    
4. **The FDA has acted on similar data in the past to fast-track medications to market.** 
5. **If the FDA rejects my petition, I believe Phase 3 and CMS trials will be used to advance Simufilam to market based on Simufilam's six-month interim analysis of the respective trials.**  
6. **I am not affiliated with SAVA as an employee, contractor, or any other way except that I am a long investor. I plan to hold my investment as long as the data remains consistent. I may consider hedging before the eventual binary outcome. This is not medical or financial advice. It is only the ramblings of a retarded deluded mega bull who has been wrong plenty of times in the past. Do your own due diligence.**  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3k5220kl7dx71.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97184a84f1f1b810fd2a473bcbe55c720bae1779

Artist William Utermohlen was diagnosed with AD (Alzheimer's disease) in 1995. In the figure above, he painted what he saw in the mirror. As we can see from his last painting in 2000, he spent the final seven years of his life incapable of seeing the world, effectively blind. He died in 2007.   

This view of AD from a patient perspective is tragic and touching. It elicits anxiety for those of us with sound minds. What's it like to look into the mirror, unable to see one's own face for seven years? What else are they unable to see?

I practice at one of the largest community hospitals in the southeast. As you know, for every 1000 medicare patient days in the hospital, 538 are associated with AD. AD is predictive of an extended and complex hospital stay with increased odds of death (compared to patients who do not have AD).  

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Overwhelming Public Need**

I have witnessed numerous families bring their elderly father or mother to the ER, saying, ""we cannot take care of him/her."" Not because they are forgetful, but because they are easily agitated and turn aggressive. These families do not ask, ""is there a treatment?"". They have already navigated a complex medical system and know AD is terminal with no effective treatment. Heart attacks, strokes, sepsis, and other diseases seen in hospitals have a myriad of treatments. AD does not. AD is the sixth leading cause, and by some estimates, it is the third leading cause of death. See ""[2021 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FACTS AND FIGURES](https://www.alz.org/media/documents/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf)""   

As a patient advocate, I elected to present anecdotal data to contextualize and humanize the numerous awful statistics we all know too well. 

I review these weighty problems with the FDA to help frame my logic and construct a petition for why Simufilam (PTI-125) must be expediently granted accelerated approval and advanced to phase 4 post-marketing surveillance.  

After reviewing the FDA's mission statement, I am operating on the premise that the FDA evaluates medications based on **risk benefits**. 

1) There is an overwhelming and urgent need (discussed above)

2) Simufilam's safety data is unblemished. (**The risk**)

3) The cognitive data, by my judgment, is a treatment effect, not placebo. (**The benefit**).

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Safety Data:** 

PTI- 125 has been administered to patients across 5 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03748706, NCT04079803, NCT04932655, NCT04388254, NCT04388254).  

More precisely, 39,620 doses of Simufilam were administered from the publicly available data, with no reported serious *adverse* events. Further, Patients tolerated Simufilam well, as is evident by the low attrition rate.  

In addition, there are 150 patients enrolled in the ""open-label extension trial"" (OLE). They do not have publicly available information; however, it is reasonable to assume the FDA is privy to safety data. The standard protocol requires study sites to report serious adverse events immediately to the FDA. Those OLE patients were administered another 109,500 doses.

Factoring in the OLE patients, in totality, **149,120** doses were administered without **serious** safety events across multiple trials. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3) The data:**

Data associated with Simufilam has been remarkably consistent.

A 28 day multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 64 patients measured:

1. Abeta42
2. Total Tau
3. P-tau181
4. Neurogranin
5. Neurofilament Light Chain
6. YKL-40
7. Paired Associates Learning Test
8. Spatial Working Memory Test
9. IL-6
10. sTREM2
11. HMGB1
12. Albumin
13. IgG
14. Filamin A Linkages to alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor
15. Toll-like Receptor 4 in Subject Lymphocytes
16. Plasma P-tau181
17. SavaDx 

Cassava Sciences stated: 

*""98% of patients treated with Sumifilam 50 mg or 100 mg b.i.d. for 28 days showed improvements in validated biomarkers of AD pathology; neuroinflammation; and neurodegeneration; with no safety issues.""*

Open-label Extension data tested:

1. P-tau
2. Total Tau
3. Abeta42
4. Neurofilament light chain
5. Neurogranin
6. YKL-40
7. Soluble TREM2
8. HMGB1
9. ADAS cog-11 (reported at 6, 9, and 12 months)
10. NPI (reported at 6, 9, and 12 months)
11. SavaDx

Tallied up, we have 34 different measures over twelve months and twenty-eight days. 

Now, let us focus on the data which is clinically the most relevant-ADAS cog, and NPI. 

A valid criticism of the twelve-month OLE data is that it is open-label, susceptible to placebo effect. However, a more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect highly probable and Placebo effect unlikely.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rygzv5xr7dx71.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28f32481a25284e78dfcb4f030c6ddaa575a1aae

A [meta-analysis](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jalz.2009.05.665) published by Ito et al. looked at placebo response data in 19,972 patients between 1990 and 2008. The disease progression in mild to moderate AD patients was estimated at 5.5 points per year. 

The disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a [follow-up analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23803296/), Ito et al. also highlight that the placebo response tends to be more significant in the first few months.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i6apf65x7dx71.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40a1d02e756b53d7951983b6018c32df4fa0ca58

A follow-up meta-analysis by [Zhang et al](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-00630-5). also looked at placebo response data in 19,210 patients between 1992 and 2019. The disease progression rate was estimated as 5.82 points per year, although this varied depending on region, age, and baseline ADAS-Cog scores. It's also suggested that placebo effect plateaus at approximately 16 weeks in clinical trials.

Simufilams ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g04exrj08dx71.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4af536185d1203d543339ecf42b019dd8c8500

The data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable.  Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. So, if a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-cog at twelve months or greater, this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature.  We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below.  

Taking a closer look at the delta between the above cohorts and the OLE ADAS-cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. By my estimation, this can not be explained by placebo.

Suppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes phase three a foregone conclusion, in my opinion.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mc50auy58dx71.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae23be0590116aaf3920043d8ffaee95127feb38

As mentioned above, behavioral disturbances are the explicit reason families abandon their loved ones in the ER. Caregiver stress is cited in ""Alzheimer's facts and figures"" as having numerous unfavorable outcomes. Worse, physicians are often forced to use antipsychotics for dementia-related psychosis and agitation, which increases the risk of death in the elderly. Restraints (a generous way of referring to tying patients to the bed) are an unfortunate last resort used in the hospital setting to prevent patients from harming themselves and staff. Simufilam use resulted in markedly fewer behavior disturbances, and this data continues to improve with time.

 

Fast-tracking a medication after a single-arm study would not be an unprecedented action by the FDA. As Ke Liu, MD, PhD cites [here.](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/presentation/presentation-us-fda-expedited-programs-expanded-access-ke-liu_en.pdf)

As is known, the cognitive data was collected over sixteen clinical sites across the US and Canada by independent Physician PI's and associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). The chain of custody was made transparent and verified by independent biostatisticians.

AD claims the lives of 13 patients every hour, and if the FDA allows phase three trials to continue for two years, then we risk the deaths of over 240,000 patients.  As functional status is an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality. I believe by preserving cognitive function, Simufilam will also preserve functional status (as the two are highly correlated). It may take years to see a mortality benefit, but waiting years in the setting of limited risk is unacceptable. 

I and my cosigners are humbly and optimistically submitting this Citizens Petition to review m my risk-benefit analysis.  I look forward to the FDA's correspondence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlse0j/44_sava_run_is_just_the_start/

A community that defines itself like this is not a confidence-inspiring place to get stock picks to YOLO your next paycheck into. I think, being the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins should make you seriously question the incentive of folks who are making the recommendations!  

Whether its for the insane YOLOs posted every day, or breaking Robinghood with infinite leverage plays, or the legendary short-squeeze involving GME, here is where the action goes down!

But what I am interested in is to see if **we can beat the** **market** **by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets!** After all,

![img](r0cedr2igbx71)

![img](1qtf5iajgbx71 "" "")

**Data**

Reddits PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec20.

The summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).

![img](gpp85mcjgbx71 "" "")

**Analysis**

Ahh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, its not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.

So what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \[2\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.

Considering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a. One Week

b. One Month

c. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)

The benchmark for comparison is SPY\[3\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.

![img](pu8irxajgbx71 "" "")

**Results**

Before we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**

![video](t2ii3hjlgbx71)

 *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/) 

![img](abx4tcqmgbx71 "" "")

We would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \[4\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[5\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - its definitely not for safe plays).

So, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?

![img](d4hwo3kngbx71 "" "")

Would you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.

But keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.

![img](9k19tq9ogbx71 "" "")

GME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \[6\].

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.

![img](h1zt22jpgbx71)

Unsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. 

![img](szf7uirqgbx71 "" "")

For every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.

But what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?

![img](b1qn01irgbx71)

Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \[7\].  

![img](n2mtnnbjgbx71 "" "")

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as its lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.
* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.
* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works  stay tuned!

![img](6kh47fcjgbx71 "" "")

**Conclusion**

Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with

&gt;The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!

I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***

Either its due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).

Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!

![img](zieahxcjgbx71 "" "")

**Footnotes**

\[1\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.

\[2\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.

\[3\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.

\[4\] Its lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.

\[5\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

\[6\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as its bound to happen. Even in the case of S&amp;P500, a vast majority of returns are [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).

\[7\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.

I know you have a lot of work to do but I believe you'll take your time once in a while and read on here when you got a bad day about TSLA and how great the company is and that its not just about cars, what an awesome guy you are and that you also got space x and other boring companies and so forth so probably you will stumble about this aswell.
When getting older n older from time to time one always questions whether that what you got is all about in life no matter if you are a trillionaire or just an ordinary guy getting by. I guess you got the same questions and at some point you will question yourself and do other meaningful stuff and leave the whole useful but meanwhile boring electric vehicle stuff to someone else and focus on new things or spend some more time with your child, something I can tell you you shouldn't miss in life.

I dont know when but as I believe in you and your wisdom that day will come and Tesla will be valued as an innovative fast growing company, not as the holly grail solving all worlds problems.

So I bought some puts and when they print I will donate to charity a big portion of the proceeds. As I am just an average guy and know you'll need your time they are deep ITM leaps so my proceeds wont change the world but you can make a difference now and sell and invest or build the next awesome company that does.

Best wishes to you

The British medical journal is linked to the British medical Association.

So this is not your average tin hat blogger throwing poo at ""the elites""

The article has been peer reviewed and the whistle blower has presented extensive documents and audio files to prove the accusations.
If the side effects they did not report during trials get officially acknowledged this could be the legal foundation for people affected by side effects to sue the company.

I am no lawyer but i can imagine their contracts which exclude liability for side effects are nil if they get convicted of committing fraud.

Biontech is a one trick pony and any harm to their vaccine business could be expected to reduce the companies valuation significantly.

I want to open with that my main goals are more focused on helping our dying ecosystem over making a large profit. But then I realized, what if these two ideas could be intertwined?
I know that in a lot of countries, oil runs the show time and time again, and they have been since the 19th century. 
However, now we are at a turning point. Fossil fuels in their current amounts are destroying the environment and most countries have invested too much into oil to try and back off of it now. The problem is that we need to push towards more renewable forms of energy. But governments aren't ready to do that. And even for the renewable forms that do exist, they lack the investor money to really start beginning these big processes.
So what if... WE invested in them? What if WE chose a couple of specific stocks in maybe aquaculture, wind, solar, etc...and WE became that changing tide that leads to the positive change we see in this world.

1,"11/03/2021, 13:32:26",Technical analysis in investing,Butterbread4962," I don't quite comprehend the intricacies of technical analysis, and I have never tried to use technical analysis to profit from a trade myself. Recently, however, it has come to my attention that even some of the most long-term and fundamentalist investors use technical analysis to aid their investments.

Do not be mistaken, I am **not** referring to trading stocks purely based on their technical indicators at a high frequency. Instead, I am alluding to using technical analysis to determine an appropriate buy-in-point for stocks that one has already screened using fundamental analysis. Put simply, the goal of this process is to buy into a stock at a relatively (short term) low price using technical analysis.

Although short term fluctuations in stock price should not be a factor in the due diligence of a long term investor, technical indications can still help such an investor buy into their favorite stock at a more favorable price point. For this reason, many active fund managers hire specialists in technical analysis to aid in their investment decision making.

""Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful"". Unfortunately, when others are fearful, the stocks tends to crash dramatically. It is common for value investors like me to be caught catching a falling knife as the stock continues to nose dive long after I have bought in.

With the power of technical analysis, however, one can potentially minimize odds of getting caught trying to catch the falling knife.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* The stock market's unrelenting climb propelled major US indexes to new all-time highs just a day before the Federal Reserve's policy announcement.
* Profit margins have held up exceptionally well, despite rising commodity prices and supply-chain snarls, underpinning that strength. Many businesses have been able to pass on higher prices to customers, with the majority of them outperforming earnings expectations. Regardless of what the Fed says or does on Wednesday, there is a belief that the US will continue to have low-interest rates, which is good for equities.
* Treasury two-year yields joined a global drop in short-term rates triggered by the Australian central bank's dovish speech released just a day before the Fed decision. With the Federal Reserve likely to begin winding down its asset-purchase program soon, analysts polled by Bloomberg are split on whether a rate hike would occur next year or in early 2023.
* Technical indicators are indicating further volatility following the recent equities rise. The S&amp;P 500 is not only testing the limits of its trading envelope, which is based on moving price averages, but the expansion of its upper and lower bands can also signal larger swings. Furthermore, the gauge's 14-day relative strength index is around 70, which some traders believe to be an overbought barrier.

&amp;#x200B;

# **THAT ENDS TODAY**

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Background\*\*

For those of you who don't know, Anavex is a company that is developing a drug to treat various CNS disorders. This drug, Anavex 2-73 (I'll refer to it as A273), has shown promising results in Rett Syndrome, Parkinson's Disease Dimentia, and most importantly, Alzheimer's Disease.

&amp;#x200B;

Alzheimer's is the Holy Grail of drug development. For years, big pharma companies including Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Biogen, and too many others to count have poured billions into researching a way to cure Alzheimer's with basically no success. But even with these decades of failure, Alzheimer's is such a tantalizing market that they just keep trying. Here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

There are about 6 million Alzheimer's patients in the US today. That number is projected to more than double over the next 30 years. Currently, there is no FDA approved therapy that can reverse/stabilize cognition among these patients. There isn't even one that can so much as \*\*slow\*\* their decline. Biogen's failed drug costs $56,000 per year. Very few patients are using it because the data shows that it doesn't really work, but if a company was able to get even a third of that US Alzheimer's population at about a third of that price point, the math would look something like this...

&amp;#x200B;

2,000,000 patients \* $18,000 per year = $36,000,000,000 revenue per year for A273

&amp;#x200B;

Pharma companies are usually valued at 4-5 times their sales, so that would imply a market cap between $144,000,000,000 and $180,000,000,000. Here's the kicker: Anavex's market cap is only at $1.6 billion as of today. Those market cap projections are optimistic, and I'm honestly targeting more like a $40-$50 billion market cap, but the numbers above are not out of the question with Alzheimer's alone.... Nonetheless what Anavex may do in Parkinson's, Rett Syndrome, Fragile X, and more.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Due Diligence\*\*

So why is Anavex so interesting? Here's a summary. An open label study of 32 patients showed that A273 improved cognition over 57 weeks and improved cognition even more when those same patients were tested at the 70 week mark. A separate dosage trial showed that A273's high doses largely stabilized cognition over 3 years while those who had less of the drug in their blood decline in line with what you'd expect from a placebo group (p-value &lt; 0.001). In a 132 patient, double blind, placebo controlled trial, A273 improved cognition by \~18% in the treatment group over 14 weeks while the placebo group declined by \~18%. It also vastly improved other symptoms of Parkinson's Disease in that same trial in a statistically significant manner. Additionally, in a placebo controlled trial of 25 patients with Rett Syndrome, A273 knocked it out of the park and acheived statistical significance across 3 difference measurement methods for Rett Sydrome. For example, two thirds of the treatment group were marked as responders on the RSBQ questionaire while only 10% (1 patient) in the placebo group were responders.

Last but not least, A273's has had no safety issues across its trials, and an interim analysis of their phase 2b/3 Alzheimer's trial with over 450 patients was cleared to continue after the safety data was analyzed by an independent body.

This consistent success across numerous indications coupled with the great safety data highly suggests that A273 is extremely active in improving or stabilizing cognition in individuals with CNS disorders like Alzheimer's while minimizing undesirable side effects.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Opportunity\*\*

Anavex is in a unique position. They have 2 phase 2/3 trials reporting data for Rett Syndrome (one before the end of 2021 and another in H1 2022) soon. Based on the previous trial, I expect these both to be a success. Additionally, they'll be releasing more open labal Parkinson's data over the next year. But most importantly, \*\*Anavex has a phase 2/3 Alzheimer's trial reading out in H2 2022\*\*. If this trial succeeds in line with the dosage trial described above and screenshotted below, this stock will go bonkers... The market cap would likely soar to anywhere between $40 billion and $100 billion nearly overnight. That's a share price between $566 and $1,416 just on Alzheimer's potential alone.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The YOLO\*\*

I am utilizing Jan 2023 $45 strike call options to capture the binary event of the H2 2022 Alzheimer's readout while minimizing my cost per share to help amplify the asymmetry of this opportunity. I have 39 options contracts (giving me the right to buy 3900 shares at $45 at any point before expiry), 692 shares in my Robinhood, and about 1,300 shares of exposure across my other various accounts (Roth IRA and other brokerages). I have posted screenshots from Robinhood below. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given the potential share prices cited above, this has an estimated potential payoff in the \*\*$3 million to $8 million\*\* range if everything works out as I described above. Obviously, it could be more or less depending on where things land, but this is a good range for the expected payout.

1,"11/03/2021, 13:06:01","JPMorgan, Cannabis and MOS Shill. Long TLRY",PenroseB," Hello friends.

I wanted to make a post highlighting a move made my JPM this afternoon to [restrict trading in US MSO's not operating on the Nasdaq, NYSE or TSX.](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-jpmorgan-restrict-trading-us-cannabis-stocks-letter-2021-11-02/)

**WHAT HAPPENED?**

*""Nov 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co* [*(JPM.N)*](https://www.reuters.com/companies/JPM.N) *has told prime brokerage clients it will no longer let them buy certain U.S. cannabis-related securities beginning Nov. 8, according to a letter seen by Reuters.*

***The move follows similar actions by other banks, including*** [***Credit Suisse***](https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-credit-suisse-stops-custodian-service-some-us-cannabis-stocks-sources-2021-05-05)***, after the high-profile*** [***collapse***](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-blocktrades-creditsuisse-idUSKBN2BM11L) ***of private fund Archegos Capital this year left several banks nursing*** [***losses***](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-q1-profit-up-14-switzerlands-no-1-bank-unveils-archegos-charge-2021-04-27/#:~:text=ZURICH%2C%20April%2027%20(Reuters),family%20office%20beyond%20%2410%20billion)***.***

*The saga drew regulatory scrutiny and prompted banks across Wall Street to review how much risk they are prepared to take on in their prime brokerage businesses.""*

To me, this is a clear signal that something very big is about to happen in this space.

**UP OR DOWN?**

Being that cannabis is about 70% off its highs from earlier this year, I struggle with how we can go much lower especially with every analyst PT well above our current levels.

Its currently November and we have a must pass NDAA that has cannabis banking reform worked in through the SAFE banking act.

Banking has long been viewed as the ultimate catalyst for this sector. There is a ton of money that wants to invest but is not allowed to enter due to federal regulations. JPM solidifies this statement with today's move.

There has been a lot of discussion as to whether or not SAFE banking would make it into the final NDAA. Schumer recently stated that he has no issues with safe banking, assuming he can get broad reform attached and social equity included.

Just last weekend, minority owned cannabis businesses pleaded with federal regulators to pass SAFE banking into the NDAA as social equity is already being worked into many state regulations, and not having access to a bank account is a much larger threat to their businesses.

I feel there is enough momentum on both sides to see this through in 2021. GOP states are scrambling to add legalization legislation. Schumer will read the room and either get broader reform (legalization) into the NDAA or he will allow SAFE banking to pass as its absolutely necessary.

**WHO DOES THIS HURT?**

Right now, any cannabis stock not operating on the Nasdaq, TSX or NYSE.

In short, multi-state operators (MSO's) are about to get fucked really hard.

They are going to lose access to shareholder capital and this will really slow their ability to scale against global competitors.

**WHO DOES THIS BENEFIT?**

Mother fucking Tilray.

MSO's in need of capital will now need to look towards companies like Tilray when they're in a pinch and need a bailout.

Flush with cash and a 4B/y revenue plan through acquisitions, I expect Tilray to take advantage of this opportunity in a big way.

Additionally, this should condense a very large investor pool down to the few companies that have been able to gain access to the NYSE and the Nasdaq creating a massive funnel to the likes of TLRY, CGC and (fuck me) ACB.

**HOW DOES** ***~~CITADEL~~*** **ARCHEGOS FACTOR IN?**

This is a preemptive move by JPM because they do not want to become the next credit suisse and get ass rammed by guys like *~~Ken Griffen~~* Bill Hwang and the fuckboys at *~~Citadel~~* Archegos.

**TILRAY, CITADEL and THE CORRELATION IN MEME STOCKS**

I have been trading TLRY since november of last year following the announcement of the APHA merger. I was long in APHA prior to the news drop and shifted into TLRY shortly thereafter.

Anyone who spends their days with their eyes glued to memes can tell you there is absolutely a correlation in them all.

I believe, as many of you do, that this correlation comes from Citadel.

Tilray is currently the only cannabis company they have any exposure too, both short and long.

Why is this? CGC is the preferred hedge cunt play so why is TLRY their only cannastock?

***Because of GME. Because of AMC. Because of us.***

Following the squeeze in GME many other short plays made massive moves. Tilray was one of them, going all the way from 6 to 65 in just 4 months.

We know that Citadel has a reputation of some seriously dank skulduggery so we can assume that it was them who has been running the short ladder from 65 all the way down to our current level of 10.50.

This wouldn't have been all to difficult considering the TLRY float is 85% owned by retail traders and they have the ability to short dark pools, sell shares they do not own and trade on multiple foreign exchanges (TSX and Frankfurt).

Using AI to trade in dark pools over multiple exchanges give them the ability to basket memes and control losses where they have over exposed themselves by selling shares that dont actually exist.

The Tilray float prior to its merger with APHA was tiny, this is why I dumped APHA for TLRY following the merge news.

Combining the two floats gave Citadel an opportunity to hide positions and control the narrative. Being that this stock is owned mostly by retail and most those retail cunts being us, they really couldn't help themselves.

**CONCLUSION**

The only Archegos in cannabis is Citadel. Unlike Bill and the boys, Ken is not over inflating stocks (yet) hes over shorting them. Absolutely nothing has changed. 9% of the float has been shorted traditionally (40M Shares) where 50% of the darkpool (19M Shares) is short.

Knowing that citadel is just as long as they are short and understanding that broad reform is right around the corner, it is my belief that JPM believes a massive move to the upside is getting ready to happen in ALL of cannabis and they want to minimize the risk should citadel or any other bad actor decide to run cannabis to insane valuations such as Archegos did with DISCA and VIAC.

IF Citadel loses their battle with MEME's this could be their only out, which is why its their only long in the space.

With most investors in Cannabis being retail, JPM surely cant be protecting themselves from us. When we lose they take our house, no big deal. When someone like Archegos or Citadel loses, everyone loses their house. Its a pretty big deal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlnawb/jpmorgan_cannabis_and_mos_shill_long_tlry/

First some background, I originally bought WKHS calls in mid June for Dec expirations. A friend of a friend mentioned that it was starting to run and I got in, it looked good for a little and has since withered to absolute shit. It was a bad all around trade on my part (Ive learned) but has nevertheless been in my portfolio staring at me for the past 5 months now. 

Long story short, they had a lawsuit against Oshkosh and USPS and they dropped the case which tanked the stock.

It recently bottomed out around $6 in mid October and has retreated to $8.12 as of todays AH. Its worth noting that its the 6th most shorted stock at 36.6% shorted float of $128,123,121. Approximately 46,892,585 shares as of Oct 15. Potential squeeze  .

The caveat in play is they have earnings on 11/8 pre-market and if they fail to deliver some positive guidance we may see $6 again or lower. Yahoo news has an article about how they may be an  EV value play and some good commentary on Robinhood under their ticker. If they deliver news about EV shit we may see it 

Anyway DYOR, good luck. Ill probably look to buy atm calls for a week after earnings tomorrow if there looks like a good entry point. Current position is 15 $40 strikes 12/17 from over the summer.

There are about 1 billion people in Europe, China, Australia and America that would not mind paying $500/month to drive Tesla. 

No one wants to drive electric car with better interiors but no brains which cant self drive. So competition is not really an issue. Tesla unlike other cars come with brains (software) and keeps getting smarter with every update

Assuming auto loans extend to 10 years and wage inflation continues to go up $500/month will be peanuts after couple of years.

Tesla needs to scale up production and bring down average cost of car to $500x12x10=$60000.

Assuming 1b people buy Tesla by 2024, its revenue should be
$60000x1b=$60000b=$60 trillion

At 30% margin on 1b cars, it should bring down market cap to $18 trillion.

If only 500m people bought it then it would be around $10T and $10000/share.

 I wanted to make a post highlighting a move made my JPM this afternoon to [restrict trading in US MSO's not operating on the Nasdaq, NYSE or TSX.](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-jpmorgan-restrict-trading-us-cannabis-stocks-letter-2021-11-02/)

**WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?**

Its currently November and we have a must pass NDAA that has cannabis banking reform worked in through the SAFE banking act.

Banking  has long been viewed as the ultimate catalyst for this sector. There is   a ton of money that wants to invest but is not allowed to enter due   to federal regulations. JPM solidifies this statement with today's move.

There  has been a lot of discussion as to whether or not SAFE banking would  make it into the  final NDAA. Schumer recently stated that he has no   issues with safe banking, assuming he can get broad reform attached and  social equity included.

Just  last   weekend, minority owned cannabis businesses pleaded with federal  regulators to pass SAFE banking into the NDAA as social equity is  already being  worked into many state regulations, and not having access  to a bank account is a much larger threat to their businesses.

I   feel there is enough momentum on both sides to see this through in  2021 and this recent move by JPM could strengthen that momentum. GOP  states are scrambling to add legalization legislation. Schumer will read  the room and either get broader reform (legalization) into  the NDAA or  he will allow SAFE banking to pass as its absolutely necessary.

**WHO DOES THIS HURT?**

Right now, any cannabis stock not operating on the Nasdaq, TSX or NYSE.

In short, multi-state operators (MSO's) are about to get boned really hard.

They   are going to lose access to shareholder capital and this will really  slow their ability to scale against global competitors.

**WHO DOES THIS BENEFIT?**

Tilray, CGC and ACB.

MSO's in need of capital will now need to look towards companies like Tilray when they're in a pinch and need a bailout.

Flush   with cash and a 4B/y revenue plan through acquisitions, I expect  Tilray to take advantage of this opportunity in a big way.

Additionally,   this should condense a very large investor pool down to the few  companies that have been able to gain access to the NYSE and the Nasdaq  creating a massive funnel to the likes of TLRY, CGC and (fuck me) ACB.

**HOW DOES** ***~~CITADEL~~*** **ARCHEGOS FACTOR IN?**

This is a preemptive move by JPM because they do not want to become the next credit suisse and get ass rammed by guys like *~~Ken Griffen~~* Bill Hwang and the twats at *~~Citadel~~* Archegos.

**WHY TILRAY?**

I  have been trading TLRY since november of last year following the  announcement of the APHA merger. I was long in APHA prior to the news  drop and shifted into TLRY shortly thereafter.

Anyone who spends their days with their eyes glued to memes can tell you there is absolutely a correlation in them all.

I believe, as many of you do, that this correlation comes from Citadel.

Tilray is currently the only cannabis company they have any exposure too, both short and long.

Why is this? CGC is the preferred hedge fund play, so why is TLRY their only cannastock?

***Because of GME. Because of AMC. Because of us.***

Following  the squeeze in GME many other short plays made massive moves. Tilray  was one of them, going all the way from 6 to 65 in just 4 months.

We know that Citadel has a reputation of some seriously dank skulduggery so we can assume that it was them who has been running the short ladder from 65 all the way down to our current level of 10.50.

This wouldn't have been all to difficult considering the TLRY float is 85% owned by retail traders and they have the ability to short dark pools,  sell shares they do not own and trade on multiple foreign exchanges (TSX and Frankfurt).

Using AI to trade  in dark pools over multiple exchanges could give them the ability to control losses on multiple tickers where they have over exposed themselves by selling shares that dont actually exist.

**TLDR;**

Knowing  that citadel is just as long as they are short and understanding that reform is right around the corner, it is my belief that JPM believes a massive move to the upside is getting ready to happen in ALL of cannabis and they want to minimize the risk should citadel or any other bad actor decide to run cannabis to insane valuations such as Archegos did with multiple media stocks earlier in the year.

With most investors in Cannabis being retail, JPMorgan surely cant be protecting themselves from us.

When we lose they take our house, no big deal.

When someone like Archegos or Citadel loses, everyone loses their house and its a pretty big deal.

I've been following health care/health insurance stocks and obviously recently most of them such as $UNH, $CNC, $ANTM have all beat earnings expectations and have popped up.  At this point it's pretty much given that this industry will do well in Q3 - so not sure which remaining stocks don't have this priced in.  (I do have some shares on for $CVS tomorrow so ).

WITH that said, the ones I mentioned are all huge providers of health insurance ($CVS is related but not exactly a provider).  They all have like 30B + market cap.  There are also smaller ones (less than $5B market cap) that are looking to gain market share that run negative EPS because of spend on trying to increase market share.  These include $BHG, the controversial $OSCR, and Chamath's $CLOV.

Personally, based on insider action, I think $BHG and $OSCR will do well and I am in both as well.  $OSCR has the most heavy insider buying.  Now insider buying may not mean the stock price will go up, but I tend to like buying at the same price insiders to - especially in an industry that will do well this earnings season.

$OSCR is $OSCR, so not much to talk about there other than I'm long it and might get some calls prior to earnings if cheap.  But $BHG, which I'm also in is the one I want to talk about.  

Today $BHG dropped 10% over nothing (other than a couple analysts downgrading the stock).  Now I've never followed the price action after analyst reports, but I do have a question for maybe some of the more knowledgeable out there.  

* Do stocks usually drop this much after analyst downgrades when there is no other news coming out on the company?
* **Do analysts usually produce ratings changes PRIOR to an earnings release and this close to a earnings release?**  Once again, I've never researched the timing of analyst ratings and the subsequent price action, but I do find it strange they would downgrade $BHG PRIOR to earnings and not AFTER earnings.

Because they issued the downgrade so close to earnings release, I'm a little sketched out.  Even insiders can't buy or sell right now.  Either they have access to non-material public information OR they are just lowering the price so they can buy some before earnings.

Anyone have any other examples of anecdotes of analyst rating changes?  My little knowledge says that they usually occur AFTER earnings when new information comes out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qllk29/anyone_follow_bhg_oscr_and_other_health_insurance/

1,"11/03/2021, 11:01:38","JPM, Cannabis and the Case for TLRY",PenroseB," Hello friends.

I wanted to make a post highlighting a move made my JPM this afternoon to [restrict trading in US MSO's not operating on the Nasdaq, NYSE or TSX.](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-jpmorgan-restrict-trading-us-cannabis-stocks-letter-2021-11-02/)

**WHAT HAPPENED?**

*""Nov 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co* [*(JPM.N)*](https://www.reuters.com/companies/JPM.N) *has  told prime brokerage clients it will no longer let them buy certain   U.S. cannabis-related securities beginning Nov. 8, according to a   letter seen by Reuters.*

***The move follows similar actions by other banks, including*** [***Credit Suisse***](https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-credit-suisse-stops-custodian-service-some-us-cannabis-stocks-sources-2021-05-05)***, after the high-profile*** [***collapse***](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-blocktrades-creditsuisse-idUSKBN2BM11L) ***of private fund Archegos Capital this year left several banks nursing*** [***losses***](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-q1-profit-up-14-switzerlands-no-1-bank-unveils-archegos-charge-2021-04-27/#:~:text=ZURICH%2C%20April%2027%20(Reuters),family%20office%20beyond%20%2410%20billion)***.***

*The   saga drew regulatory scrutiny and prompted banks across Wall Street to   review how much risk they are prepared to take on in their prime   brokerage businesses.""*

To me, this is a clear signal that something very big is about to happen in this space.

**UP OR DOWN?**

Being  that cannabis is about 70% off its highs from earlier this year, I  struggle with how we can go much lower especially with every analyst PT  well above our current levels.

Its currently November and we have a must pass NDAA that has cannabis banking reform worked in through the SAFE banking act.

Banking  has long been viewed as the ultimate catalyst for this sector. There is  a ton of money that wants to invest but is not allowed to enter due to  federal regulations. JPM solidifies this statement with today's move.

There  has been a lot of discussion as to whether or not SAFE banking would  make it into the final NDAA. Schumer recently stated that he has no  issues with safe banking, assuming he can get broad reform attached and  social equity included.

Just last  weekend, minority owned cannabis businesses pleaded with federal  regulators to pass SAFE banking into the NDAA as social equity is  already being worked into many state regulations, and not having access  to a bank account is a much larger threat to their businesses.

I  feel there is enough momentum on both sides to see this through in  2021. GOP states are scrambling to add legalization legislation. Schumer  will read the room and either get broader reform (legalization) into  the NDAA or he will allow SAFE banking to pass as its absolutely  necessary.

**WHO DOES THIS HURT?**

Right now, any cannabis stock not operating on the Nasdaq, TSX or NYSE.

In short, multi-state operators (MSO's) are about to get fucked really hard.

They  are going to lose access to shareholder capital and this will really  slow their ability to scale against global competitors.

**WHO DOES THIS BENEFIT?**

Mother fucking Tilray.

MSO's in need of capital will now need to look towards companies like Tilray  when they're in a pinch and need a bailout.

Flush  with cash and a 4B/y revenue plan through acquisitions, I expect Tilray  to take advantage of this opportunity in a big way.

Additionally,  this should condense a very large investor pool down to the few  companies that have been able to gain access to the NYSE and the Nasdaq  creating a massive funnel to the likes of TLRY, CGC and (fuck me) ACB.

**HOW DOES** ***~~CITADEL~~*** **ARCHEGOS FACTOR IN?**

This is a preemptive move by JPM because they do not want to become the next credit suisse and get ass rammed by guys like *~~Ken Griffen~~* Bill Hwang and the fuckboys at *~~Citadel~~* Archegos.

**TILRAY, CITADEL and THE CORRELATION IN MEME STOCKS**

I  have been trading TLRY since november of last year following the  announcement of the APHA merger. I was long in APHA prior to the news  drop and shifted into TLRY shortly thereafter.

Anyone who spends their days with their eyes glued to memes can tell you there is absolutely a correlation in them all.

I believe, as many of you do, that this correlation comes from Citadel.

Tilray is currently the only cannabis company they have any exposure too, both short and long.

Why is this? CGC is the preferred hedge cunt play so why is TLRY their only cannastock?

***Because of GME. Because of AMC. Because of us.***

Following  the squeeze in GME many other short plays made massive moves. Tilray  was one of them, going all the way from 6 to 65 in just 4 months.

We  know that Citadel has a reputation of some seriously dank skulduggery  so we can assume that it was them who has been running the short ladder  from 65 all the way down to our current level of 10.50.

This  wouldn't have been all to difficult considering the TLRY float is 85%  owned by retail traders and they have the ability to short dark pools,  sell shares they do not own and trade on multiple foreign exchanges (TSX  and Frankfurt).

Using AI to trade  in dark pools over multiple exchanges give them the ability to basket  memes and control losses where they have over exposed themselves by  selling shares that dont actually exist.

The Tilray float prior to its merger with APHA was tiny, this is why I dumped APHA for TLRY following the merge news.

Combining  the two floats gave Citadel an opportunity to hide positions and  control the narrative. Being that this stock is owned mostly by retail  and most those retail cunts being us, they really couldn't help  themselves.

**CONCLUSION**

The  only Archegos in cannabis is Citadel. Unlike Bill and the boys, Ken is  not over inflating stocks (yet) hes over shorting them. Absolutely  nothing has changed. 9% of the float has been shorted traditionally (40M  Shares) where 50% of the darkpool (19M Shares) is short.

Knowing  that citadel is just as long as they are short and understanding that  broad reform is right around the corner, it is my belief that JPM  believes a massive move to the upside is getting ready to happen in ALL  of cannabis and they want to minimize the risk should citadel or any  other bad actor decide to run cannabis to insane valuations such as  Archegos did with DISCA and VIAC.

IF Citadel loses their battle with MEME's this could be their only out, which is why its their only long in the space.

With  most investors in Cannabis being retail, JPM surely cant be protecting  themselves from us. When we lose they take our house, no big deal. When  someone like Archegos or Citadel loses, everyone loses their house. Its a  pretty big deal.

1,"11/03/2021, 09:47:54",Will Dillard's ($DDS) Buy Itself Entirely Back? Questions About The End Game For Serial Repurchasers,RoomTemplQ,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tommilpscax71.png?width=1333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb2d0e5d5e42f0dab6241dd48ed77b91e5f2d77

Hello Wallstreetbets,

Have any of you looked into 'the end game' for companies that are serial repurchasers of their own stock? I remember seeing [this news piece](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dillards-to-repurchase-up-to-%24500-mln-of-class-a-common-stock-2021-05-15) about Dillard's ($DDS) board approval for $500 million earlier and not thinking too much about it. I thought their YTD performance was primarily driven by a high short interest squeeze, similar to the moves in $GME and $AMC.

However, some really smart people in the industry have been paying attention, and prominent names like David Einhorn [mentioned owning Dillard's](https://youtu.be/D8R6fFq0siI?t=2266) during the turn of events this past year. While some algo-related short interest has helped propel the stock higher, it's incredible that a $5 billion enterprise value business has only 20 million shares outstanding. 

So, the question is, are other companies near this 'end game' like a snake that eats its own tail? Tickers like $KLAC, $IT, $BBWI, $CHTR, $CDNS, and $AZO are in high buyback ETFs, and have respectable-enough business models that the S&amp;P approves of.

Also, when I actually try to model out $DDS's current repurchase plan, I'm no Dexter, but I think it would take 170 years for the company to buy itself completely back (assuming constant $500 million in annual repurchases, same valuation as of today's closing price, 'flat' stock price per year, and eventually, fractional share repurchases). It would have to be modeled by day to actually see how the daily stock price fluctuates based on incremental repurchases, but the end game is the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gc1gs6kycax71.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5afa9067d64dcdc4089afd916a920b563ce52a10

According to those same calculations, this repurchase plan would give 13.9% ARR (annual rate of return) for the first 10 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hha00t90dax71.png?width=907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78d98df698fde0285810f5d5a48901f368585b3c

Do the flat-line assumptions make this too good to be true? Along with c-suite incentives to boost EPS and increase % control of the company, should boomer-esq companies just use FCF to repurchase instead of paying out dividends? 

**TLDR:** 

\- Dillard's ($DDS) has bought back a lot of stock. What are the end game implications for this?

\- What other companies are nearing this buyback 'end game'?

\- Is it possible to model repurchase plans multiple years out in advance?

&amp;#x200B;

Appreciate any responses in advance. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qljwq2/will_dillards_dds_buy_itself_entirely_back/

*Processing video sne0q4g8z9x71...*

Fair enough everyone knows what an NFT is, it allows you to declare that you are an owner of a digital asset and that you have the right to claim this asset as your possession and be allow to on sell it to the next owner like you would with any other asset that could not be replicated digitally as a perfect copy.

&amp;#x200B;

Given you have the asset attached to this post, what would be the point of owning the original of the bowl of dicks? Would you like to have bragging rights that the bowl of dicks is yours? Would you like to set the bowl of dicks on fire so it ceased to exist as an NFT? Would you like to commission the make to create a Bag of Dicks?

At the time of this post the bowl of dicks has no offers and is owned by me and is essentially worth nothing. But it makes me happy knowing that the bowl of dicks exists as an NFT. They are such cute and squiggy dicks, I am not even sure how many there are, but they fall, swizzle in the bowl and then reverse and fall up.

1,"11/03/2021, 08:19:47",SEC Filings and What You Need to Know,D00M007,"SEC Filings and what you really need to know

**SEC FILINGS**

Form 8-k

This form is used to report newsworthy events to the SEC, thereby making them available to the public. Included are items such as change in management, change In the companys name, mergers or acquisitions, bankruptcy filings, and major new product introductions or sale of a product line. A Form 8-K HAS to be filed when a member of the board of directors resign over a disagreement. The 8-K is filed within four business days of the occurrence. This form is used only by domestic issuers, foreign issuers are exempt. Although ADRs are registered with the SEC, they too are exempt because of the underlying security of foreign issue.

Form 10-K

Most domestic public issuers must file an annual report to the SEC on FORM 10-K. This report is a comprehensive overview of the companys business and financial condition and includes financial statements that have been audited by an independent accountant. Do not confute this with the annual report to shareholders, which also contains and audited financial information than the annual report, while the annual report will have much more detail about the company itself and its future plans.

The Filing Deadlines depend upon the companys public float. For Companies with a float of $700million or more, the Form 10-K deadline is 60-days after the close of the fiscal year; $75 million, but not $700 million, it is 75 days; and less than $75 million is due at 90 days.

Form 10-Q

Because one year between filings is a long time and a lot can happen quickly, we also have this form, and it is filed quarterly (Q for quarterly). It contains unaudited financial statements and for all but the companies with a public float of less than $75 million, it must be filed within 40 days of each of the first three fiscal quarters of the year (no 10-Q is filed at the end of the fourth quarterthat information is taken care of by the filing of the 10-K). Those smaller firms file theirs within 45 days of the end of the quarter.

Annual Reports

When it comes to publicly traded companies, in general, all shareholders must receive a copy of the issuers annual report. For those too lazy to access EDGAR, this is the most detailed information they can get on the companys financial position. Unlike the Form 10-K, this is usually a professionally prepared piece with just as much used for marketing purposes as it is for providing information. There is usually a welcoming letter from the CEO/Chairman of the board, and it is generally loaded with beautiful pictures of smiling people (employees and customers) and the companys facilities. New plans for products and programs are discussed and voting proxies are included.

Form S-1

SEC Form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the SEC for public companies that are based in the U.S. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Companies usually file SEC Form S-1 in anticipation of their initial public offering (IPO). Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition and provide a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities.

SEC Form S-1 is also known as the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. Additionally, the SEC requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue.

Foreign issuers of securities in the U.S. dont use SEC Form S-1 but instead must submit an SEC Form F-1.

Form S-3

SEC Form S-3 is a regulatory filing that provides simplified reporting for issuers of registered securities.

An S-3 filing is utilized when a company wishes to raise capital, usually as a secondary offering after an initial public offering has already occurred.

In order to utilize the simplified process, firms must first meet a certain set of eligibility criteria.The SEC form S-3 is sometimes filed after an initial public offering (IPO) and is generally filed concurrently with common stock or preferred stock offerings.

There are a variety of other requirements that must be met for a business to file the S-3 form. In the 12 months prior to filling out the form, a company must have met all debt and dividend requirements. The SEC Act of 1933 also requires that these forms be filed to ensure that essential facts about the business are disclosed upon the companys registration of securities. Doing so allows the SEC to provide investors with specifics about the securities being offered and works to eliminate fraudulent sales of such securities.

Form 4

SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders consist of directors and officers of the company, as well as any shareholders, owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock. The forms ask about the reporting person's relationship to the company and about purchases and sales of such equity shares.Form 4 must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders .If a party fails to disclose required information on a Form 4, civil or criminal actions could result. It must be filed within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred.

Schedule 13D

The Schedule 13D is also known as the ""beneficial ownership report"" and is required when any owner acquires 5% or more of the voting shares in a company. The report must be filed within 10 days of reaching the 5% threshold. It provides the following information: The acquirer's name, address and other background information, Type of relationship this owner has with the company, Whether the person has been convicted of a crime in the past five years. An explanation of why the transaction is taking place, The type and class of the security, and The origin of funds used for purchases.

Form 144

Form 144 is required when corporate insiders want to dispose of company stock. The Form 144 is a notice of the intent to sell restricted stock, typically acquired by insiders or affiliates in a transaction not involving a public offering. The stock is restricted because it must meet certain conditions before becoming transferable. The transaction, or at least part of it, is made within 90 days of filing. Form 144 is required when the amount sold during any three-month period exceeds 5,000 shares or $50,000.

Initial Public Offering (IPO)

A corporations first sale of common stock to the public.

Secondary Offering

A Sale of Securities in which one or more major stockholders in a company sell all or a large portion of their holdings; the underwriting proceeds ae paid to the stockholders rather than to the corporation. Typically, such an offering occurs when the founder of a business (and perhaps some of the original financial backers) determine that there is more to be gained by going public than by staying private. The offering does not increase the number of shares of stock outstanding.

Regulation D (Private placements continued.)

The provision of the Securities Act of 1933 that exempts from registration offerings sold in private placements. Rule 506(b) limits the Sale to a maximum of 35 NON-accredited investors during a 12-month period with no advertising permitted, while Rule 506(c) permits advertising but requires that all purchasers be accredited investors.  
 

Accredited Investor - As defined by Rule 501 of Regulation D, any institution or individual meeting minimum net worth requirements for the purchase of securities qualifying under the regulation d registration exemption. An individual accredited investor is generally accepted to be one who, individually or with spouse, has a net wort, excluding the net equity in the primary residence, of $1 million or more, or has had an annual income of $200,000 or more in each of the two most recent years (or $300,000 jointly with a spouse), and who has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year.

SEC Rule Change Effective 12/08/2020 -- Individuals who hold the Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82 Licenses, are now considered accredited investors by qualification.

Idk what a price target for this would be but market cap is small AF. I think were gonna get halted a lot tomorrow so hopefully that doesnt cause a crash like what happened with DWAC. Def a halt on open because there is simply and wont be enough shares to cover 60% of float, I doubt they could clean up all these shares in one or two days even.

Technically speaking if no one sells or minimal ppl sell cuz paper hands the 400mil purchase alone would make it move more and more since it is massive buying pressure. I got in about 28.5 and it is shares so worst case I lose 50%, who cares lol. Good scenario I make like 300-500% as it runs over few days. Someone also mentioned they had like 3 days to cover so Ill probably be exiting on Friday the latest.

1,"11/03/2021, 08:05:35",$YPF Largest oil company in Argentina,Competitive-Still294," Surely the majority of you never listen about YPF, but is the biggest oil company in Argentina

Usually, I never post about argentinian stocks (which I think have a lot of potential), but risk/reward ratio for $YPF at this point is very worth. 

Today, Pablo Gonzalez (YPF CEO's) told on an interview for a local newspapper that ***next ER will show the third consecutive Quarter with more than USD 1B on EBITDA***

https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202111/573524-recuperacion-productiva-ypf-inversion.html

FYI, YPF market cap is just  USD1,64B... So, at this point ***YPF is trading below x1 EBITDA/MARKET CAP***

***YPF is also trading at the RIDICULOUS P/BV ratio of 0,2***... Only his tower in one of the most valuable neighborhoods of Buenos Aires (Puerto Madero) is worth 25% of his market cap

But for me the real catalyst for YPF is that once elections finish (14th November), Government will authorize an increase on gas prices (which are very low as a populist measure). They are holding it to retain as votes as possible.

Argentina is already dealing with IMF for a debt restructuring. I'm very confident that they will reach an agreement, but I don't know if it will happen in the short term

In summary:

&amp;#x200B;

* CEO broke quiet period and slide some insides about next ER (will present 10 November)
* Government will increase oil and gas prices soon
* Ridiculously cheap from a fundamental/financial side.
* IMF negotiations

Btw, from a technical point of view, is looking very good too

&amp;#x200B;

If Oil doesnt crash, YPF can easily go to 7,25. With a SL at 4, you are risking 4% for a potential gain of 74%

I'm also adding a comparison vs Brent

2. With such a small float (22 million) and no covering its very likely shorts are trapped here in this given scenario if they buy the price will hike rapidly.
3. This scenario has played out before last time they announced a special dividend,  going from 19$ to a new ATH of 34$ in less than month.

Every store delivery order from Walmart has been fucked up.  Not a single one was correct.  And theyve reached a level of delivering steaming shit.

I will never shop at Walmart again, and sure as shit never use DoorDash for anything.

What is my point?  It doesnt work; from the bottom up, in and out, through and through, Walmart has failed at its store delivery service.  It is simply a failure.  They fucked up.

Closing Walmart position.  Not buying DoorDash because the driver either shat and wiped with my toilet paper, or delivered shitty toilet paper that a Walmart employee wiped with and put in the bag that DoorDash picked up.

Selling S&amp;P futures because our society has reached a place where I am delivered toilet paper that wiped a shitty ass.

Selling NQ futures because whats we the fuck tech Walmart is using cannot result in a single correct order being fulfilled, which means tech is garbage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlfpyl/walmart_and_doordash_just_delivered_used_toilet/

At age 19, he became the youngest graduate of Harvard Law School. As if he wasn't impressive enough, he's also proficient in ballroom dance and horse-back riding. We're going to ride this stallion to the moon.
Now, as founder and CEO of CS DISCO (ticker: LAW) , he's changing the field of law. DISCO is helping law firms and regulatory agencies navigate complexity and improve efficiency by leveraging cloud technology and artificial intelligence. Their technology helps attorneys and regulators find information faster and build successful cases using historical data.
CS DISCO deploys a subscription-based pricing model with additional usage-based pricing to carry out a land-and-expand strategy. A customer can begin using DISCO software at a relatively low price, but as usage increases so does their pricing. Law firms can share access to their platform when partnering with other firms, truly a genius referral-based marketing strategy that is extremely capital efficient.
This is a large total addressable market that is ripe for disruption. I believe no competitors have better technology. Law is one of the last industries to go paperless and CS DISCO will take it there.

I do not have a position because I do not know all the ins and outs on insider trading rules. So I am posting it here to make it not insider information. This is all thirdhand information from somebody that doesn't have a full view of the company. He probably doesn't know what he's talking about. That would mean I definitely don't know what I am talking about. You shouldn't trade on any of the following information. That would be silly.

The CEO and People &amp; Culture (HR) bigwigs are going around middle management and pushing hard on vaccine status attestation. They will almost certainly be going hard on vaccines themselves soon. Things have come to a head and the bigwigs have put those unwilling to attest to vaccination status on leave-without-pay. It probably only affected a handful of the most artistic programmers.

They have done this without consulting the project managers. The affected project managers are going to have a hard time getting their projects done with some of their most artistic employees pulled from the team suddenly. My understanding is there was no planning for this. Upper management seems to assume programmers are a commodity. I suspect they are not. I am assuming antivaxxers skew artistic in the programming world. Just based on past experience, good programmers are not in-the-box-thinkers, they tend to think they are smarter than everybody else about everything, and are the most likely not to respond well to ""do this because I said so"" stuff. Viasat hasn't gotten to the get-vaxxed-or-get-out point. But it seems like that is likely going to be coming soon. And when it does, they will be sidelining many more of their most artistic programmers.

I know many think the company is going to eat it when Starlink comes out. I don't know about that. What Starlink is trying to do is hard. But I am saying that a handful of been-vaxxed-so-much-they-already-got-artism-so-bad-they-don't-even-want-to-say-if-they-drank-the-Fauci-juice-or-not programmers are locked out. I suspect Viasat is planning on locking out or repurposing other slightly-less-artistic-but-still-pretty-artistic programmers for not being vaxxed. And Viasat thinks this won't be such a big deal because they plan on rearranging the workforce because C-suite managers think that's no big deal with programming projects. I think that means Viasat is prolly going to eat some shit you weren't expecting. Because what Viasat does is hard and programmers are not commodities. And Viasat is pulling off something like a 1941 Red Army Purge right before the Starlink competition kicks off and the Viasat-3 launch.

They probably aren't going to zero or anything. But the bigwigs are playing chicken with artists who think they know more than Fauci and the bigwigs are fixing to find out.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has told prime brokerage clients it will no longer let them buy U.S. cannabis-related securities beginning Nov. 8, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

The move follows similar actions by other prime brokerages, like Credit Suisse, aimed at reducing risk of regulatory action after the fallout from the high-profile collapses of Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital earlier in the year.

Cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, even though many states have legalized its medical or recreational use. This represents a legal risk for investment banks working for companies that produce or trade the drug.

**Pros:**

1. Stock price &lt; $5
2. Short interest = 30%
3. Days to cover = (30% \* 88M) / Avg Vol (10 day) 3 = 4.23M) = 26M/ 5 **&gt; 5 days**
4. Analyst price target ranging from 5 to 7 after last quarterly results.
5. near term catalyst of tie up with Carvana.

**Cons:**

1. management competence is suspect to say the least
2. dumped by most fund managers and darling of short sellers.
3. highly competitive insurance market

1,"11/03/2021, 03:58:47",why it's OK to take short term capital gains,codemonkey14,"So I hear a lot of folks parrot the wisdom of ""hold your positions for at least a year to maximize gains by paying less taxes"" and I wanted to dispel some of the bullshit. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR **diamond handing meme stocks for lower taxes isn't worth the risk to profits on volatile underlyings**

&amp;#x200B;

Lets take a simple example:

Curious George has $1000 in his account

Curious George yolo's his $1000 in to $WSB shares

$WSB skyrockets 20% on news that Tesla is partnering with the Federal Reserve to build battery powered money printers.

Assume Curious George is in the 24% tax bracket for income and short term gains, and 15% bracket for long term capital gains.   


Curious George's account balance is now $1200.

if Curious George takes his profits less than a year after originally buying $WSB, he owes 24% \* $200 = $48 to the IRS. Fuck the IRS.

if Curious George diamond hands the shares for over a year and shares remain exactly at the same price, Curious George will owe 15% \* 200 = $30. 

on the surface, this looks like a clear winner. But $WSB is a volatile stock and if Curious George's account decreases by just 1.5% from it's current $1200 value, Curious George will have lost more money than he would pay in additional short term capital gains tax compared to long term capital gains tax.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlcqwi/why_its_ok_to_take_short_term_capital_gains/
1,"11/03/2021, 03:56:14",$ISR - New Hot List Pick - Peter Leeds,Eyes2theSkies," Peter Leeds - ***New Hot List Pick (ISR)***  
   
**Isoray, Inc.**  
ISR, AMEX  
Biotechnology  
Date of Original Report: November 2, 2021  
Price as of Report Publication: 0.61  
Buy Opinion: 0.57  0.66  
Short Term Sell Opinion: 1.00  2.00  
Long Term Sell Opinion: 2.00  3.00  
Stop Loss Price Opinion: 0.51  0.56  
 

We normally steer clear of biotech stocks. While you may see them appearing in our weekly Swing Trades, theyre typically too volatile and unproven to be included among our Hot List Picks.  
 

Todays Pick, Isoray, Inc. (ISR), is an exception. Its technologies, which are based on targeted radioactive isotope rays that fight cancer, are undeniably powerful and effective. In contrast to many of its biotech penny stock peers, ISR actually reports a revenue every quarter.  
 

(To wit, ISR had a not-bad average of 16% sales growth over the past five years, and announced almost 20% revenue growth in the most recent earnings versus the previous year period.)  
 

COVID-19 put a dent in ISRs performance over the past couple of years, but the recent bump in sales indicates the market is recovering. Even still, we caution readers that ISR may not be a stock that ever climbs out of penny story territory, or in other words transcends the $5+ point.  
 

As youll see in our price estimates above, we think its more likely the stock will climb to $1.50 - $2.50 before petering out, barring some unexpected and very big news at the company. A CEO change? A huge discovery? Both are plausible  especially the former.  
 

But even without a shocking announcement of that nature, we believe ISR has upwards of 100% upside. Youll ignore this one at your own risk.  
 

In addition to its advanced and proven technologies (which the group is busy expanding outside its original terrain of prostate cancer), Isoray is extremelywell, loaded. Its quick and current ratios are 36.80 and 37.40, respectively, and the P/C ratio is at an excellent 1.38.  


EPS this year, furthermore, showed 36% growth, and was up 57% in the most recent quarter. Gross Margin is a very healthy 50.90%.  
 

COVID hampered the companys attempts to provide physicians with workshops on their isotope ray technologies, but these have helped the group increase sales in the past. As the world returns to normal, it stands to reason that the workshops will resume and sales will expand once more.  
 

Were interested to see whether ISR can start exporting its technologies outside the US, as it said it was in the process it was doing before the pandemic hampered its plans. Wed also like to see whether its technologies can catch on more strongly in the brain and lung cancer areas, with CEO Lori Woods suggesting a lot of interest and potential there.  
 

A great acquisition or partnership  which ISR is definitely able to do, given its huge treasure chest  could also push up the needle on the stock and capture the markets interest.  
 

We believe ISR is certainly undervalued at the current moment. Even without a significant piece of news ahead of it, the stock price will likely increase as more investors grow aware of the hidden potential of its technologies and seek recession-proof stocks.  
 

And if the company announces something really exciting, then we just might see shares going to $3+, for at least 400% upside potential here. Not bad for a stock thats trading well below a dollar.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlcow5/isr_new_hot_list_pick_peter_leeds/

1,"11/03/2021, 03:19:12",$BNTX could be an amazing play in the next 2-3 weeks.,Nofapdeity,"If you remember, I posted about $BNTX about a month ago. I am still in it. You may want to read this. 

**Bullish points**

1: PFE just had an excellent earnings report, meaning BNTX most likely will as well. This could send the stock flying up. 

2: if MRNA has good earnings, this could send the stock flying as well since these 2 seem to stick together in the market. 

3: On 11/12, BioNTech will be revealing the results of BNT211. Read about it [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biontech-present-clinical-data-first-120000223.html). If this is positive news and they find a cure to cancer or are very close to it, I cant imagine how that would affect the SP. This is high risk investing, especially since this is after earnings. 

4: PFE and BNTX just recently got FDA approved to give their vaccine to kids. The CDC is currently discussing it, and will vote on it **today**. This is the only vaccine approved for kids as of now. 

**Bearish points**

1: BNTX follows MRNA like a puppy. If MRNA has bad earnings on Thursday, this could make BNTX price look like a waterfall. 

2: if they announce that their cancer study was a failure, it could bring down the share price. 

3. NVAX is trying to get their vaccine approved, and from what I understand they do not need to store it in cold temperatures like BNTX vaccine needs to be. 


My eyes are on their earnings and their cancer treatment study. If BNTX succeeds in curing cancer, Im sure you understand how that could affect the share price.

American Lithium already has a deal with TLSA. There might be an unnounced deal with Cruz. On their website, Cruz uses Tesla EVs as design elements. Maybe someone in their IT did an oopsie.

And in terms of logistics, they are the same. I find TSLA with a deal in the future will be pretty certain.

1,"11/03/2021, 03:04:31",Strong Buy ,Timothysg88,"According to IPO news, on the evening of November 2, 2021, 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (Nasdaq: $YQ) disclosed that with the approval and authorization of the board of directors, the company will start a share repurchase program to repurchase common shares (including American depositary shares) with a total value of no more than 10 million US dollars in the next 12 months.

Subject to market conditions and applicable rules and regulations, the Company will make buybacks to the open market from time to time at prevailing market prices, or negotiated transactions, block transactions and other means permitted by law. The company's board of directors will regularly review the share repurchase plan, and the source of funds for repurchase is the company's own funds.

In addition, the announcement also disclosed that 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. plans to adjust the ADS ratio from 2 ADS for every 5 Class A common shares to 1 ADS for every 10 Class A common shares. The company expects this adjustment to take effect around November 17, 2021.

Since the implementation of the ""double reduction"" policy, the domestic education industry is undergoing profound changes, and a large number of companies are actively seeking business transformation. 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. chose to buy back shares at this time, which undoubtedly conveyed a good expectation of its own business prospects to the market.

It is understood that 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. 's predecessor was homework together. The biggest difference between 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. and other educational institutions is that homework together has served the teachers and students of public schools since its establishment ten years ago. Its core business is its intelligent operation platform ""Work Together"" APP and its derived educational digital transformation solution. As a new education infrastructure, it promotes the efficient application of educational data and the improvement of intelligent teaching facilities, promotes the implementation of ""double reduction"" with intelligent technology, and builds a good education ecology.

According to Frost &amp; Sullivan's report shows that by the end of 2020, the ""Work Together"" APP has entered more than 70,000 public primary and secondary schools in China, accounting for about one-third of the country, with 900,000, 54.3 million and 45.2 million users of teachers, students and parents respectively, with a broad user base.

Based on Internet plus education, serving the digital transformation and upgrading of China's basic education has been deeply rooted in the genes of 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc.. Under the background of complying with and implementing the ""double reduction"", 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. has also explored a new development path faster based on its own accumulation and scientific and technological innovation.

According to the public information of Shanghai Government Procurement Network, 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. successfully won the bid for the ""Accurate Teaching and Adaptive Learning System Project Based on Intelligent Homework"" of Minhang District Institute of Education, and the total budget of this project reached tens of millions of yuan.

Relying on the intelligent operation platform, Students' daily homework, node homework for academic testing, Even the process data in long-term operations can be collected, Based on the label system and intelligent analysis system of homework big data, the platform can obtain data analysis results of different dimensions for district-level, school-level and class education and teaching participants, and rely on data to cooperate with targeted resource recommendation, hierarchical homework and hierarchical teaching, making it possible to teach students in accordance with their aptitude under the background of large class teaching.

It is reported that the ""1258 Project"" in Minhang District, to which the system belongs, has also been selected as one of the top ten cases of implementing the ""double reduction"" announced by the Ministry of Education not long ago.

This is just one of a series of major breakthroughs in 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. 's recent transformation.

By introducing 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. 's comprehensive evaluation system of teaching and examination, Xicheng District has created a new pattern of multi-level data-driven areas and improving school teaching quality through data collection and analysis, from front-line teaching scenes to educational analysis.

According to public information, besides Minhang, Xicheng and 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. are also carrying out in-depth cooperation with the education systems in Nankai and Chengdu.

It is worth noting that, In July 2021, the Ministry of Education, the Network Information Office, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank jointly issued the ""Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Construction of New Education Infrastructure and Building a High-quality Education Support System"", clearly proposing ""development based on big data. Applications such as intelligent diagnosis, resource push and learning counseling promote students' personalized development.""

17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. 's strategy of empowering regional and public schools with ""Internet plus Education"" can not only promote the burden reduction and efficiency improvement of schools, but also help the implementation of the ""double reduction"" policy. It is also one of the current policy orientation and exploration directions of new education infrastructure. It is conceivable that the ten-year service to public schools has become a powerful driving force for 17 Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. 's new round of development.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlbk7o/strong_buy/

1,"11/03/2021, 02:59:18",Former RKT bag holder FUD,Omnipotent-Ape,"
Former $RKT bagholder here: 862 shares @ $24.

(I've got links for every point but the bots think I'm promoting Motley Fool lololol).

TLDR: Dan Gilbert will keep getting paid, diluting shares, and leave retail holding the RKT bags of shit.

I've been bagholding Rocket Mortgage since January 2021.  Yes, I'm a dumbshit for not selling in March when RKT squeezed to $41.  Since then, I've averaged down several times, but I'm done with this shit stock.  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE - I FREAKIN' OWN RKT!!!

-The CEO Jay Farner was the 17th highest paid CEO in 2020 making $52 million.  Most stocks have rocketed this year, but RKT has been a complete dud.  Screw this guy, he's overpaid.

-A huge problem (my fault for not doing enough DD) is the 2 billion implied shares of RKT owned mainly by the founder Dan Gilbert.  There's 138 million shares in the market today.  This is why no institutional investors are buying and why there was a short attack on RKT pre-WBS short squeeze.  A mountain of dilution waiting to trickle out.

--RKT promised $1 billion in buybacks in November 2020.  What the hell is the price point that the buybacks kick in?   RKT used a measley $8 million dollars of the $1 billion available (Q2 earnings call)....but don't forget about that ridiculous implied float.  $1 billion won't do shit for the price.  Also, the buy back can be used for class A shares or Gilbert's mountain of class D shares (a D share equals 10 A shares).  In other words, Gilbert is getting paid first.

-Mortgage rates have risen, and are expected to continue rising, cutting into home refinances, home equity loans, and originations.  RKT's p/e is low, but it's expected to be 7x in 2021 and 10x in 2022.  Mortgage applications have been dropping since June too.  Rising rates is increasingly likely.  We all see the inflation chatter and the market is increasingly betting rates are rising sooner than expected.  Rising rates hurts all of RKT's businesses; especially refi and originations.

-RKT has no dividend, has too many shares outstanding, is hated by everyone, and is just an awful stock overall.  Good news?  RKT drops.  J-Pow printing?  RKT drops.  Buy the dip?  RKT only drops.

-RKT was one of the few real short-squeezes following GME.  It went to the moon for one week, but has been a bag of shit ever since.  Short interest remains around 8%, but there's no ammo left for a RKT squeeze.

-The Rocket Community Fund (their philanthropic arm) is donating $150 million  (with another $350 coming from Dan Gilbert's philanthropic organization) over the next 10 years to pay off the property taxes of people in Detroit.  Nothing wrong with charity, but maybe a company should take care of their shareholders too.  Gilbert will continue to dilute shares to fund this.

-RKT is expanding into rocketauto.com (basically a lame Google for cars - they don't own the cars, just have cars listed on a website for sale) and solar.  Yes, fucking solar.  If the great Elon Musk can't make money off solar, RKT mortgage has no chance.  There's some money in financing cars and so on, but nothing revolutionary.

-Last February, RKT announced a partnership to originate loans with Morgan Stanley.  On 8/23 Morgan Stanley dumped 78% of their RKT shares. Holy fuck!

-RKT has some fucked up incentives: the IPO had a built in tax liability payable to Dan Gilbert and could be up to  $11 billion dollars.  Literally, the owners interests aren't aligned with shareholders.  Info is old, but I missed it.  Credit to JP Investments on YouTube.  This dude was bullish af on RKT before this video.

-The icing on the cake was Motley Fool recommending RKT as a long-term value play in September.  Fuck me.

RKT has earnings coming up on 11/4.  Maybe they announce another special dividend, maybe they announce more buybacks, maybe they crush earnings and profitability, maybe they're the only ones on the planet who figure out how to make solar highly profitable, maybe this goes down as the worst DD in WSB history.  By the time you read this, I'll have sold RKT for a ~25% loss.  Fuck you Rocket Mortgage.  

Seriously though, I hope all the RKT bag holders get their due.  If it wasn't for other moves I've been lucky with I'd still be bag holding myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlbfmm/former_rkt_bag_holder_fud/

It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... 

I've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... 

If Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now  . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . 

Look I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. 

The question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? 

Another note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill .

The company has completed its merger recently and after falling sharply post mergers has almost fully recovered.

The company has executed well on its financial projections and will likely match the targets it had shared in its investor presentation.

I've seen this model play out in multiple geographies and what makes it particularly lucrative in the long run is the addition of fintech products (car insurance, car financing).

In terms of valuation is seems to be in line with peers like Carvana ($CVNA) and Vroom ($VRM) while playing in the untapped European market.

Finally, Altimeter's commitment as a Pipe investor played a huge role in my decision to jump around 7$ as they are one of the leading growth stage tech investors with a long term vision.

But having gotten in on CAR at $ 75, I felt like maybe I shouldn't be greedy and heeded [this chump Carter Worth's advice](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/10/27/revving-up-for-a-breakdown-the-chartmaster-says-get-out-of-avis.html) to bail on the stock last week. I sold at $163 and planned to buy back my 10 shares after earnings. 

This morning, I had a flat tire and went to the tire shop to get it replaced. I'm standing in line and I see the stock is up to $181 pre-market. I don't like trying to buy stocks on my phone, but I brought my laptop with me. I figured I'd check the car in, then walk over to a McDonald's down the street to get some coffee, where I'd buy back my 10 shares. The McDonald's was no more than a ten minute walk, but by the time I ordered my coffee, sat down, connected to their wifi and fired up Active Trader Pro, it said the stock was trading at $362!

I thought it was a mistake but checked another website and realized it wasn't a mistake. I didn't know whether to cry or scream or throw my coffee. I sat there just watching the damn thing go UP, UP, UP to like $482 or something like that, at which point I turned my computer off, horrified. Thank you for listening to my tale of woe. Yes, I know, I made some money but dear Lord I could have made much more. I hate you Chart Master, I really do. 

P.S. As I said at the outset, I do know better than this. I watch CNBC for information and not for all the bogus opinions they spout.

1,"11/03/2021, 02:27:45",SAVA Short Squeeze Might Be Occuring Now,OnceGotABlowjobAMA,"As of writing this post, Cassava Sciences (SAVA) is up more than 36% today on no news.

&amp;#x200B;

SAVA has been a battleground stock for shorts over the past few months. The short interest used to be in the low double digits, but a group of short sellers put out a petition questioning Cassava's science in late August and many other shorts piled on bringing the short interest up to 25% now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been watching SAVA all year. A majority of this shorting action has occurred since late August when that short attack happened. With the price now at $62, many of these new shorts that came in at the end for easy money now find themselves underwater. 

&amp;#x200B;

My only explanation for this move today is either that someone has inside information on a partnership (SAVA's CEO teased a major partnership a couple months back) or it's a short squeeze. I believe it to be the latter. Even if this started with someone buying on inside info, the short squeeze has now begun.

&amp;#x200B;

This thing could certainly go way higher as these shorts start to feel the pain. If the pressure stays on, we could easily see this cross the $100 mark and force them all to liquidate, especially if a lot of people join in on the trade.

&amp;#x200B;

What do ya'll think?

There is really a big chance that we will beat estimates this coming earnings report on Nov 10. as the company raising their guidance a month and a half before earnings due is already posturing strength and confidence. You see, ML is only currently trading at 8x 2021REV while other fintech space are at around 20-50x. We have analysts covering ML and has a price target of $12, that is a 100% increase from these prices. We are seriously a growing company with these metrics below:

1. Sign up with 5 new debit cards or credit cards. (or more)
   1. \*can optionally sign up with a relative's information or local homeless
2. After signing up with 5 new debit cards, deposit $5 to one of them and straight into Robinhood through bank transfer. Make sure options are enabled.
   1. \*until homeless method gets patched, id recommend reusing the info here as well
3. After you've done this, deposit 999 on each one 5-6 times each until your/their/each/the bank gets blocked.
4. You should get roughly 50-60k with this method, this will usually only land you 2-5 years in prison (30-40 if you used the homless guy's information)
5. buy $TSLA Puts 0 DTE and sell in 20 minutes over and over again until you have infinite money.
6. profit

However, acquisitions like this don't necessarily end up being profitable in the long term, with the child company either being absorbed or sold again. The plan is to have one person run both Logistics companies, but have them be independent of AEO. That to me, is a sign of potential gain.

TORONTO, CANADA  November2, 2021  Cybin Inc.

Founded in October 2019, Cybin is a company that has evolved in many ways on its journey to create ethical and equitable scientific platforms.

Cybins leadership, including CEO Doug Drysdale and the Companys senior scientific research team, are hosting the R&amp;D briefing.

This data and the molecular possibilities may have wide-reaching implications for the treatment of mental health.

We are on a mission to create safe and effective therapeutics for patients to address a multitude of mental health issues. At a time when COVID has exacerbated the mental health crisis to epidemic proportions, the Cybin team has been exceptionally productive. We are excited to share the deeply meaningful scientific progress that we have made. You will not want to miss this, said Drysdale.

A california Judge has dismissed a lawsuit against $TEVA by Los Angeles, Santa Clara and Orange counties and the city of Oakland.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/j-j-teva-defeat-50-billion-opioid-case-in-california](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/j-j-teva-defeat-50-billion-opioid-case-in-california)

This  is a major win for $TEVA, now that litigants can see that suing over the opioid crisis is not a slam dunk they may be more likely to settle at reasonable terms, for all parties involved, rather than risk long costly drawn out legal battles which may ultimately fail

Hopefully you listened to me on the RKLB S-1 effective play as it went down around 20% over the 3 days following the PIPE unlock. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2thtj/rklb\_warning\_s1\_effectivepipe\_unlock\_should/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2thtj/rklb_warning_s1_effectivepipe_unlock_should/)

SPAC PIPE unlock short trades have been extremely profitable. Popular WSB tickers like IRNT, SPIR, etc. all absolutely nuked on an event called S-1 effective, which happens sometime after a company files it's S-1. When the S-1 is effective, the PIPE investors are able to sell their shares. Because they got a good deal, normally around $8, they often do to lock in a huge profit. That's why all those tickers got absolutely crushed on their PIPE unlocks.

BKKT is currently in the middle of a squeeze. It has not yet filed it's S-1, but that is likely to happen this week, if not by end of day today. After that happens, it'll probably be 7-10 days before the PIPE unlocks.

So I'm a bit early here. But I'm not the only person looking for good PIPE unlock trades. There will be a lot of smart people shorting this thing into the PIPE unlock. So my guess is the time to short is now, while this turd is super overextended. Once the S-1 is filed, we should see a flurry of put buying and this thing will reverse quickly. IF this manages to stay high, it may go down 50-60% upon S-1 effective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql83b8/bkkt_short_of_the_century_going_into_s1_effective/

[**$MTTR  Matterport**](https://utradea.com/stocks/MTTR) **Stock Analysis:**

On October 28th 2021, Facebook announced that they are changing the company name of their parent company (formerly Facebook) to Meta, and that their stock will be changing from FB to MVRS. This move was in large part due to the privacy backlash Facebook has been getting, which will help them get somewhat of a fresh start. Additionally, this change also signals Facebooks commitment to building a Metaverse which will be in large part built with VR and AR technologies.

This announcement sent ripples in the investment space, especially among retail investors. Since this announcement we have seen smaller cap Metaverse cryptocurrencies skyrocket well over 100%. However, this was just the initial reaction, and this hysteria is starting to make its way into the stock market, propelling Metaverse stocks to decent gains. This is especially true for smaller cap Metaverse stocks like Matterport, which has increased by over 30% since the announcement on October 28th.

**Matterport Company Information:**

Matterport is a spatial data company that digitalizes and indexes various types of buildings. Matterport has their own 3D data platform that is able to turn any real-life indoor space(s) into an accurate digital replica. This identical virtual space can be used to build operate, promote, and understand the space (this will be discussed later).

Matterport has over 150 commercial clients that range from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Additionally, Matterport has scanned/replicated 10B square feet of indoor spaces over 150+ countries.

**Investment information:**

*Success Stories:*

Matterport has listed some cases in which their services provided large benefits for their commercial clients in the following categories. As you will see, Matterport has been vary useful for their clients, helping them to increase revenues, save time, and save money. Furthermore, these cases show how versatile Matterports service is, and how wide their potential use cases span.

*Design:* 

Matterport helped Corgan to reduce their time of capturing by over 50%, helping them to gain efficiency and validation. Furthermore, by using Matterport it is estimated that their costs were reduced by a factor of 20x. This was a large project for Matterport, scanning over 18,000 square feet, helping them to prove they are the best option for cost/efficiency for large area scanning.

*Build:*

Matterport helped HH Angus to gain efficiencies in their Building Information Modelling processes. This helped HH Angus to experience large savings in both time (50% reduction in time capturing spaces), and money (50% reduction in cost for surveys). This was another large project for Matterport, scanning 17,500 square feet of space, which helps to prove that Matterport is consistent in their time savings for larger projects.

*Promote:*

Amy Kite has been using Matterport to scan the homes that she is listing on the real estate market in Chicago. By using Matterport Amy was able to create a unique, informative, and interactive environments that engage online clients. Success for Amy came quickly as her time-on-page for her online listings increased by 100%, which helped her to reduce the time her listings stayed on the market by 50%. Furthermore, it reduced the time for photography/scanning by 90%, which helped Amy incur additional savings.

*Repair:*

Chicago Water &amp; Fire Restoration wanted to streamline documentation for claims. They realized that their traditional methods would not work, so they partnered with Matterport, which has proven to be a great decision. Matterport helped them to increase their accountability, customer service, and quality assurance. This translated into a 5-7% increase in revenues, a 10% workflow capacity increase, and a decreased number of claims (potentially false claims).

*Metaverse Speculation:*

There has been a lot of hype around Matterport ever since Facebook switched their name to Meta and has released their plans for the Metaverse. Currently, this is all just speculation, and all of this has had a large impact on the $MTTR stock (up 30% in the past 4 trading days).

However, Matterport is a leader in the 3D scanning and spatial data industry, so it would make sense if Matterport has some role to play in the creation of a Metaverse. Furthermore, on June 30th, 2021, Matterport and Facebook collaborated on realistic virtual environments for AI. This is good news for the speculators, as there is already some history between the companies, and they are familiar with each others services.

If Matterport becomes the most influential/responsible company for helping to create the Metaverse, their business and their stock should do extremely well. This is especially the case if/when the Metaverse is widely accepted as Matterport will be able to scan in real life buildings which can have many use cases. 

Matterport would be a great company for Facebook to collaborate with on the Metaverse, as Matterport already has 10B square feet of indoor spaces scanned. Additionally, Matterport is very efficient in their scanning and will be able to add to this quicker than many other special data companies, making Matterport even more of an obvious choice.

One potential use for Matterport in the Metaverse would be scanning tourist sites. For an example, Matterport could scan the Louvre Museum and create a way that people can virtually tour the Louvre in the Metaverse. This deal would most likely bring in recurring revenues for Matterport, as the Louvre will be able to charge for tickets, and Matterport will be able to essentially charge virtual rent for Louvre to keep their virtual museum up and have constant updates so people can see new exhibits.

*Matterport 3D Camera App:*

As previously stated, Matterport has over 10B square feet of indoor space mapped. This number has increased very quickly over the past 6 months as Matterport rolled out their App on the IOS App Store, and more recently on the Android App Store. These releases have been vital in building Matterports valuable spatial database. Furthermore, the release of the Matterport app on Android (on October 28th, 2021 (same day as Facebooks name change to Meta)) should help Matterport to further expand their database of spatial data. 

Matterport is able to greatly expand their spatial databases shortly after their app launch as they offer a first scan free promotion. This allows customers (both individual and enterprise) to test out their mobile version free of charge to get familiar with their app and perhaps choose to continue with a paid version. This launch allows Matterport to acquire customers at a low cost, while expanding their spatial database very quickly. Promotions like these will enable Matterport to build some of the biggest spatial databases in the world which will be insanely valuable if the Metaverse is widely integrated.

This app is also very useful for Matterports commercial clients who need to scan multiple different places/facilities across different regions/countries. This is due to the fact that they do not have to order multiple Matterport cameras and ship them to the spaces that thy need scanned. Rather, they can choose 1 employee/manager to make the scan on a given day. This can reduce the time to scan lets say 100 buildings from 100+ days to less than a day. 

Currently, Matterport works well with phone scans, however Matterports in-house cameras provide superior quality and are more useful for enterprises who need a high degree of accuracy. However, the developments in camera technology in mobile phones over the past decade have been immense, and as this development continues, Matterports mobile scanning technology will only work better.

**Investment Valuation:**

In order to value $MTTR I could only undergo a DCF model. This is because $MTTR does not currently yield any dividends, and they have limited financial information and ratios. Furthermore, I used information from Matterports Investor presentation in order to project their revenues. Since these figures come from Matterport, they may be a little biased. 

As you can see in my DCF model, the fair value for $MTTR is $30/share, which implies an upside of over 20%.

**Earnings:**

Matterport is releasing their Q3 2021 earnings on November 3rd, 2021. This has the potential to be a huge catalyst for Matterport stock, as it is their first earnings report since going public on July 23rd, 2021.

**PIPE Lock-Up Expiration:**

In their SEC filings, Matterport notes the fact that their PIPE investors can sell as early as 180 after the completion of the merger. This means that the lock-up will expire on January 19th, 2022, and investors should expect a large sell off on this date (10-20% is likely).",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql7v6i/mttr_has_many_use_cases_including_spatial_data/

This helped HH Angus to experience large savings in both time (50% reduction in time capturing spaces), and money (50% reduction in cost for surveys). This was another large project for Matterport, scanning 17,500 square feet of space, which helps to prove that Matterport is consistent in their time savings for larger projects.

*Promote:*

Amy Kite has been using Matterport to scan the homes that she is listing on the real estate market in Chicago. By using Matterport Amy was able to create a unique, informative, and interactive environments that engage online clients. Success for Amy came quickly as her time-on-page for her online listings increased by 100%, which helped her to reduce the time her listings stayed on the market by 50%. Furthermore, it reduced the time for photography/scanning by 90%, which helped Amy incur additional savings.

*Repair:*

Chicago Water &amp; Fire Restoration wanted to streamline documentation for claims. They realized that their traditional methods would not work, so they partnered with Matterport, which has proven to be a great decision. Matterport helped them to increase their accountability, customer service, and quality assurance. This translated into a 5-7% increase in revenues, a 10% workflow capacity increase, and a decreased number of claims (potentially false claims).

*Metaverse Speculation:*

There has been a lot of hype around Matterport ever since Facebook switched their name to Meta and has released their plans for the Metaverse. Currently, this is all just speculation, and all of this has had a large impact on the $MTTR stock (up 30% in the past 4 trading days).

However, Matterport is a leader in the 3D scanning and spatial data industry, so it would make sense if Matterport has some role to play in the creation of a Metaverse. Furthermore, on June 30th, 2021, Matterport and Facebook collaborated on realistic virtual environments for AI. This is good news for the speculators, as there is already some history between the companies, and they are familiar with each others services.

If Matterport becomes the most influential/responsible company for helping to create the Metaverse, their business and their stock should do extremely well. This is especially the case if/when the Metaverse is widely accepted as Matterport will be able to scan in real life buildings which can have many use cases. 

Matterport would be a great company for Facebook to collaborate with on the Metaverse, as Matterport already has 10B square feet of indoor spaces scanned. Additionally, Matterport is very efficient in their scanning and will be able to add to this quicker than many other special data companies, making Matterport even more of an obvious choice.

One potential use for Matterport in the Metaverse would be scanning tourist sites. For an example, Matterport could scan the Louvre Museum and create a way that people can virtually tour the Louvre in the Metaverse. This deal would most likely bring in recurring revenues for Matterport, as the Louvre will be able to charge for tickets, and Matterport will be able to essentially charge virtual rent for Louvre to keep their virtual museum up and have constant updates so people can see new exhibits.

*Matterport 3D Camera App:*

As previously stated, Matterport has over 10B square feet of indoor space mapped. This number has increased very quickly over the past 6 months as Matterport rolled out their App on the IOS App Store, and more recently on the Android App Store. These releases have been vital in building Matterports valuable spatial database. Furthermore, the release of the Matterport app on Android (on October 28th, 2021 (same day as Facebooks name change to Meta)) should help Matterport to further expand their database of spatial data. 

Matterport is able to greatly expand their spatial databases shortly after their app launch as they offer a first scan free promotion. This allows customers (both individual and enterprise) to test out their mobile version free of charge to get familiar with their app and perhaps choose to continue with a paid version. This launch allows Matterport to acquire customers at a low cost, while expanding their spatial database very quickly. Promotions like these will enable Matterport to build some of the biggest spatial databases in the world which will be insanely valuable if the Metaverse is widely integrated.

This app is also very useful for Matterports commercial clients who need to scan multiple different places/facilities across different regions/countries. This is due to the fact that they do not have to order multiple Matterport cameras and ship them to the spaces that thy need scanned. Rather, they can choose 1 employee/manager to make the scan on a given day. This can reduce the time to scan lets say 100 buildings from 100+ days to less than a day. 

Currently, Matterport works well with phone scans, however Matterports in-house cameras provide superior quality and are more useful for enterprises who need a high degree of accuracy. However, the developments in camera technology in mobile phones over the past decade have been immense, and as this development continues, Matterports mobile scanning technology will only work better.

**Investment Valuation:**

In order to value $MTTR I could only undergo a DCF model. This is because $MTTR does not currently yield any dividends, and they have limited financial information and ratios. Furthermore, I used information from Matterports Investor presentation in order to project their revenues. Since these figures come from Matterport, they may be a little biased. 

As you can see in my DCF model, the fair value for $MTTR is $30/share, which implies an upside of over 20%.

**Earnings:**

Matterport is releasing their Q3 2021 earnings on November 3rd, 2021. This has the potential to be a huge catalyst for Matterport stock, as it is their first earnings report since going public on July 23rd, 2021.

**PIPE Lock-Up Expiration:**

In their SEC filings, Matterport notes the fact that their PIPE investors can sell as early as 180 after the completion of the merger. This means that the lock-up will expire on January 19th, 2022, and investors should expect a large sell off on this date (10-20% is likely).",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql7s3l/mttr_has_many_use_cases_including_spatial_data/

On October 28th 2021, Facebook announced that they are changing the company name of their parent company (formerly Facebook) to Meta, and that their stock will be changing from FB to MVRS.

On October 28th 2021, Facebook announced that they are changing the company name of their parent company (formerly Facebook) to Meta, and that their stock will be changing from FB to MVRS. This move was in large part due to the privacy backlash Facebook has been getting, which will help them get somewhat of a fresh start. Additionally, this change also signals Facebooks commitment to building a Metaverse which will be in large part built with VR and AR technologies.

This announcement sent ripples in the investment space, especially among retail investors. Since this announcement we have seen smaller cap Metaverse cryptocurrencies skyrocket well over 100%. However, this was just the initial reaction, and this hysteria is starting to make its way into the stock market, propelling Metaverse stocks to decent gains. This is especially true for smaller cap Metaverse stocks like Matterport, which has increased by over 30% since the announcement on October 28th.

**Matterport Company Information:**

Matterport is a spatial data company that digitalizes and indexes various types of buildings. Matterport has their own 3D data platform that is able to turn any real-life indoor space(s) into an accurate digital replica. This identical virtual space can be used to build operate, promote, and understand the space (this will be discussed later).

Matterport has over 150 commercial clients that range from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Additionally, Matterport has scanned/replicated 10B square feet of indoor spaces over 150+ countries.

**Investment information:**

*Success Stories:*

Matterport has listed some cases in which their services provided large benefits for their commercial clients in the following categories. As you will see, Matterport has been vary useful for their clients, helping them to increase revenues, save time, and save money. Furthermore, these cases show how versatile Matterports service is, and how wide their potential use cases span.

*Design:* 

Matterport helped Corgan to reduce their time of capturing by over 50%, helping them to gain efficiency and validation. Furthermore, by using Matterport it is estimated that their costs were reduced by a factor of 20x. This was a large project for Matterport, scanning over 18,000 square feet, helping them to prove they are the best option for cost/efficiency for large area scanning.

*Build:*

Matterport helped HH Angus to gain efficiencies in their Building Information Modelling processes. This helped HH Angus to experience large savings in both time (50% reduction in time capturing spaces), and money (50% reduction in cost for surveys). This was another large project for Matterport, scanning 17,500 square feet of space, which helps to prove that Matterport is consistent in their time savings for larger projects.

*Promote:*

Amy Kite has been using Matterport to scan the homes that she is listing on the real estate market in Chicago. By using Matterport Amy was able to create a unique, informative, and interactive environments that engage online clients. Success for Amy came quickly as her time-on-page for her online listings increased by 100%, which helped her to reduce the time her listings stayed on the market by 50%. Furthermore, it reduced the time for photography/scanning by 90%, which helped Amy incur additional savings.

*Repair:*

Chicago Water &amp; Fire Restoration wanted to streamline documentation for claims. They realized that their traditional methods would not work, so they partnered with Matterport, which has proven to be a great decision. Matterport helped them to increase their accountability, customer service, and quality assurance. This translated into a 5-7% increase in revenues, a 10% workflow capacity increase, and a decreased number of claims (potentially false claims).

*Metaverse Speculation:*

There has been a lot of hype around Matterport ever since Facebook switched their name to Meta and has released their plans for the Metaverse. Currently, this is all just speculation, and all of this has had a large impact on the $MTTR stock (up 30% in the past 4 trading days).

However, Matterport is a leader in the 3D scanning and spatial data industry, so it would make sense if Matterport has some role to play in the creation of a Metaverse. Furthermore, on June 30th, 2021, Matterport and Facebook collaborated on realistic virtual environments for AI. This is good news for the speculators, as there is already some history between the companies, and they are familiar with each others services.

If Matterport becomes the most influential/responsible company for helping to create the Metaverse, their business and their stock should do extremely well. This is especially the case if/when the Metaverse is widely accepted as Matterport will be able to scan in real life buildings which can have many use cases. 

Matterport would be a great company for Facebook to collaborate with on the Metaverse, as Matterport already has 10B square feet of indoor spaces scanned. Additionally, Matterport is very efficient in their scanning and will be able to add to this quicker than many other special data companies, making Matterport even more of an obvious choice.

One potential use for Matterport in the Metaverse would be scanning tourist sites. For an example, Matterport could scan the Louvre Museum and create a way that people can virtually tour the Louvre in the Metaverse. This deal would most likely bring in recurring revenues for Matterport, as the Louvre will be able to charge for tickets, and Matterport will be able to essentially charge virtual rent for Louvre to keep their virtual museum up and have constant updates so people can see new exhibits.

*Matterport 3D Camera App:*

As previously stated, Matterport has over 10B square feet of indoor space mapped. This number has increased very quickly over the past 6 months as Matterport rolled out their App on the IOS App Store, and more recently on the Android App Store. These releases have been vital in building Matterports valuable spatial database. Furthermore, the release of the Matterport app on Android (on October 28th, 2021 (same day as Facebooks name change to Meta)) should help Matterport to further expand their database of spatial data. 

Matterport is able to greatly expand their spatial databases shortly after their app launch as they offer a first scan free promotion. This allows customers (both individual and enterprise) to test out their mobile version free of charge to get familiar with their app and perhaps choose to continue with a paid version. This launch allows Matterport to acquire customers at a low cost, while expanding their spatial database very quickly. Promotions like these will enable Matterport to build some of the biggest spatial databases in the world which will be insanely valuable if the Metaverse is widely integrated.

This app is also very useful for Matterports commercial clients who need to scan multiple different places/facilities across different regions/countries. This is due to the fact that they do not have to order multiple Matterport cameras and ship them to the spaces that thy need scanned. Rather, they can choose 1 employee/manager to make the scan on a given day. This can reduce the time to scan lets say 100 buildings from 100+ days to less than a day. 

Currently, Matterport works well with phone scans, however Matterports in-house cameras provide superior quality and are more useful for enterprises who need a high degree of accuracy. However, the developments in camera technology in mobile phones over the past decade have been immense, and as this development continues, Matterports mobile scanning technology will only work better.

**Investment Valuation:**

In order to value $MTTR I could only undergo a DCF model. This is because $MTTR does not currently yield any dividends, and they have limited financial information and ratios. Furthermore, I used information from Matterports Investor presentation in order to project their revenues. Since these figures come from Matterport, they may be a little biased. 

As you can see in my DCF model, the fair value for $MTTR is $30/share, which implies an upside of over 20%.

**Earnings:**

Matterport is releasing their Q3 2021 earnings on November 3rd, 2021. This has the potential to be a huge catalyst for Matterport stock, as it is their first earnings report since going public on July 23rd, 2021.

**PIPE Lock-Up Expiration:**

In their SEC filings, Matterport notes the fact that their PIPE investors can sell as early as 180 after the completion of the merger. This means that the lock-up will expire on January 19th, 2022, and investors should expect a large sell off on this date (10-20% is likely).",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql7miw/mttr_has_many_use_cases_including_spatial_data/
1,"11/03/2021, 00:09:46",IVC,MilkIntelligent5649,"Anyone want to give their two cents on Invacare(IVC)? It went down 10 percent in the aftermarket after news got released that  IVC would be exiting the s&amp;p 600. The thing is, if all funds that tracked the s&amp;p 600 sold off IVC, it wouldnt change the value of IVC by over a percent. Whats funny is that the value of IVC dropped five minutes before the news of the removal got released. On top of that, IVC is heavily owned by institutions. The stock has also had major dips in the past for no significant reason(where it lost up to 50% of its value within an extremely short time frame. It seems clear that it is being heavily manipulated by institutions to get the public to sell at a very low price so that they can buy back at a discount. The true value of the companys stock sits at around $5.60, but its at $4.40 as of yesterday. Also, the market cap of IVC is currently at $150 million, which was $50 million below the next least valuable stock in the s&amp;p 600. This removal from the s&amp;p 600 seems a bit too delayed if you ask me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql7m59/ivc/

This trade is currently my largest options position, and I'm hoping it will be the best trade I have ever made. 

Now that I'm done hyping it up, the move is BITO call options. 

I am heavily interested/invested in c.rypto, and have been following B.itcoin for a few years now. Currently, cryp.to is going through a bull run fueled mainly by B.itcoin. 

BITO is a proshares ETF of Bitc.oin futures.  It literally came into existence less than 2 weeks ago, and was the 2nd most traded ETF in history.

It is an ETF based on Bitc.oin futures and not direct B.itcoin, so you can look up the futures formula, but in general it follows the underlying asset price. 

This means that BITO is essentially a way to buy options for Bitc.oin. 

I am extremely bullish on Bit.coin, targeting $100k.this month, and up to $200k by January. This would cause BITO prices of $50-60+. My absolute max target for BITO is ~$200 ($300k B.TC). 

Most of my calls are for 12/17 and 12/31. I have a few for 12/3 as well, and one for 3/18/22. All of my calls are in the $45-60 range, so that I could buy as many contracts as possible. 

I'm not here to debate with anyone, I simply wanted to share a trade that I believe will be hugely successful as I have received a lot of great DD from members of this sub. 

As always, I'm a retard and this is not financial advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql7ged/bito_ready_for_takeoff_pack_your_bags/

1,"11/30/2021, 23:35:46",A Medical Doctor's take on CLOV,Dr_Ape_MD,"When I invested in CLOV I did it for two reasons, but the most important one was that they provide the only currently feasible solution to a problem that costs billions of dollars per year: deficits in actionable patient care information.

Medicare Advantage is designed to reward good health outcomes while having a judicious use of resources. This means, in short, keeping your patients as healthy as possible, out of the hospital, not using unnecessarily expensive treatment options, and not overusing diagnostic procedures. 

To achieve this, the Primary Care Physician (PCP) must be on top of hundreds (sometimes thousands) of patients under their care. Also, for a typical Medicare practice, this also means coordinating care with several specialists per patient and keeping tabs on treatments as well as diagnostic procedures ordered. 

This was really complicated in the era of paper medical records, and everybody took a breath of relief when the use of electronic medical records became mandatory. We thought we would be able to seamlessly exchange information with our colleagues and run meaningful reports that would allow us to identify points of improvement and optimize care. 

Wrong!! The reality is that unless you are employed by a hospital, every physician is responsible to procure their own electronic medical records system (EMR), and there are dozens in the market. The worst part is that most EMRs dont talk to each other, which means that the exchange of information between colleagues is still via fax, so unless that information is entered manually in the PCPs EMR it will not appear on a report and can be easily overlooked. 

LOTS of information that could be used to lower costs and improve care is lost because of this problem. 

Who can fix this? The EMR companies would have to invest significant amounts of money to harmonize their systems and would have no financial reward, no thank you. Insurance companies have no intention or way to help, they want the results but are unable to provide the tools to do the job. Physicians are physicians, what do you expect, and have no alternative but to put more work hours and maintain a ridiculous amount of personnel to get the job done. Catch 22. 

Consequence? LOTS!! of information that could be used to optimize patient care is not captured, seen, acted upon, or lost in the system; and billions of dollars are wasted in one of the most expensive healthcare systems in the world. 

Clovers approach is to create an organization that can bring the technology needed to fix this issue, IMPLEMENT it, and rip the rewards.  

Clover Assistant can interact with most EMRs and add that layer of communication so sorely needed. Moreover, it can use this aggregated data to contextually help physicians make better decisions, lower costs, and avoid information compartmentalization. This translates into better outcomes with fewer expenses and less work for the physician who will ultimately become the best advocate for the insurance/technology company. 

What does this translate to? For Clover, it means that they must build an insurance company and take it to profitability in a fierce market full of behemoths of questionable moral standards while making the added investment in technology development and implementation. This requires exceptional human and financial resources as well as a lot of cojones. 

For us as investors, it means a bumpy ride, full of uncertainty and fear, but with a very promising future owning a piece of the company with a truly disruptive technology that cant be easily replicated. Every bump on our way is also part of the moat that will separate us from the competitors. 

I will leave you with a few final remarks that give me the confidence in Clover:
a)	Clover has been able to carry out the task even with the historic setback imposed by COVID-19.
b)	At the time COVID-19 hit the hardest, Clovers membership was mostly located in one of the most affected states, New Jersey. We didnt know how to manage it and the expenses per patient were astronomical.  
c)	The more Clover Assistant is used, the more valuable it will become.
d)	The cost of software development goes down significantly over time.

If you answered yes to either question I have a great opportunity for you to either make massive returns or catastrophic losses. Recently, I have been developing a new method for stock valuation (I know everything is priced in) and I wanted to document my driest trial run. Therefore I decided no better place to try it than the only subreddit where you can provide finically crippling information to a large amount of inbreds! 

The run down on the model: While I know that my model is no perfect model nor is it something that is the best in the world. But I believer has about a 83.69420% chance of being accurate. The model is started but utilizing Costcos most recent public financials and other valid finical information. I take this and layout a 7 year prediction of all their future financials and document the present value. I then add into the model some of the publicly available information about the company and the macroeconomic factors that I believe will affect Costco in the near future and document the present value. This along with a third *redacted* valuation method I can come to a decently terrible prediction for the value of Costco.

The Findings: I believe that the value of Costco will fall by March of 2022 to approximately $330-360 per share. This is approximately where the stock was trading 7-8 months ago. However, it has ballooned up to $556 today. This is primarily based upon growth opportunities for Costco and the growth of their market (along with more redacted information). Moral of the story is its worth looking into shorting or buying long pits for Costco.

This makes it very likely that Centerfold will actually launch before then. I believe the launch will be a news-worthy event and will draw a lot of eyes to the stock. 

For my original DD on why Centerfold matters, see the previous DD: [ =  -- $PLBY hitting an inflection point, and will challenge OnlyFans and Instagram in early December.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/)

# What's the opportunity?

**Up until now, Centerfold has just been a little known concept and something in the pipeline -- not even remotely on the radar of most investors. On launch, it will become a reality, an official news event, and investors will decide just how much real potential it holds for PLBY stock. In my opinion, the ability to invest in an OnlyFans competitor capable of pulling in 9+ digits of recurring revenue on short order is appealing.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qiiyactapq281.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62c64313900241d70a640abf0b16a2b0052f2e2a

On Friday at 9:00pm, this message was sent to holders of Rabbitars, PLBY's &lt;forbidden-token-phrase&gt; project that pulled in millions in Q3. These &lt;forbidden-token-phrase&gt; are meant to be ""membership keys"" that entitle owners to certain perks -- these perks will be fleshed out more fully in the future. One of those perks, apparently, is the ability to RSVP to this launch party. I personally find it interesting and bullish that PLBY is tying &lt;forbidden-token-phrase&gt; to IRL stuff, but that's besides the point: The news of the launch was made public here.

The link itself points to this:

https://preview.redd.it/lqhilx9bpq281.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e809e155df2b7a0f45ca5780da1d86757d32a18

While the news-of-the-news is known to people that follow PLBY pretty closely, the actual news that ""Playboy launches Centerfold, an OnlyFans competitor"" hasn't hit yet. When it does, it will likely hit some pretty high-profile news feeds. Hopefully when that happens -- which all signs point to being by EOW -- investors of all sorts will all take a closer look at just what the fuck Playboy Centerfold is, and if it's investment worthy.

# What is Centerfold?

https://preview.redd.it/2pgvdjsbpq281.png?width=1023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b1a237f9caa5bf6e184fb4d89f3a4ee12f43346

Centerfold will be a creator-driven social platform that allows creators to monetize themselves in a variety of ways:

* Subscription-based content, like OnlyFans.
* An anti-censorship platform to post content, like Instagram but without your account getting randomly deleted for showing a nipple.
* A platform that drives revenue through PLBY's other assets

As covered in [my previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/), I think it has a ton of potential that I do not feel is priced in to the stock:

* It has the ability to, on short order, pull in revenues that outsize all of PLBY's current revenues. Yet, management has thus far used $0 as guidance in their forecasts for '22.
* In August OnlyFans fucked up by saying they wouldn't allow sexual explicit content. They later reverted that decision, but the reputational damage was done. The timing is perfect for creators to take flight from OF to a more trustworthy platform that would never threaten their business, and whose entire purpose is to allow creators to monetize themselves in multiple ways.
* Much more info in [my previous dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/).

# Why will it be newsworthy?

I expect there to be an official PR release, which means it hits the ticker's news feeds. In that PR release, I think there will be a few things highlighted:

* Names of creators and ambassadors.  Up until now, we only know they consist of group with over 300M followers, and 100s of millions of $GMV. If some high profile names drop, like Cardi B, it could become some pretty high profile news!
* Specifics on the intended use cases, how closely it competes with OnlyFans/Instagram (eg, the content policy), etc.
* Lots of bullish remarks on revenue potential, cultural significance, etc.

# Other things of note

## Image of the stock

You might think that the news-of-the-news is already priced in... I don't. I still think the *vast majority* of investors have no clue Playboy was planning on launching an OnlyFans competitor, and that this launch will attract a lot of new blood into the stock. This news drop can be a turning point for the stock, changing it's reputation from a dying publisher to a tech-focused company with very high cultural relevance and brand value.

The options chain is starting to get pretty jacked up. Gamma values are at 0.36% float per 1% price move -- and a whopping 3.00%+ of daily volume. There is also significant Vanna potential here:  If MMs start to hedge more aggressively due to higher volatility, they'll have to buy a significant amount of shares, at least until we hit the $50 range.

While I think the launch will be incredibly bullish, it's possible it can be a dud. Any or all of these might occur:

* The site itself is a disappointment. Shitty design, slow load time, crappy feature set, etc.
* The content policy is insufficient to compete with OF. If they don't allow female masturbation, for example. (However, I still think competing with Insta is a pretty large market -- a lot of pretty vanilla creators have their Insta accounts regularly deleted due to tiny bits of nudity.)

But it's also Playboy... I think they can scope out good tits from bad tits. I think it'll be an interesting mix. Expect some weirdos, though, and realize that some of this is a positive thing as it attracts the very sex-positive and liberal crowd of actual money-making creators.

Friday's action pushed most U.S. equity markets into oversold territory on a short-term basis- so we suspect a counter-trend rally will materialize to make for some very choppy trading this week. Bottom Line in our view- there is more to go in this correction, although it will likely be interrupted by violent counter-trend rallies along the way. We are still looking for next support on the S&amp;P 500 toward the 4500-4600 range (watch the 50-day moving average near 4550), to be followed by the 4300-4400 range - which is the SPX's widely followed 200-day moving average. From the recent highs of 4744, a decline to the 4300 zone would equate to a nominal drop of roughly -9%, in-line with both our projected range and what would be considered a 'normal' correction in a secular bull market. Remember- the markets had been very overbought / frothy coming into this situation- and we noted just last week that leadership was generating some bearish signals on the charts (negative divergences, outside negative days). We had been looking for a bigger repricing in the markets since the August timeframe- but only witnessed a generally mild pullback in Sept/Oct. We believe there remains enough macro uncertainty to warrant corrections in the magnitude of -10-15%, possibly more- although we do not expect a repeat of the 2020 black swan crash (-35-40%) in 2022. There are a number of potential support zones for the S&amp;P 500 if selling pressures escalate further in sessions ahead. First, we would watch the area around the rising 50-day moving average just under 4550- Watch the 50-day MA for next potential support... Starting near 4300, we see 3 potential support areas ahead for the S&amp;P 500 50-day MA at the 4530-4550 level; Minor trend line and 30-week MA (not shown) near 4400; 200-day MA at 4300",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r5nzq8/spx_janney_technical_view/

This makes it very likely that Centerfold will actually launch before then. I believe the launch will be a news-worthy event and will draw a lot of eyes to the stock. 

For my original DD on Playboy, see the previous DD: [ =  -- $PLBY hitting an inflection point, and will challenge OnlyFans and Instagram in early December.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/)

# What's the opportunity?

**Up until now, Centerfold has just been a little known concept and something in the pipeline -- not even remotely on the radar of most investors. On launch, it will become a reality, an official news event, and investors will decide just how much real potential it holds for PLBY stock. In my opinion, the ability to invest in an OnlyFans competitor capable of pulling in 9+ digits of recurring revenue on short order is appealing.**

On Friday at 9:00pm, this message was sent to holders of Rabbitars, PLBY's NFT project that pulled in millions in Q3. These NFTs are meant to be ""membership keys"" that entitle owners to certain perks -- these perks will be fleshed out more fully in the future. One of those perks, apparently, is the ability to RSVP to this launch party. I personally find it interesting and bullish that PLBY is tying NFTs to IRL stuff, but that's besides the point: The news of the launch was made public here.

The link itself points to this:

While the news-of-the-news is known to people that follow PLBY pretty closely, the actual news that ""Playboy launches Centerfold, an OnlyFans competitor"" hasn't hit yet. When it does, it will likely hit some pretty high-profile news feeds. Hopefully when that happens -- which all signs point to being by EOW -- investors of all sorts will all take a closer look at just what the fuck Playboy Centerfold is, and if it's investment worthy.

# What is Centerfold?

&amp;#x200B;

Centerfold will be a creator-driven social platform that allows creators to monetize themselves in a variety of ways:

* Subscription-based content, like OnlyFans.
* An anti-censorship platform to post content, like Instagram but without your account getting randomly deleted for showing a nipple.
* A platform that drives revenue through PLBY's other assets

As covered in [my previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/), I think it has a ton of potential that I do not feel is priced in to the stock:

* It has the ability to, on short order, pull in revenues that outsize all of PLBY's current revenues. Yet, management has thus far used $0 as guidance in their forecasts for '22.
* In August OnlyFans fucked up by saying they wouldn't allow sexual explicit content. They later reverted that decision, but the reputational damage was done. The timing is perfect for creators to take flight from OF to a more trustworthy platform that would never threaten their business, and whose entire purpose is to allow creators to monetize themselves in multiple ways.
* Much more info in [my previous dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9w1b/).

# Why will it be newsworthy?

I expect there to be an official PR release, which means it hits the ticker's news feeds. In that PR release, I think there will be a few things highlighted:

* Names of creators and ambassadors.  Up until now, we only know they consist of group with over 300M followers, and 100s of millions of $GMV. If some high profile names drop, like Cardi B, it could become some pretty high profile news!
* Specifics on the intended use cases, how closely it competes with OnlyFans/Instagram (eg, the content policy), etc.
* Lots of bullish remarks on revenue potential, cultural significance, etc.

# Other things of note

## Image of the stock

You might think that the news-of-the-news is already priced in... I don't. I still think the *vast majority* of investors have no clue Playboy was planning on launching an OnlyFans competitor, and that this launch will attract a lot of new blood into the stock. This news drop can be a turning point for the stock, changing it's reputation from a dying publisher to a tech-focused company with very high cultural relevance and brand value.

The options chain is starting to get pretty jacked up. Gamma values are at 0.36% float per 1% price move -- and a whopping 3.00%+ of daily volume. So, if underlying goes up, the purchasing of shares to delta hedge could move the price a bit more.

There is also significant Vanna potential here:  If MMs start to hedge more aggressively due to higher volatility, they'll have to buy a significant amount of shares, at least until we hit the $50 range.

Given the low daily volume of the stock, I think options activity and hedging can have a fairly high impact on the stock's price. In other words, if the catalyst does indeed push the underlying share price up, I think the outstanding options will provide some further boost to share price.

PTON has seen similar flows the last two weeks and also with the 6100 Jan. 2023 $90 calls bought for $3.6M on 11/16 that are currently -25% while 2500 January 2023 $45 puts were sold to open on 11/9 and 12,000 January 2024 $50 calls have accumulated in OI since 11/8. PTON gapped sharply lower on earnings recently but showing some bullish RSI and A/D divergences on the daily. The long-term chart shows the $43 level as potential weekly support retesting a former flag breakout from 2020 while $30.50 is a much stronger node of support. Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world that pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes. PTON has been focused on rolling out its Bike+ and Tread products and sees a longer term path towards 100M subscribers and PTON feels it is currently only 7% penetrated into its addressable markets. PTON should be able to generate 35-40% hardware margins and 75-85% subscription margins with a long-term path to 40% EBITDA margins. PTON also recently acquired Aiqudo, Atlas Wearables, and Otari adding expertise in wearable devices, artificial intelligence, digital voice assistants, and interactive workout mats. PTON now has a market cap of $14.44B and is trading 3X EV/Sales though still 89X FY23 EBITDA estimates with profitability seen ramping 2023-2026 while revenues expected to rise 15% in 2022 after jumping 99%, 110%, 99.6% and 120.3% the last four years. Analysts have an average target of $75 with short interest at 11.4% of the float rising 29.5% Q/Q. PTON recently did a $1B offering which removes a near-term overhang and Baird added to Fresh Picks seeing improving catalysts in the quarters ahead and has a $90 target.

We are having huge supply chain issues at the moment. Trucker shortage is a huge problem. The solution? Self driving trucks.

Most of these AV companies have nice tech, but have their head so far up their ass they lack the proper business model. Self driving taxis are not nearly as profitable as a self driving truck. Not to mention, highway driving is significantly more scalable, with the trucker simply taking over at a stop, which he will then drive into the city.

Aurora is the solution to our supply chain issues. They focus on autonomous trucks oppose to taxis. They already partnered up with fedex to create a route from Dallas to Houston. They could potentially change our entire supply chain.

I think this is one to buy and hold for the next ten years.

[Nike](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/nike-teams-up-with-roblox-to-create-a-virtual-world-called-nikeland-.html) and [Adidas](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/24/metaverse-platform-the-sandboxs-sand-token-surges-25-after-adidas-teases-of-partnership/) are among the leaders in this metaverse land grab.

The Sandbox and Decentraland are the leading blockchain metaverse platform. Shopping and attending concerts in the metaverse are trending.  

Interest in the metaverse reached a new peak today when Republic Realm, a company the develops property in the metaverse, paid $4.3 million for land in The Sandbox. That's a metaverse record, according to data from [NonFungible.com](https://nonfungible.com/market/history?utm_term=non-fungible-token&amp;utm_campaign=United+States+-+Generic&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=7576959523&amp;hsa_cam=13059120396&amp;hsa_grp=127463896532&amp;hsa_ad=520895262610&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-1210599849809&amp;hsa_kw=non-fungible-token&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8IeBgI7A9AIVFh6tBh01qwgMEAAYASAAEgK53fD_BwE).  That deal broke a record set last week by a subsidiary of Canadian investment firm [Tokens.com](https://Tokens.com) Corp, which shelled out some $2.5 million for land in Decentraland.

The purchase, according to [Tokens.com](https://Tokens.com) CEO Andrew Kiguel, is like buying land in Manhattan years ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r5mpcb/nike_and_adidas_woke_up_one_morning_felt_around/

[GameStop share price soars as the market plummets](https://preview.redd.it/lzozqkotzp281.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81ef30ec9136edfe38606c71bf0e9154fbe9deb)

There may indeed only be a few business hours left to go long before something crazy happens.  Gamestop's negative beta does predict that it will rise when the market falls.  It does statistically serve as a future predictor, against what the shills will tell you.  Short interest has been revealed to be 113%. More shares have been shorted than actually exist in the float. This is evidence of illicit activity via the use of synthetic shares; naked shorting.

The Gamestop short-covering was bound to happen in January 2021, yet it was prevented via the removal of the buy button.  This is when the lying hedge funds like Citadel securities and Melvin Capital should have bought to cover.  Instead, they allowed retail mom and pop shareholders to burn instead of taking responsibility for their malicious attack on an innocent company.  Not only did they commit fraud then, via the removal of the buy button at the expense of retail shareholders, but they doubled down on their short position. This is egregious, insidious, and indicative of a corrupt market.  Remember, this is AFTER Citadel and Robinhood were let go by a corrupt judge after what happened in January 2021.

It is within my opinion that the new short covering will, and very well should, send shockwaves through global markets.  How high will the stock go on any real short covering?  Will it immediately jump above the fair $80 Billion market cap predicted by GMEdd . com?

As free traders, why wouldn't markets be worth testing these real limits if they're proven to be corrupt?  Why would anybody choose to play in an unfair game, where the referees have it rigged?

I personally believe that $GME is henceforth to be known as the greatest market hedge, and perhaps greatest money making opportunity against the backdrop of a crashing market, of all time.

I'm not smart enough to tell you exactly why. I could give you some BS theory about how the dollar rising and high yield bonds falling is telling us liquidity is drying up but then why is the reverse repo markets still on the fricking moon?

But with that out of the way let me introduce you retail traders into what I believe is an incredibly undervalued Infectious disease, psychedelics, and cannabinoid bio tech firm Revive Therapeutics (RVVTF)

I could talk up this stock all day, but who gives a damn about Reddit user SunnySideSaLum. Although you should care about what Forbes said in their recent article covering the company. Heres a shorter summary (link attached if youd like to read the whole thing)

 Revives would-be Covid treatment hinges on Bucillamine, which has been approved for use in South Korea and Japan for rheumatoid arthritis for the past 30 years. Bucillamine displaysstrong evidence in vitroof preventing SARS-COV-2 virusdocking onto the ACE2 receptors, which is the primary gateway of the SARS-COV-2 virus into human cells. Researchpublished on July 1, 2021 confirms thiol-based mucolytics, which are similar to Bucillamine, also displayed potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 binding via disulfide reduction.

So, unlike the antiviral drugs being developed by the larger pharmaceutical companies that seek to address viral replication itself, Bucillamine may address that while also preventing the SARS-COV-2 virus from entering host cells.

Revive has recently decided toincorporate viral load testingfor a minimum of 300 patients that will be enrolled in the current Phase 3 study. The viral load will allow Revive to quantify the speed at which Bucillamine can reduce viral infection of patients throughout the course of treatment, thus allowing to understand the most optimal time to introduce Bucillamine in the treatment course and provide confidence in the potential utility and effectiveness of Bucillamine in Covid.

Should the companys goal of reducing viral load testing prove to be effective, Bucillamine could be in a favorable position to receive emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA. If it were approved, it is a strong indication that Bucillamine can indeed arrest viral loaddirectly, not just treat Covid symptoms.Ideally, regulators would like to see proof of both mechanisms of action at work to declare a heightened baseline of efficacy. 

Their CEO Micheal Frank ended with this 

We recognize the market opportunity for Bucillamine and we are in discussions with our manufacturing partners to ensure that billions of Bucillamine tablets can be made available in 2022 to support our future commercialization partners and the millions of people globally, Frank added.

If you have more questions and would like to see fancy graphs please go to the RVVTF subreddit, there are great guys there who are much more knowledgeable then me and can answer a lot of your questions.

In conclusion, Im not one to gamble, but if theres a Penny stock to gamble on, for me, its most certainly this one. The upsides of this company EVEN IF THEY DONT GET EUA are impressive. Ill be holding this one for a while.

1,"11/30/2021, 13:51:52",Whack the CACC: I want to short the auto lending industry.,HalfEpic,"Auto loans provide the largest lending demand behind student loans &amp; house mortgages. Automobiles are essential and there is an insane demand for them right now. I looked into retail sales and non-EV markets after watching the Big Short while waiting for some big pharma focus pills to kick in. 

Around 70% of new cars &amp; 50% of used are bought with a payment plan. The level of prime to subprime loans are about 7:5 and the lenders net loss rate, pre-covid, was steadily rising to almost 10% on both prime and subprime loans. Startlingly, the net loss on prime loans was beginning to pass the subprime. They are both around 5% right now, though this level has been touched a couple times in the last 4 years. 60+ day delinquency rates show almost the same figure, landing around the 4% mark with prime loans being slightly above subprime. 

My concern starts with the level of rising subprime loans that were defaulting before covid. Lenders in 2019/20 were even getting downgraded on their loans AAA ratings for the first time in years. This would normally cause some price strain between vehicle manufacturers, dealerships, lenders, and consumers. Now introduce the pandemic.

 Between stimulus checks, COVID tax credits, and rising wages in a good economy, people have savings and confidence to spend it. My coworker pays $500/month for his (pre-pandemic) car payment, and we have the same job and I cant even afford to move out. Now we have a supply chain issues for chips, steel, vehicle storage, shipping, even the fucking foam they use for seats is locked up cause they started making masks. You have used cars selling for 100% markup and new cars cost about the same someones annual earned income.  The salespeople I know say a lot of their customers, especially taking subprime loans, dont fully understand what theyre signing. If this loan doesnt fuck them, their insurance rates will. On top of that, dealerships demand for auctioned used cars is drying up and theyre only turning 3-figure net profit on cars. 

Now lets look at the pools of auto loans in asset backed securities. Lots of liquidity because we are having the best bull run we will see in our lifetimes and auto loan ABS have investment advantages like overcollateralization. But I say fuck all that, the people buying now are idiots and many of them will either default on their loans or sell their car at a significant loss. Add that to a market that is transitioning into value and the impending govt. rate increases, global economic events, and manufacturing supply chain issues not being resolved for a minimum of 2 years. Within that time frame we will have a readjustment of the US market to rate increases, heightened lunar activity in 2024, and can likely expect at least one studio album and 2 mixtapes from Lil Yachty, if not a complete Renaissance. 


TL;DR

We saw the first AAA securities backed by auto loans get downgraded right before the pandemic hit. People are using stimmy savings to buy all the cars at high prices on a payment plan. Lots of them will default as the economy stabilizes and we can expect auto lenders to be put under pressure. 

Positions:
5x SC long puts at strikes 45-30. 
Proceeding with observation, I'm expecting to see some action mid-2022. Their subsidiary is setting up a fucking digital currency ETF in Spain so there is that....
Watching for entry into CACC long puts. 

 I might just be seeing something big to short because Im looking for one. Let me know your thoughts.

1,"11/30/2021, 13:26:58",Alpha Call: Paysafe - Buy in for the long term iGaming and Emerging Market play,Ok_Commission_3368,"  

 *Disclaimer: Not a financial advice; just my view and interpretations.* 

**Paysafe** is a fintech company founded in the UK in 1996 focused on specialized and high-risk verticals including iGaming and Cry\*to among other payment segments. In the trailing twelve months (TTM) the Company made \~$1.5 Bn in Revenues, adjusted EBITDA of $434 Mn and net loss of $200 Mn. 

**Paysafe is currently at a dirt-cheap valuation.** 

About 75% of the revenues are from the high-risk verticals of iGaming and Emerging Markets (which include stock, FX and cry\*to trading, direct marketing, which can include nutraceuticals and multi-level marketing, travel and entertainment, integrated payments and digital goods). These are high-growth areas and Paysafe is well among the first-movers in this space. Going in first comes with its own set of problems and benefits. Regulation is still in the nascent stage and that is what is currently troubling the business. Once the business gets going and the governments and businesses agree on how to do their business this very well looks like a money-maker.

**Key Managerial Personnel**

&amp;#x200B;

**Regulatory Restrictions:**

In Europe there has been a wave of new regulations coming through. The regulations that have affected the Company the most are (as mentioned in the Q3 21 earnings call)

1. In Germany, there is a cap on how much a single person can bet. So, when the Company caters to higer-end betters, this cap has a pretty high impact.

2. Again, in Germany, the tax on many casino and poker games have made games frankly unprofitable for the Operators.

3. The Operators in Germany are getting adjusted to the new regulations and getting locally licensed.

4. Given the market size of Germany, it is a pretty large market for PaySafe and they took a big hit here. (The company did not provide the exact numbers/split-up of Europes market)

5. In Holland, only a very small number of operators are going to be given license and the payment types are also limited. There is a lot activity there to get this reversed.

**Debt Concern:**

One another concern for Paysafe is their high debt position in their Balance Sheet. They are made to cough up about $180 Mn during the TTM in Interest Expenses. The management is cognizant of this issue and is focused on reducing this. They generated an impressive **Free Cash Flow of $350 Mn** in the trailing twelve months period and using the excess cash flow to reduce debt. The management is focusing on reducing the debt and has a stated objective of bringing it down to 3.5 times of EBITDA; it is currently at 4.5 times. 

The Companys free cash flow conversion is pretty high and they are committed to pay down debt as fast as they can with the excess cash flow.

**Growth Opportunities:**

The global iGaming payments market is projected to grow at a 12% CAGR (excluding North America and China) from $77 Bn (2020) to $135 Bn (2025) while the U.S. is projected to grow at a CAGR of 50%+ from 2019 to 2025 (as per EDC and H2 Gambling Capital) and a potential to reach $50 Bn in volume by 2025 in North America. The market is only now opening up and Paysafes iGaming services are already live in 14 states and used by over 34 operatorsrepresenting approximately 75% of all iGaming operators in the U.S. market. The operators served in the US include DraftKings and the state lotteries of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, New Hampshire, North Carolina and North Dakota. 

PaySafe has great opportunities for growth in the disruptive areas of iGaming and Cry\*to. The new regulations and opening up of the markets in these areas are creating some new and mostly likely temporary hurdles for the growth of the Company. But being a very big player with backers like BlackStone and William Foley, Paysafe is definitely a good candidate for turning their business around and get on the high growth opportunities of their disruptive business segments in which they operate.

The bottom-line is Paysafe is betting big on iGaming and Cry\*to and that is a bet to buy-in. 

**Valuation:**

The current share price puts the Companys valuation at $2.7 Bn and the Enterprise Value at $4.7 Bn. The Companys TTM revenue is \~$1.5 Bn and Adjusted EBITDA is $434 Mn. While the valuation during their SPAC listing might have been high, they have come down by more than 60% since those time and more than 80% from its all-time high of $19.5/Share. To buy the fintech play in the iGaming and Cry\*to (Emerging markets) space, Paysafe is at the right price to buy and play the long term game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r5fslk/alpha_call_paysafe_buy_in_for_the_long_term/

-	Safe Haven  An asset that provides safety from risk
  - Risk is exposure to bad contingencies. Most of these will never happen, but they can and they can appear in any number of forms
    - Investment risk is the potential for loss, and the scope of that loss
      - A Safe haven asset is an investment that mitigates that risk to preserve and protect your capital. They are shelters from financial storms
-	Safe haven investing is both a defensive measure to avert future loss and an offensive one to exploit future opportunities with &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot;.
-	A risk mitigation strategy must be cost effective. Anyone can develop a strategy that does well in a down market, but we must not have a cure that is worse than the disease
-	Benjamin Graham  &amp;quot;The essence of investment management is the management of risks, not the management of returns.&amp;quot;
-	Do not attempt what Spitznagel does as a retail investor or even professional.
-	Everett Klipp - &amp;quot;A small loss is a good loss.&amp;quot; Risk mitigation and survival are everything in investing. Don&amp;#39;t try to predict
-	Investing needn&amp;#39;t be about making grandiose forecasts. No one has a crystal ball
-	A cost-effective safe haven doesn&amp;#39;t just slash risk, it actually lets you take more risk in other parts of the portfolio
-	Aristotle pointed out that, while it is easy to make a couple lucky rolls of a die, with 10,000 repeated rolls, the &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; of the die evens out
-	When your sample size is small, and even worse, unique and unrepeatable, no matter your subjective probabilities, there is so much noise in sample you can hardly know anything. You are hoping for good luck. Your Number (N) is 1
-	But if your success or failure relying on many outcomes, over many rolls of the dice. Your Number (N) is large. You are acting as the &amp;quot;House&amp;quot; exploiting the house edge through repetition to quash randomness. The house doesn&amp;#39;t gamble. We are as Poker theorist David Sklansky said, &amp;quot;at war with luck.&amp;quot;
-	Cost-effective risk mitigation or raising our compound growth rates (CAGR) and thus wealth through lower risk is really our comprehensive goal as investors.
-	Golden Theorem  As you accumulate more and more data in a random sample, you should expect the sample&amp;#39;s average to converge to the true average.
  - The more you roll a fair 6-sided die, the more the percentage of all those rolls in which you see any particular number will converge toward 1/6 or 16.66%
-	It isn&amp;#39;t just the single wager that matters, it is the iterative, multiplicative impact of that result on the next wager, and on the next! A large loss disproportionately lowers our geometric average return, because it leaves us with a much lower stake, or capital base to reinvest and compound on the next wager.
-	We cannot only judge our decisions by their outcomes. As good decisions can have bad outcomes. But we only get 1 outcome.
-	We have just one life (N=1), but our fate is a range of outcomes.
-	The most intuitive way for us to think about the meaning of the expected geometric average return and, equivalently, the geometric average ending wealth outcome under multiplicative growth is simply as the expected median ending wealth outcome
-	The geometric average return, rather than the arithmetic average return is close to what you should expect from random samples from all possible ending outcomes
-	By giving all the weight to this path(N=1), we essentially need to have gotten pretty much every possible path right. We must be robust to the realized path or &amp;quot;covered all the bases.&amp;quot; We don&amp;#39;t know what &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; we are going to get
-	Not all losses and not all risks are created equal, so not all risk mitigation is created equal
-	We need a risk-mitigation strategy that makes our returns both more accurate and more precise to win the bloody &amp;quot;war with luck.&amp;quot; We want a tighter grouping of our expected return or a reduced variance.
-	You have 2 options for achieving this. The store of value method or the insurance method. These 2 strategies can be very different in their cost-effectiveness
-	What makes something a safe haven vs a non-safe haven?
  - How does it do during a Crash? +/-
  - How does it do during normal times? +/-
  - What is the expected payoff during a crash and how does it achieve it?
-	You have 3 different types of safe havens.
  - Store of Value  Fixed in time and space. Key is low to no correlation. It provides both a cushion and &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot; should a crash take place. It is basically a matter of diluting risk. Crash return is +/0, Non-Crash Return is +/-, and Payoff type is low correlation
  - Alpha  Is like store of value, but its correlation is now expected to be negative. That means during a crash, it is expected to generate a positive return. Think of the flight to quality we see during a crash. Crash return is +, non-Crash return is +/-, Payoff type is negative correlation
  - Insurance  What Mark Spitznagel does, don&amp;#39;t try. Extreme version of the Alpha payoff. Needs to make a very large profit during a crash, relative to its expected losses the rest of the time. Needs to be highly convex to crashes or have an explosive payoff to justify its costs. Crash return is ++++, non-Crash return is -, Payoff type is &amp;quot;Convexity&amp;quot;
-	Safe Havens can be exceedingly costly, so much so that, as a cure, they can be worse than the disease.
-	Some safe havens require a very large asset allocation within the portfolio. The problem is large AA comes at a very large cost (drag) when times are good (which is most of the time). Gold has this problem.
-	Strategic vs Tactical Safe Haven
  - Strategic  Mitigates systemic risks in a more fixed way and letting it play out
  - Tactical  Requires moving into and out of safe havens. This requires timing and short-term forecasting skill (which people don&amp;#39;t have)
-	The problem is no one possess a &amp;quot;crystal ball&amp;quot; to know when to do this.
  - If you risk-mitigation strategy requires a crystal ball to work, then you are doing it all wrong. Don&amp;#39;t try to predict the market. Cost effective safe haven investing needs to be agnostic investing
-	Cassandras typically and ironically lose more in their safety from looming crashes than those crashes would have even harmed them.
-	Markets scare us more than they harm us
-	Markets are very, very good at making us feel safe when we shouldn&amp;#39;t and scared when we needn&amp;#39;t
-	Risk mitigation therefore needs to be a sustained way of life or habit, not a transient one
-	Imposter Safe Havens
  - Hopeful
  - Unsafe
  - Diworsification (Diversification)
-	Hopeful  Payoff is very unreliable. Requires a lot of luck to pay off in a crash. Sometimes requires good timing. It is like jumping out of an airplane with a parachute that only sometimes deploys, you are better off not wearing one in the first place and making a more informed decision. Crash return is (don&amp;#39;t know??), non-Crash return is +/- and the Payoff type is &amp;quot;Fingers Crossed&amp;quot;
-	Unsafe  This asset or strategy has so far always gone up, so it likely has a good story for why that should always be the case. This logic is then extended to their performance in a crash. They are often vulnerable in a crash, perhaps they have even shown some evidence of that vulnerability, but this doesn&amp;#39;t change the optimism around their safe haven status. It is like jumping out of an airplane and thinking you can fly. Crash return is -, non-Crash return is +, and payoff type is &amp;quot;Always goes up so it must be safe&amp;quot;
-	Diworsifier  Most common form you see in modern finance. It is pervasive throughout almost all investment portfolios. Diversification is fundamentally a dilution of risk, not a solution to risk. It is about evading risk. Diversification never tends to be as great (lower correlations) as it appears. When the investing herd heads for the exits in a crisis, most strategies and assets tend to get swept away. Strategies that were once uncorrelated, stable and liquid become the opposite of all those things as investors are forced to sell what they are able to, all at the same time. Diversification is &amp;quot;NOT A FREE LUNCH&amp;quot; as mentioned in modern finance theory. Crash return is -, non-Crash return is +, Payoff type is &amp;quot;Loses less, so it is worth it&amp;quot;
-	Diversification lowers returns in the name of higher Sharpe ratios, some investors who use this strategy but aren&amp;#39;t content with the lower returns are then forced to apply leverage in hopes of raising them back up. True risk mitigation should not require financial engineering and leverage in order to both lower risk and raise CAGR. Doing so adds a different kind of risk by magnifying the portfolio&amp;#39;s sensitivity to errors in those correlation estimates.
-	Aristotle  &amp;quot;The whole is not the same as the sum of its parts.&amp;quot;
  - This is true in finance. You can move a portion of your portfolio to an asset with zero expected return and away from an asset with a high expected return and raise the whole of your wealth, even though it lowered your average. All of this is due to compounding. Key Point of Book!!!
-	The properties emerge from the interactions of those component assets as they are rebalanced and compounded. Safe Havens adding so much ending wealth to the portfolio (geometric return) is due to the iterative nature of the game. They provide capital for the next &amp;quot;dice roll&amp;quot; by resetting or rebalancing the size of the wager at the end of each &amp;quot;dice roll&amp;quot;. Safe havens can thus top up or feed the wagers in the main game (large part of portfolio), particularly if the previous roll resulted in a big loss, without costing the frequent positive wagers enough to matter. The assets now interact, rather than act independently. Thus, an entirely new whole is formed, one that is very different from the sum of its parts.
-	If we only look at the way that things happened and obsess over it as the only likely outcome, then we are engaged in nave empiricism. IE - we over-extrapolate the past
-	To avoid that we need to look at the past in the context of the many other paths that COULD HAVE happened, but never did, as well as our sensitivities to those outcomes
-	Most investors add a risk-mitigation strategy for its effect, but don&amp;#39;t properly account for the cost paid to gain that effect and thus don&amp;#39;t account for the net portfolio effect
-	There is always this risk-mitigation tension or tradeoff between the two contrary forces of cost and effectiveness (IE  arithmetic costs and geometric return). That tradeoff is between lower arithmetic returns (costs) as payment for the geometric pickup (effect). There is NO FREE LUNCH!!! But if can tilt that tradeoff in your favor, with an effect that outpaces the costs resulting in a positive net portfolio effect, then risk mitigation on net raises compounding and consequently, wealth. This is cost effective risk mitigation.
-	Remember, anyone can develop an asset or strategy that does well in a crash, the trick though is to do it while also raising the median return. Most risk mitigation strategies fail this portion
-	We cannot judge the cost effectiveness of a given risk mitigation strategy on its own, in a vacuum, based solely on its attributes.
-	The bigger the crash bang for the buck, the less that is needed and the less its potential drag or cost when it isn&amp;#39;t needed.
-	Mechanical vs Statistical payoff
  - Mechanical  is one that happens as a direct, intrinsic consequence. IE  an option going into the money from out of the money. It must go up in value.
  - Statistical  is one that only tends to be so, based on observed history, but it needn&amp;#39;t be so. It is more extrinsic and thus noisier. This would be like a flight to quality or safety that we see during a crash
-	You also have other possibilities for payoff warping, like counterparty risk (or the risk of not getting paid). Gold bullion has no counter park risk.
-	The question to ask yourself is do you need a lot of things to go right for a safe-haven to be effective? Is their history a good guide to their future, or is everything always different?
-	An ideal safe-haven is more mechanical but real-world payoffs tend to be much less so. They tend to fall somewhere on a spectrum between mechanical and statical.
-	Not Safe Havens
  - VIX futures  Volatility index but they are always in contango which causes them to have a very steep &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot; making them a really bad trade
  - High-Dividend Stocks
  - Hedge Funds
  - Fine Art
  - US Farmland
-	Only 2 safe havens are worthy of that name  Gold and Equity Tail Hedge
-	Store of Value
  - Cash (3-Month Treasury Bill)  Less interest rate risks than longer dated maturities. Not a safe haven
  - 10-20 Year Bonds (Typical of &amp;quot;Balanced&amp;quot; portfolio)  More interest rate risks vs shorter maturities (as of 2021 those rates are extremely low which hurts their current safe haven status), classic flight to safety asset when things turn bad for the stock market and the economy. They are a hopeful haven or a Diworsification
-	Alpha
  - CTA (Commodity Trading Advisors)  Active managed strategies (usually hedge funds) and trend following strategies. Attempt to capture Alpha by using momentum. Other derivatives-based strategies use similar strategies like long volatility and generic tail hedging. Not a safe haven
-	Insurance
  - Gold  Hedge against the banking system. No counter party risk. Historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. But, is a very noisy hedge against inflation. It is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (When inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices). Mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&amp;#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&amp;#39;s. Gold is all about investors&amp;#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value. It is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value. Its payoff profile is largely statistical as expected. During the 1970&amp;#39;s, golds payoff profile made it very cost effective as a safe haven, outside of that, gold has been much less cost effective. Gold has required a tactical call regarding inflation or real interest rates in order to be a cost-effective safe haven. This means we need certain things to go right for gold to be an effective safe haven in mitigating systemic risk (of a crash), much less cost-effective. The amount of gold needed to fully hedge our portfolio is very high adding to its carry costs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r5f42x/safe_haven_by_mark_spitznagel_part_1/

**The Little Book of Common-Sense Investing**

-	Buffet  Newtons 4th law of motion. Investor return decrease as motion increases.
-	Winning Strategy for investing is to buy a fund that holds all market portfolio and hold it forever
-	The index fund eliminates the risks of individual stocks, market sectors, and manager selection. Only stock market risk remains, which is large
-	A traditional index fund operates with minimal expenses, no advisory fees, with tiny portfolio turnover, and high tax efficiency.
-	Investing in equities long term is a winner&amp;#39;s game
-	The returns earned by business are ultimately translated into the stock market
-	Investing is a zero-sum game, for every person that beats the market by 1% someone else lost by 1%.
-	Mutual fund investors are confident they can easily select the right fund managers. They are WRONG
-	When the stock temporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number of shareholders receive outsized benefits at the expense of those they trade with. Over time, the aggregate gains made must of necessity match the business gains of the company
-	The stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. But this goes up and down in cycles. As investors are willing to pay higher or lower P/E.
-	Investment yield on stocks (dividends plus dividend earnings growth) tracks with the total market return. About 9.5% for the last 100 years
-	Reversions to the mean  Tendency for P/E ratios to return to their long-term norms over time.
-	Economics controls the long-term stock market return. Emotions control the short term. Accurately predicting short term emotions is impossible
-	Occam&amp;#39;s razor  when there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the most simple
-	Solution  buy and hold a diversified, low cost portfolio that tracks the stock market
-	Investors as a group must earn precisely the market return, BEFORE THE COSTS OF INVESTING ARE DEDUCTED  when we subtract all the fees, turnover, taxes, commissions, sales loads, advertising, and legal fees  the returns of investors will fall short of the market by precisely those costs. The lower these costs the better
-	Before costs, beating the market is a zero-sum game, after costs, it is a loser&amp;#39;s game
-	Focus on the lowest cost funds  the more managers take, the less investors make
-	Don&amp;#39;t invest in funds based on past performance. Performance comes and goes. But costs go on forever
-	Costs
  - Expense Ratio
  - Sales Charge
  - Purchase and sale of securities or turnover
  - Assume the turnover costs equal 1% the turnover rate. IE - 100% turnover = 1%. 50% turnover = 0.5%
-	Low cost funds beat high cost funds
-	Most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.. why? Counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. Most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. Investors chase past performance.
-	Actively managed funds are tax inefficient due to turnover
-	Fund returns are devastated by costs, adverse fund section, bad timing, taxes and inflation
-	Don&amp;#39;t look for the needle, just buy the whole haystack
-	355 equity funds from 1970 to 2006  80% had gone out of business. Only 2 of the 355 funds had superior performance during this time (beat the index by 2%) 8 funds beat the index by 1%. The odds of you picking one of these funds is extremely low.
-	As the active fund does better, it has more inflows of cash which makes it difficult to maintain that advantage.
-	Picking a winner based on the past is hazardous duty
-	Over the long-term stocks have provided higher returns than bonds, so why own bonds?
  - Bonds have beat stocks in 42 of the last 112 years
  - They reduce volatility in the portfolio
-	Investors who seek to increase yields in their bonds by investing in junk bonds should be careful. If you are going to do it make it a very small percent of your portfolio.
-	Long term bonds are much more volatile than short term
-	Ben Graham  The average manager cannot obtain better results than the S+P 500. Investors should be content with earning the markets return. Only low-cost index investing can guarantee that outcome.
-	Asset allocation accounts for 94% of return. 2 factors that determine how you should allocate your portfolio
  - Ability to take risk  depends on financial position, liabilities, years. In general, you are able to take more risks the longer time horizon you have
  - Willingness to take risk  matter of preference. Some investors can handle the up and downs. If you can&amp;#39;t sleep at night, you have too much risk.
  - These two factors determine your risk tolerance
-	Rebalance portfolios at most once per year

1,"11/30/2021, 12:03:26",Imminent Stock Market Crash,Round_Use1988,"My thesis has several layers which provides a margin of safety ;  

1) Fed policy: Currently the fed is tapering and has said that if inflation persist they may increase the speed they taper. If you look at history every single time the fed tapered the market corrects (20+%). The same can be said when they Fed announces they are increasing QE, the market reverses a downtrend and continues on a bull run. This has proven to be 100% accurate in the US. The market is forward looking and sees this coming, IMO the market has already topped. Of course the Fed could reverse there decision and decide to continue QE for longer, if this occurs I will cover my short. 

 2) Stocks under pressure: ARKK ETF and the vast majority of speculative stocks are down 50-70%, these are the first to be hit when we extend to the end of a bull run, and the stock market participants are looking for a safe, cash flowing companies to ride into the end, that is essentially a flight to safety in anticipation of tapering and an increase in the funds rate.  

 3) Fed announced Taper: On November 3rd the fed announced the taper, since then we've seen stocks get smashed on any miss earnings and just the way the market is reacting to news has drastically changed. Most recent example is the new C19 variant, any potential bad news the market is no longer just brushing off, participants are confused and see the market as being irrational for no reason, where in fact the real reason is because of the TAPER. We will continue to see large draw downs on any negative news.  

4) Valuation: The FAANG stocks is holding up this market, as they are seen as the safest and best companies the world. This has pushed there valuations to ALL time highs. MSFT is trading at a 37 PE and 14 PS, not seen since the Dot Com bubble. Normal MSFT or AAPL trade at a PE of 12-18 and that was during the last decade where they had a massive run rate of growth ahead of them.   

5) Shift to small cap from large cap?: I have thought about the possibility of a shift away from large cap, allowing them to correct while small cap coming back into favour, keep the market propped up,  however EVERY SINGLE time MSFT has corrected or crashed the market does the same. So unless this is the first time we ever see this happen, It just isn't probable.  

6) Forward guidance: AAPLE is only expected to grow at 4% in 2022, and MSFT 15ish%. Demand has been pulled forward and we are going to see a reset in their valuations based on forward looking guidance, currently it is completely unsustainable and they have no way to grow into there valuations.  

7) Economic outlook: Inflation is rising which will put pressure on companies margins if they don't have pricing power. On top of this I expect we see a much weaker consumer in 2022/2023. The cost of living is rising significantly in every aspect of people's lives, leaving them with less disposable income to spend on non essentials. Any correction in the stock market or housing market would further pressure consumer confidence making them think twice about going on that vacation or buying a new Macbook etc..  

8) China: The Chinese economy is on the brink of collapse, the real estate giants such as Evergrande are barely meeting payments on interest. Evergrande has 300 billion in debt and is selling assets to meet interest obligations. Real estate sales are down 30% in October! The Chinese see the inevitable real estate crash as these giant companies fail, which will cause the economy to collapse and will have a ripple affect on the world. China is the #1 purchaser of commodities from countries around the world, as their economy slows they will purchase less ,which will put pressure on other countries GDP,  we have already seen a massive slow down in China doing just this!  

9) Market is currently crashing: The Russel 2000 peaked a couple weeks ago on November 8th and is already down 10%. In nearly ever case small cap lead a crash (not including black swan events) and the S&amp;P follow behind within a matter of weeks. Also; technical analysis on the FAANG stocks all show they were extremely over extended and have peaked, which would be very consistent with the Russell leading the crash and 2 weeks later (now) the FAANG beginning their crash.   Thank you for reading. Please poke holes in this thesis and invest at your own risk.  Don't fight the FED, adapt to their policy.

# What I failed to understand

We currently live in an era where access to capital (money) is dirt fucking cheap (i.e. low interest rates). If we look at a chart for the interest rates on corporate debt, we see that we've been in a secular decline since the 1980s. Hence, year after year, access to capital is getting cheaper and cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

So in an era of cheap capital, the big dick move is to reinvest all revenue back into the company and expand aggressively as possible. Company over spends one year? Who gives a fuck, we're growing revenues at 10, 20, 30% year over year. The interest rates on the debt is nothing compared to the revenue growth.

This is why growth stocks have absolutely crushed it since 2008. Old boomers will cry all day about the importance of ""profits"" but what they fail to realize is the times have changed. They grew up in an era where capital was becoming more and more scarce as interest rates marched higher and higher. When capital is scarce, profits and the accumulation of capital is everything.

""BUT WHAT ABOUT COMPANIES THAT MAKE FAT PROFITS, AND HAVE HIGH REVENUE GROWTH??""

Those make my pp extra hard (i.e. apple, google, microsoft). The important aspect to me however is they continue to have high revenue growth. I'd take revenue growth over profits any fucking day of the week.

In my opinion some of the greatest value investors of this decade will be investors that find companies where the market is greatly misunderstanding the companies future revenue growth. A recent example of this is Asana, where it was growing revenue at 80% per year, however the market cap was only 4 billion at IPO.

I am not sure but I am starting to think that my entire portfolio is crap. I've sold covered calls on some equities/stocks that don't expire until 2024. This strategy now seems to be pointless on some positions due to price paid for said stock and the options strike and expiration date. I feel like I am just paying the house margin fees with no hope of any real gains for said positions?

If I should be selling, then what should I sell? Or should I buy back the covered calls? I feel like I ducked everything up... I feel like the more I try to fix things, the worse I make them.

My other stocks, I am afraid to sell a covered calls on because the stocks dropped a lot from my initial buy in price. I am afraid that said stock will go ""TO THE MOON"" the moment I sell a covered call. If not to the moon, up considerably more than the profit I would receive from selling the covered call. This usually happens to me. Knowing when to sell the covered call would be good; any advice on that?

I am on margin and honestly feel like selling everything and starting over. Only problem with that idea, for me, is that a lot of the stocks I own are already at there lows. The lows were they are a good buy in; at least, in my opinion. When I sell at the low; they always go ""TO THE MOON"" or at least back to what I paid for them within a short amount of time.

So having said that, I don't know what to do and feel like I am just spinning my wheels, paying the house, and wasting opportunities.

**I would love to hear what moves you would make if you were holding my current positions. Does anyone here who actually knows what they are doing want to take a look at my portfolio an positions?**

I am not asking for ""investment advice"" just more of how to fix my strategies. And the big question, **are all my stocks/positions complete crap?**

&gt;When the clock stuck midnight on Nov. 29, tickets for Spider-Man: No Way Home went on sale. Within minutes domestic movie ticket sites began to crash as moviegoers rushed to snag seats for one of the most anticipated films of the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is something that the box office has not experienced since the pandemic began and a sign that with the right releases, the movie theater industry has a bright future, experts say.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pandemic battered cinemas, crushing demand and nearly bankrupting some of the industrys largest exhibitors. The box office has been slow to rebound, but sustained momentum over the last six months has provided confidence in an eventual recovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overnight, the latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a co-production between [Disney](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS) and [Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP), has sparked even more optimism. Ticketing sites like Atom Tickets, [Fandango](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA) and MovieTickets.com alongside movie theater sites like [AMC](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMC), [Cinemark](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CNK) and Regal saw a surge of demand for tickets leading many to crash or place visitors in hour-long online queues.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are different tiers of intense fan demand when it comes to box office pre-sales, and this film is clearly showing it belongs near the top with a select few others, said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. For anyone who doubted the communal draw of the theatrical experience over the past two years, look to this enthusiasm for Spider-Man as a major inflection point during the box office recovery period and the sign of a bright future ahead.  
&gt;  
&gt;This kind of fervor has not been seen at the box office since 2019 when advanced tickets for titles like Avengers: Endgame and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker went on sale.

I've sold covered calls on some equities/stocks that don't expire until 2024. This strategy now seems to be pointless on some positions due to price paid for said stock and the options strike and expiration date. I feel like I am just paying the house margin fees with no hope of any real gains for said positions? 

If I should be selling, then what should I sell? Or should I buy back the covered calls? I feel like I ducked everything up... I feel like the more I try to fix things, the worse I make them. 

My other stocks, I am afraid to sell a covered calls on because the stocks dropped a lot from my initial buy in price. I am afraid that said stock will go ""TO THE MOON"" the moment I sell a covered call. If not to the moon, up considerably more than the profit I would receive from selling the covered call. This usually happens to me. Knowing when to sell the covered call would be good; any advice on that? 

I am on margin and honestly feel like selling everything and starting over. Only problem with that idea, for me, is that a lot of the stocks I own are already at there lows. The lows were they are a good buy in; at least, in my opinion. When I sell at the low; they always go ""TO THE MOON"" or at least back to what I paid for them within a short amount of time. 

So having said that, I don't know what to do and feel like I am just spinning my wheels, paying the house, and wasting opportunities.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks rose and bonds fell as global markets regained their composure, with investors rethinking their worst-case scenarios for the Omicron coronavirus strain.
* The S&amp;P 500 recovered from Friday's rout and erased its November losses in a broad-based rally. The Nasdaq 100 rose more than 2%, led by gains in technology behemoths such as Apple. and Microsoft.
* The 10-year Treasury yields rose above 1.5%.
* Biden warned Americans not to panic over the new strain, saying that vaccines, booster shots, and masking are the best ways to keep people safe. According to the company's top executive, Pfizer will know how well its COVID-19 vaccine holds up against Omicron in two to three weeks, and even in the worst-case scenario, the existing formula will retain some efficacy against the heavily mutated strain.
* A forward-looking index of home purchases in the United States rose to a 10-month high in October, indicating steady housing demand. The pending home sales index of the National Association of Realtors increased 7.5% from the previous month. A major newswire survey of economists found that the median forecast was for a 1% increase.

VAXART (VXRT)  
Currently They're making a oral COVID vaccine aka a COVID pill.  
It broke resistance at the end of the bull flag after loading up the spring trap for over a year.

 So far in phase II recruiting but had promising Phase I results.

An executive is literally presenting it at the  World Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Congress Tuesday 11/30.

There is evidence insider activity on the quotes and evidence on heavy influence from hedge funds from the volatility and no news to support the volatility and short interest.

After Merck's disappointing news on the their HIV medication along with Pfizer's ramped up vaccine production after the Omicron discovery it would seem Vaxart is in a good position.

They separate themselves because it is not a treatment but rather a booster, instead of needles people can pop a pill. They apparently got around the problem of the stomach acid dissolving the pill before it can reach the small intestine. Also theoretically (since it has not been tested on humans) it can reduce symptoms.

I guess the takeaway is that no needles, it's a booster in a world where variants is spooking the population, and the results have been promising. Not to mention the obvious fact this thing could squeeze between now and 12/12, but most likely after the conference.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r5a55g/is_there_a_reason_why_this_isnt_of_any_interest/

Do you actively trade within the same account that you keep your long term investments in or do you maintain multiple brokerage accounts in order to separate your swing trades/day trades from your long term investments? When I say long term investments Im not referring to your IRA/retirement investments. 

Im debating on if I want to open multiple accounts or keep everything under one account because there are pros and cons to each strategy. If I only maintain one account that contains both of my investments and trading activity then it will make everything simple and consolidated. However, I also understand that keeping my trading account separate, can help with risk management by ensuring that I only trade with 10% of my full portfolio balance without touching any of the funds that I have for long term investing. 

Also, one side note. I am a accountant and Im big on tracking everything within excel.

1,"11/30/2021, 07:27:09",ZIM = gamma squeeze candidate?,Theta-Maximus,"Calling all gamma squeezing apes. I'm interested in your thoughts on whether there's a potential gamma squeeze potential in $ZIM.

Background - $ZIM is a small/medium size container shipper that came public earlier this year after a reorganization. They lucked right into a shipping rate ramp and are running a bigger printing press than Jay Powell. They are raking in  $1/shr per week. Stock trades at a p/e of 1. Closed at  $57.62 today. Dividend of $2.50 to shareholders of record on Dec 16, the day before expiration. Then another dividend coming in late Jan. for  $10. Then another likely $2.50-$3.00 in Apr. They've got $30/shr in cash on the balance sheet, no debt, with $30/shr in lease obligations (they lease their container ships on 10-12 yr deals -- asset light biz model). Short interest built up thinking freight rates would peak early this fall and then the cycle would head down. But it's clear the supply chain mess isn't going to abate any time soon, and the crazy high rates $ZIM gets to charge will continue deep into 2022. There is NO NEW CAPACITY coming to market until mid-2023. Shorts are staring at having to pay min. $15 in dividends, plus borrow fees if they want to hold and hope for rates to peak and roll over.

1,"11/30/2021, 06:58:53",$ZIM = Gamma Squeeze candidate?,Theta-Maximus,"Calling all gamma squeezing apes. I'm interested in your thoughts on whether there's a potential gamma squeeze potential in $ZIM.

Background - $ZIM is a small/medium size container shipper that came public earlier this year after a reorganization. They lucked right into a shipping rate ramp and are running a bigger printing press than Jay Powell. They are raking in  $1/shr per week. Stock trades at a p/e of 1. Closed at  $57.62 today. Dividend of $2.50 to shareholders of record on Dec 16, the day before expiration. Then another dividend coming in late Jan. for  $10. Then another likely $2.50-$3.00 in Apr. They've got $30/shr in cash on the balance sheet, no debt, with $30/shr in lease obligations (they lease their container ships on 10-12 yr deals -- asset light biz model). Short interest built up thinking freight rates would peak early this fall and then the cycle would head down. But it's clear the supply chain mess isn't going to abate any time soon, and the crazy high rates $ZIM gets to charge will continue deep into 2022. There is NO NEW CAPACITY coming to market until mid-2023. Shorts are staring at having to pay min. $15 in dividends, plus borrow fees if they want to hold and hope for rates to peak and roll over. Just had a huge beat-and-raise Q. They made $12+/shr last Q, and guided higher for this Q (likely $12-$15shr).

As for the options, they're not getting flipped. Open interest is piling up. Put/call ratio today = 0.1. Put/call ratio on OI = 0.3. Huge skew to the call side.

Dear BadInDC,

A lot has happened this year thanks to the generous support you and other WallStreetBets members have given our organization. As promised, we have put your donations to great use, and I want to share an update with you from a recent trip to Rwanda on how you have helped us expand our work to protect gorillas 365 days a year.

In addition to the financial support you so generously gave, the international recognition we received as a result of the WallStreetBets initiative helped share our mission with a much wider audience. This is such an important part of conservation work - getting the message out to the broader public. And so, we were thrilled to be on 60 Minutes last night and wanted to make sureyou had a link to see more about what your support is enabling us to achieve. I hope you were able to tune in, but if not, youll find a link to the show [here](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rwanda-mountain-gorillas-60-minutes-2021-11-28/).

Thank you again for your continued financial and emotional investment in our cause. Your support has allowed us to continue our critical work of saving gorillas and their habitat and uplifting the local communities who share their forest home, and we are so very grateful.

We arrived to find yet another gorgeous/cutting-edge store renovation, complete with a mirrored ceiling that reminded me of the one I installed in our bedroom so the two of them could watch themselves make love.

While they frolicked and danced, I took a short walk over to where the old Apple store was located to see what they'd done with the old storefront.

Of course I found none other than a massive FISKER Advert, teasing the Ocean's arrival in 2022.

Because I'm a moron and fundamentals, shmundamentals, I loaded up on calls this morning. 

Fisker's connection to Apple manufacturer Foxconn is old news, but this just felt too coincidental.

Never put any effort into it either, just bought blue chip stocks. In the past year I got into that investment that everyone is on nowadays(cant type the name) and have done pretty well for myself. Obviously it's extremely volatile and I'm looking for something a little bit safer. I figure I'm better off making consistent money everyday rather than waiting for my assests to moon lol Long story short, I have about 50,000 that I'm willing to play around with. I'm looking to make about 500-1,000 profit everyday. 1,000 would be my target but I'd obviously be ok with 500 minimum. It's only a 1-2% daily ROI that I'm trying to achieve so I'm assuming it won't be that difficult. Of course I know some days I'll lose and some days I'll probably smash my target. I'm just wondering what is the safest and most reliable way to make 1-2% profit daily?

Which app/website/software do I use? I'm mainly looking to invest in US Markets, but there are chances that a EU one would be nice... I'm based in Greece, if that matters, but I don't have plans to trade any Greek Stocks. Is there any broker (?) that I can trade both Crypt and regular Stocks in? That'd be nice!

In general, I'm looking for answers based on which services **YOU**, real traders, use. I don't really want to waste my time reading Advertised articles on the ""best trading app"", etc. etc. I have seen many ads for the best trading services like eToro *(which, not gonna lie, impressed my with it's ""feautures"" and the ""copy another trader's moves"" thingy, but I think it has ultra super tax?

We are a NFT Game where you are going to have to do battles against other players using your cards!,Sad-Paramedic4234,"Welcome to Fantasy Arena! We are a top trending NFT game on PlayToEarn for the last few weeks! 
 
We are a NFT Game where you are going to have to do battles against other players using your cards with the best strategy to win. These past weeks, the community was able to test the Pre-Alpha version of the game with very good results. The community is really excited and happy with our development and are looking forward to the release of the official Alpha version! 
 
First the game will be released directly on the board, but we are working on the development of a Fantasy Arena METAVERSE, where there will be an open FANTASY world with villages, special zones, marketplace, Arena, etc. and you will be able to interact with other characters from all over the world, and you will be able to do card battles when you meet an opponent in the Metaverse. You will also be able to capture hidden NFTs or fight for them, as well as a game mode for betting Tokens that will fill the battles with excitement! 
 
In order to fight in the battles, it will be necessary to own NFT cards, NFTs will be released by Editions and Seasons. The idea of Fantasy Arena is that each edition will be about characters from different games, comics and movies. 
 
The name FANTASY ARENA means: 
 
 FANTASY: imagination, no limits, that's why in our game you will be able to see your favorite characters from comics and other games! 
 
 ARENA: Fight. I think, we, the real gamers always wonder how a fight between Wolverine and Spider-man would look like. Or Son Goku vs Hulk. 
 
EDITION 1 is based on a collaboration with Vain Glory! A very limited edition with each NFT numbered. There are still some NFTs available in our Marketplace. 
 
We come to revolutionize the P2E industry with a new system of sustainability and interaction. We have a team of expert developers in the industry and an unmatched strategy, you can read more about our SSS system in our Whitepaper. 
 
We are a very transparent team and we want maximum security for our community. We have seen that 99% of NFT games launch their token before doing practically anything, looking for project funding based on the sale of the token, we believe that this is a big mistake because it does not give sustainability and security to the project, everything is based on the sale of those tokens. We do not depend on funding based on the sale of tokens and we prefer to develop the game and that the community can test it first in a Pre-Alpha version so they can see the commitment of the team and know that they are investing in a real project. 
 
The community has been able to test the game and be happy with the results, we will proceed to open the Whitelist for a small private-sell where we will guarantee access to the owners of NFT, as a thank you for the support and belief in us from the first moment, plus other places of access for other members of the community who do not yet have any NFT. 
 Once everything is done and the token is released, we will open access to a Staking plan: Staking with NFT and Staking with Token. 
 
For more information we are waiting for you with open arms in our community!

Can someone please explain?,DefundTheKarens,"I understand why they dropped from $60 and that they have been in government conservatorship since the start of the housing-fueled financial crisis in 2008, but it seems no matter what the market, inflation, interest rates, catalysts, or anything else does, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just never seem to really move, especially up. I just can't seem to figure this one out. Any ideas what causes them to go up?  I've read that they normally mirror the 10 year Treasury note, but that hasn't been the case. There was one point after they dipped into the .60-.70 range that they revived back to the .90 range and haven't moved significantly since. I can't really be sure what made them move during the one jump they did have and I'd love to hear your thoughts on why good ole Fannie and Freddie are just sitting around and not climbing anymore. I would appreciate any thoughts or ideas you may have. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r55ekg/wth_fannie_freddie_move_already_can_someone/

1,"11/30/2021, 04:47:27","If you would like to make a risky play and have exposure to the booming EV market, but every company seems to have either an insane market cap or a high chance of being a scam, then Canoo (GOEV) might be for you.",prettyboyv,"The EV industry stock's performance nowadays, shows a lot of similarities to the dot-com bubble. Everyone and their mum knows that the future is coming fast and wants a piece of the pie, but that leads to almost every publicly traded company having a crazy valuation, even fraudulent ones( I am looking at you, NKLA) . Some might argue that the insanity is even bigger, cuz the automotive industry is famous for its competitiveness and low margins. However, no one knows how long the bubble will last, especially given the fact that the adoption of EV vehicles is growing rapidly and if you have a higher risk tolerance there is still time to make a bunch of money.  My personal favourite is Canoo, a company that despite all of the hype in the space, might still be a bit undervalued if it manages to deliver and has limitless upward potential if its competitors continue to trade at such  high valuations and the EV sector continues to be the ""hot chick"" of the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

Canoo is a young company that was founded by former Faraday and BMW employees. They both have left the company and one of them is now supposedly being in charge of the development of the Apple car.  The current CEO is Tony Aquilla, a serial enterpreneur. Aquilla has founded and sold numerous companies and all of them were directly connected  to the automotive industry.  In short, he mostly managed companies that sold workflow software for the vehicle's collision and insurance industries, but he also used to import automotive refinishing products. Also, unlike other executives of EV companies who ""cashed out"" at IPO, he recently bought 35.3 million shares of GOEV ( at a discounted price) and he plans to buy an additional 18.3 million, having a significant part of his network tied to the company. Well, this guy definitely inspires trust. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, the CEO is good, any other reason to buy Canoo?  I think that there are many. First of all, Canoo is not just another EV company that has its exterior design as the possible main competitive advantage. They actually want to revolutionise the way that EV cars are made. The basic shape of a car hasnt really changed over a century, with space for an engine, space for passengers, and space for luggage, all arranged in basically the same configuration. But because powerful electric motors and batteries are smaller than a standard powertrain, the whole shape of the vehicle could transform, if car designers were feeling creative. Canoo designed what it calls a skateboard, a thin platform that holds the battery cells, powertrain, and suspension, leaving more room for passengers with less footprint. Furthermore, they would use their ""skateboard"" as the de facto chasis for all of their models and that means faster production with less production costs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are they gonna really make a vehicle, or what you are saying has not gotten past a powerpoint presentation? Yes, they will as soon as the end of 2022. The company plans to build  a 400-acre campus including a full commercialization facility with a workshop, general assembly plant and another low-volume industrialization facility in Oklahoma. Canoo expects the plant to employ approximately 2000 people. Furthermore, the state has commited 300 million in financial iniatives for them. They are also planning to build a research facility in Arkansas and moved their headquarters there( of course, they have made a deal with the state that guarantees them more financial iniatives) . All in all, their mission is to transform  the U.S. Route 412 corridor from Oklahoma through Arkansas into a center of electric vehicle research, development and manufacturing power. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, let's take a look at their financials. Canoo as expected is a loss-generating company as they have zero revenue. However, their ""current ratio"" is over 3, which means that there is an extremely low chance for them to have liquidity problems at least in the near term. They also have preorders that are worth 303 million and expect at least 100 million from universities and institutions in the states that they are operating in. They also upped their sales estimates and now expect to sell 30000 units in 2023.

Can I make a lot of money from investing in Canoo in a short amount of time?  I never invest in companies for this reason, but nearly 40 percent of Canoo's float is shorted and if the shorts start to cover, the share price might get ""artificially"" inflated fast. There are also some near term catalysts like potential Apple and Walmart partnerships, but I won't dive deep into them, cuz they are pure speculation. There are a lot of DD' s on reddit about this topic, if you want to know more. Last but not least, Cannoo's current market cap is way lower than some of its competitors, which also have zero revenue. It is nearly 40 x lower than Lucid's and Rivian's , 2x lower than Fisker's, and 1.2x lower than Nikola's. My personal opinion is that Canoo's downside is lower compared to most of its competitors and the upside is bigger ( I know how cliche that sounds). However, I won't suggest investing in GOEV stock if you do not have a rather high risk tolerance, because you are still investing with a company that is at the early stage of its development, has zero revenue and market cap in the billions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r559e3/if_you_would_like_to_make_a_risky_play_and_have/

So I'm assuming here that options with a delta of 0.5 (so whose strike price equals the market price of the stock) have the biggest leverage in their extrinsic value for small price changes of the stock. What I was thinking was buying calls/puts of a really speculative company with an expiry date that's due for 1-3 months (to minimize time decay). For the best chances of making money, I'd buy the option when the stock price is close to the monthly low/high because that's when it's easier to predict the behaviour of the stock for the next day. 

Example: AMD's share price just reached a 52-week high of $161, so I'd be expecting it to go down by 1-2% for tomorrow considering how much it increased in price today. In consequence, I'd buy puts at $160 with an expiry date that's in January/February/March. Tomorrow, I would sell my puts if there's a 1-2% decrease in the share price to get a more-than-acceptable gain of 10-20%. If the stock still goes up, I'd hold until the time decay of my stock starts being high enough to start eating away the extrinsic value of my puts.

The company IMHO is so undervalued at this price and has much room to go up, HIMX had strong revenue and earnings growth in the last 4 quarters, but the stock price did not act accordingly, and I believe this growth will continue due to chip shortage, and the transformation in the global economy to electric cars, in 2030 most of the big cars brands are expected to stop producing diesel cars and produce only electric cars, this is regardless the already existed electric cars brands like Xpeng, Nio, Tesla etc. this will cause constant demand on chips and more production and revenue for HIMX and other semiconductor stocks.

[HIMX Revenue and Earnings over the last 4 quarters](https://preview.redd.it/266c441bsk281.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f55df388f212268f29cb965c51b012c1fcacff88)

  

Below a comparison between AMD and HIMX performance for the last 4 quarters:

HIMX Revenue growth AMD Revenue growth

Q4 2020 $276M **QoQ +15%** Q4 2020 $3.24B **QoQ +15%**

Q1 2021 $309M **QoQ +12%** Q1 2021 $3.45B **QoQ +7%**

Q2 2021 $365M **QoQ +18%** Q2 2021 $3.85B **QoQ +12%**

Q3 2021 $421M **QoQ +15%** Q3 2021 $4.31B **QoQ +12%**

  

HIMX                    AMD

Price to Earnings               5.35                      49.23

Price to Sales                     1.29                      12.76

Book value per share       $4.17!!             $5.89!! 

Current ratio                      2.01                       2.24

AMD is definitely bigger name than HIMX but I used this comparison just to show how HIMX is growing on the same pace as AMD, how it has healthy statistics, and how cheap its valuation.

**Summary:**

IMO HIMX is a solid play and a bargain at this price, the only thing that is holding back the stock price is the possible conflict between China and Taiwan, but if that happens, all the market will tank.

My conservative prediction is that One year from now assuming normal market conditions HIMX price will be at least $20.

Also 15% short interest add some spice to the stock.

And my last word is, see you on the moon

&amp;#x200B;

I think Matterport is going to be huge in the coming months and here's why: 

&amp;#x200B;

	1) To reach as many people as possible, every e-commerce company wants to distribute their fulfillment network as much as possible. The downside of this distribution is that the engineering and construction teams must travel to get accurate site measurements (as-designed - NEVER - matches the as-built... or the building just doesn't have blueprints/CAD available). This type of situation makes Matterport an indispensable tool; reducing engineer travel and speeding up the whole design process. Matterport has a network of contractors with their 3D scanning equipment across the country, and can easily get an accurate 3D and 2D model of the site built. As more e-commerce startups happen, and formerly closed business spaces begin to re-open, Matterport will be the go-to for accurate space information.

&amp;#x200B;

	2. Facebook already has a contract with Matterport for AI research. As Meta continues to grow and tries to get ""digitized"" workplaces, I'm sure Matterport will be the company scanning every corporate facility for ingestion.  Apple, Google, Microsoft, and many others are also trying to compete with Meta in the digital workspace realm, and they will also need 3D scans of workplaces, so this will be ripe for opportunity. The possibilities here are limitless.

&amp;#x200B;

	3. I've been keeping an eye on the housing market, and I would estimate that around 30% of houses I'm seeing have an accompanying Matterport. As foreclosures start to happen and the technology continues to gain popularity, this will only drive more adoption.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r50roh/matterport_mttr_is_on_the_rise/

I was blown away I almost forgot, but with the variant news, economy almost collapsing in the two biggest countries, personal debt, and a furious drug problem who can blame me? So I did what any retard with only a half functioning brain cell would do in this situation, and I checked the trending google searches. 

The ONLY trending google search related to cyber Monday (granted they change by the fuckin nano second) was SPECIFICALLY related to kitchen aid mixers. 

Another 7 seconds of googling revealed that kitchen aid is owned entirely by whirlpool, who also owns many other appliances that people are frantically ordering this very second. 

This 5 minutes of googling in total is practically free money. Take it or leave it.

What your take on the spy? We going back to ATH or is this new variant going to put doubt back into the market.  Everything I read said this variant is just more contagious but nothing deadly. Not sure why the market too a 1000 point dip Friday.  Not justified.

1,"11/21/2021, 23:51:15","Guys! I think I found a no-risk, easy money strategy on Robinhood.",dougball69,"This might sound dumb af, but its so stupid it might actually work. Heres my outline of the idea:

1) Get a Robinhood account with margin, preferably with a huge portfolio so you can be leveraged out the ass

2) Throw all of your money into Robinhood FDs, right before an earnings call.

3) Robinhood should (keyword: should) notice such an inbred play, that it should result in some concern.

4) Now, this can go one of two routes if they notice:

     A) They plan on having a blowout                     earnings report, and will let the position(s) go through

     B) They have another shitty quarter, and realize that your position in their company is absolute trash and will get completely obliterated. Now, this is the most likely outcome! They will be forced to close out your position; cause they know damn well the pizza boy living in his moms basement cant afford such a massive loss.

     C) If all hell breaks loose and you get fucked over; you could argue in court that there should have been a lot more risk management. After incidents like GUHH! and the legendary Box Spread, it shouldve been obvious! Or you can just delete the app, that seems to work too.

Good luck with this infinite money hack! Highly recommend doing it every quarter.

I have been all over Twitter and other apps asking for others to help me out and have had a VERY tough time. I know everyone has their own lives and are busy etc, Im not asking for the world here lol. More over looking for someone to guide me and maybe just direct me on where to even start , what to research, who to research. How do I come up with my own strategy? How do I learn how to disseminate the numbers of a stock to learn and judge the fundamentals of a company, what is YOUR process and why? Thats really what Im looking for someone to maybe take an hour or two a week, not to teach even, but to guide me in right direction. I WANT TO LEARN!!!

I don't do outright trading advice; this is intended to help form a picture, possibilities, ideas, to keep in mind when making trades.

I take a look at the overall market through some charts first, then use those to highlight some possible conclusions and considerations.

Let's dig in.

# Charts

[Sector Compare YTD](https://www.tradingview.com/x/x4YHO2WX/)  
There's a lot going on here, but really we're just looking at the year-to-date % moves across our top indices and sector ETFs, to get an idea of what's been leading and what's been lagging.

[SPY 1y](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aYpjCCVU/)

[QQQ 1y](https://www.tradingview.com/x/epMPugQp/)

[IWM 1y](https://www.tradingview.com/x/n9R1TbHe/)

So just looking at these:

* After exploding higher from the mid-October lows, SPY has been flirting with the 470 (SPX 4700) level for almost two weeks.
* Likewise, the QQQ was flirting with the 400 level (NDX 16400) for the same time period, but broke higher Thursday/Friday as bond yields fell. Generally when we've seen the Qs break above a level like this, we see more runway and more ATHs.
* IWM (small caps) broke out of the range they've been in for the majority of the year, but have given up these gains and closed down inside that range on Friday. Right now this is looking like a failed breakout, and we'll have to see what the price action gives us next week.Perhaps this could have been opex-related (we'll discuss more below), and anecdotally small caps have outperformed more often than not in November / EOY, but the last two weeks have been worrying.

Let's take a look at some other charts to help build more context:

[SPY vs S5fI](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LYAnsTqd/)  
SF5I is an index that tracks/measure the percentage of S&amp;P500 stocks above their 50-day moving average. This gives us some insight into *breadth* \- the amount of stocks that are actually performing well within the index. The higher the better, as that's indicative of more stocks participating in the rally.

[NDX vs NDFI](https://www.tradingview.com/x/t8ctpiNB/)  
This is a likewise chart showing  the Nasdaq 100 vs the Nasdaq 100 stocks above their 50-day moving average.

[IWM vs R2FI](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GljXtOIv/)  
Likewise chart for the Russell.

[RSP](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Rtn6XBQ2/)  
This is the equal-weight S&amp;P500 (SPY is cap-weighted), which gives us similar insight: if this is going down and SPY is going up, that's indicative of small breadth, just a few high-weighted stocks leading SPY higher instead of a broader-based rally.

[US10Y](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2AfL6hFe/)  
The 10y has been pretty volatile as of late, eliciting some nervousness as it swung up to 1.7 but then giving pretty much all of that back. I'm not worried about this until we see it break above that 1.70 - 1.75 zone, which I think would cause a sell off in growth stocks. Until then though, no reason to worry IMO.

[DXY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/euklkjzN/)  
A lot of people have been looking at the strength in the dollar (index). I want to take a moment to remind everyone that the DXY is a measure of the dollar vs a basket of 7 other currencies, but the largest one being the EUR. IMO the recent move higher in the DXY is not so much dollar strength relative to other currencies, but instead the EUR dropping hard, and we can see that in this chart: [EUR/USD vs DXY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gFVWMfXe/) \- this entire move has been from the euro falling against the dollar, and that's really more about the state of Europe and European monetary policy than dollar strength.

# Looking forward &amp; Takeaways

[Gamma Exposure](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?), a measure of the total gamma exposure in the market, hit highs going into opex last week but we saw a majority of that roll off on Friday's expiration. High gamma usually portends price *pinning* and possibly volatile price action out of opex. It will be interesting to see next week if we get a volatile move higher or lower, as one of the other is likely coming out of a opex like this.

&amp;#x200B;

* As just mentioned, gamma rolling off generally portends some volatility in one direction or another and thinking about seasonality here our assumption would be a move higher.
* We need to watch small caps (IWM / Russell). Is this a failed breakout, or will we bounce back and push higher? I already have a position here and will cut losses if we continue to break down; alternatively I'll look to add if we start to see positive price action again.
* Likewise, though I didn't include their charts, oil / energy and financials are in the same situation. This makes sense as they exploded higher will small caps from the end of last year into early this year, but they're now looking at a possible failed breakout like IWM / /RTY. All of these are sitting right at what could be a support level, so will be watching if these are able to bounce back and resume an uptrend - where I'll be a buyer - or if they'll confirm a breakdown.
* I think you still have to have some long exposure to growth / tech. It's looking likely we continue higher here, and the narrative has been growth / tech as the market leaders doesn't look likely to change right now.
* Seasonality is in play here, and barring any unknown unknowns, I think we are higher by EOY / January, and I'm likely to buy any weakness into the start of December. We should be constantly reviewing market conditions though, and re-adjusting our own positions to accommodate. Flows before pros, always.

I've constantly thought back to [this note](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sp500-forecast-yearend-big-first-half-returns-2021-7) from earlier this summer:

&gt;When its advance is greater than 12.5% in the first six months of a year, the S&amp;P 500 usually records a median return of 9.7%, which is nearly twice the median return of 5% for any given year, according to LPL Financial.

Like most youths want to be driving what their favorite basketball player or musician is driving I dont think youll be hearing rappers singing about driving their Lucid down boulevard with two baddies in the back. 

And I dont think major celebrities will be getting behind this vehicle since its doesnt have much a status symbol like a BMW, Mercedes, porche, etc. does 

And if youre a playboy, you would much prefer a lambo or a Ferrari 

And if youre in the ultra rich category that absolute loves a well finished vehicle, you would buy a rolls Royce 

And if youre in the lower class, you wont be able to afford the 100k price tag on the lucid, so youre opting for a Toyota or a Honda 

And if youre in the middle class / working class, youll probably still on a budget thats under 100k. So youll be looking for something that is more functional for work and family, like a truck or an SUV

If youre a EV enthusiast / purist straight to the core, youll go for a Tesla

And if youre a foreigner, like Chinese or Korean, youll gravitate naturally towards a bmw, Mercedes, or a Tesla (I know because Im Asian). 

So with all that said, the only crowd that I can think of is old people. Old people who are disconnected with trends and disconnected with social statuses, who doesnt care about all the things mentioned above. Old people, who are already retired and have 100k. 

Sure they won motor cars of the year, but do you know who won the last two years? It was Kia, and you dont see people screaming and celebrating that fact. And frankly, I still dont see many kias on the road. 

Its funny that they have a model called the dream, but I dont think this is anyones dream car

1,"11/21/2021, 22:00:17",Why FUBO will 10-15X shortly.,Grouchy_Raccoon_6759,"Bullish case for FUBO

    FUBO has a low market cap of around 3B today.  I expect it to do more revenue it 2023 than that low 3B alone, and growth will continue to be high and drive it much further in the future. 
     After being in a relatively steady zone, FUBO stock  looked poised to break out just before earnings, but sold off and fell 40% after a tremendous earnings report.   We know short interest has remained high at around 20% of the float, and the stock price has certainly fluctuated in this manner before.  However, this is the a rare chance to pick up a stock that will eventually 10-15X in a short period of time.  
     For starters, their growth rate is insane.  The number of customer acquisitions are growing so fast estimates have risen 4 times this year.  They now have about 1.1 million customers.  To put that in perspective, they had roughly 300,000 users going into Q3 of last year.  Thats over a 300% growth looking at that short time period.  This high growth rate resulted in revenue growing 156% YoY. Keep in mind that there are still almost 80 million households with traditional cable.  It is estimated that 50 million of them will cut of cable for an alternate TV package in the next five years.  Over the last 18 months, FUBO has increased its market share In acquiring these customers faster than any competitor, including Sling and YouTubeTV.  Conservatively, FUBO will get 20% of these 50 million customers as they are already hitting that marker.  This would be a growth of over 1000% from Oct 2021 to 2026  But that 20% is low in my opinion, and they will most likely continue to increase their pie in this category, and could easily get 33% of future cord cutters. This alone would add around 15 million net users in the next 5 years.  Another thing that separates FUBO from traditional cable is availability.  With traditional cable, you have to live in an area with a cable service, and some people that live in rural or undeveloped  areas will not have access to a Comcast or Verizon choice but would be able to get FUBO.  As FUBO continues to become a recognized name, it will take market share from satellite companies that have a worse service.  Additionally, FUBO is a superior service to people who move or travel a lot, as they always immediately have access to the full service and can watch FUBO on any streaming device without needing Cable Boxes, a satellite, or being at their installed location to get a TV service like Cox or Comcast.  This would add to more customers not in the cable cutter area, and at a minimum, expect another 1 million subscribers here.

Not only are the customers growing for FUBO, but the QUALITY of one user is much more meaningful for FUBO than when compared to Netflix, Disney, DraftKings, etc.  The average revenue per user for stand alone streaming services is small, normally between $10-14.  For FUBO, it was $69 last quarter, or about 500% higher and is growing at a higher rate than that of its peers.  The number of hours people watch FUBO is higher than any streaming service that exists, giving it the opportunity to generate more advertising revenue than its competitors.  The reason its higher is because it focuses on live sports, which captures the users attention for a few hours at a time rather than traditional television shows.   

FUBO is getting into creating their own content centered around sports analysis and discussion. I expect that as their sports betting service takes off, more original content will be developed for this as well.  With sports betting, FUBO has one huge advantage that hasnt really been discussed.  Sports betting has an extremely high customer acquisition cost, which is why you see all of the advertising of TV and everywhere else.  DG estimated it to be around $800.  For FUBO, their customer acquisition costs is much closer to $0 than $800, as the customers they are attracting are already paying subscribers.  
The technology FUBO uses for its service is light years ahead of its peers.  For those who havent seen its ability to connect with your smart phone, its a  really feature and allows your phone to be more engaged with your TV than just acting like a remote as it can give live betting options and stats and syncs with your TV to change as you change the game.  Another nice feature is Fanview, which gives the user to see sports stats while they are watching the game. They also offer several games for free in 4K quality, something its competitors do not.  These great sports features will help it capture sports betting market share.  I expect it to capture a portion of the sports betting frenzy, which will add revenue to its bottom line in the hundreds of millions.

People discuss the high short interest, which is about the same as AMC but this stock doesnt need a short squeeze to get the price up.  The short squeeze potential is here and real, but not needed to be a good investment.  It will be successful either way, although the shorts need to burn here as well as they have been playing with fire on this one for far too long.   The CEO said it himself, the proof of concept is complete, and FUBO isnt going away any time soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyvjum/why_fubo_will_1015x_shortly/

Multilevel marketing on blockchain!!!

 It means security for investors where everything happens automatically without having someone holding your money. When you want you can withdraw your money. 

Your token automatically drops into your wallet. You get 50% of your referral paid to join, and you still get 5% of everyone who falls under you up to 10th level. So, if you nominate you win but if you don't nominate you also win!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyv6zw/smart_contract/

With the rise of Metaverse, i've tried to look at which companies might benefit from this new secular movement. there are obvious choices like $U and $NVDA. but i was looking at companies with smaller marketcap and flying under the radar where it can potentially have a big pop as this movement towards metaverse gets bigger.

The company name is Immersion Corporation. They are the developer and licensor for haptic technology. So things like 3D touch with apple, Dual sense joystick for PS5, are all using patents from IMMR. As they're a tech company creating patents, and other companies can/should pay for for its patent use. Previously, they sued several companies like Apple and Microsoft and won. My thesis is that alot of hardware vendors (Facebook Oculus, 3rd party AR/VR providers, Apple) might guarantee a future revenue stream for IMMR as the metaverse explodes.

The company marketcap is around 200 Million USD and has small short interest of around 3.4%. They probably had management issues as it can be seen from insider's selling and CEO resigning (maybe due to bad management as they could potentially more from companies that use their tech, they have more than 3200 patents).

Technically, the stock needs to above 12, and then 15 to see an aggressive move to the upside of around 22.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, they are in an ETF named Meta, where the stock is next big giants, like Apple, NVDA, Microsoft, Facebook ,etc. so any buying into this META etf will do them well in my opinion.

I own 350 contracts for IMMR expiring in may 2022 with a strike of 12.5

Now, I recently bought a new phone and surprisingly, it was 30% of the usual price. I figured, how can there be such a steep discount if shortages were everywhere. So I googled and found out that even those fancy GPUs gamers and miners fight over weren't that rare online.

Somehow, it's seems like the car makers are the main ones suffering. Which is kinda sus.

A car goes easily into the 5-6 digit range while flagship phones top at 2k. You would think that car makers would be able to afford much higher prices than phone makers to bid for that capacity.

""But car makers have shitty margins.""

Guess which car maker doesn't have shitty margins?

Papa Musk's very own Tesla. They have the ability to jack up their bids on those crucial chips to the point where they are the only ones who can still make cars profitably.

Or it could be China. A few billions to buy out the chip supply and force overseas car makers to give up market shares.

&gt;!About BioRestorative Therapies, Inc.!&lt;

BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ([www.biorestorative.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=G48NSWPkqD7gz0u-ebI2FYhb6wUgyzK9uJKtKuKhBmxTeXfR_EMNKom_6SGqDjoQk-P1KqzSaWdopkmHPRPveSa0XJMwWVDxBG9QpHa6fVI=)) develops therapeutic products using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells. Our two core programs, as described below, relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders:

 Disc/Spine Program (brtxDISC): Our lead cell therapy candidate, *BRTX-100,* is a product formulated from autologous (or a persons own) cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patients bone marrow. We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of painful lumbosacral disc disorders or as a complementary therapeutic to a surgical procedure. The *BRTX-100* production process utilizes proprietary technology and involves collecting a patients bone marrow, isolating and culturing stem cells from the bone marrow and cryopreserving the cells. In an outpatient procedure, *BRTX-100* is to be injected by a physician into the patients damaged disc. The treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of surgery. We have received authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial using *BRTX-100* to treat chronic lower back pain arising from degenerative disc disease.

 Metabolic Program (ThermoStem): We are developing a cell-based therapy candidate to target obesity and metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic homeostasis in humans. Initial preclinical research indicates that increased amounts of brown fat in animals may be responsible for additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid levels. Researchers have found that people with higher levels of brown fat may have a reduced risk for obesity and diabetes.

BRTX has numerous patents around the world.

1,"11/21/2021, 14:14:56",Tesla Stock Split Conspiracy Theory,big663,"I dont normally do threads like this, but Im a big supporter of Elon Musk and I follow [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) stock closely. This is going to be a nerdy, conspiracy-theory type thread on Tesla, based on some recent hints from Elon himself.  Take it for what you will; I just think it's fun.

Truth or fiction, its still interesting to analyze, and I did happen to stumble upon a connection that seems beyond coincidence -- something which to my knowledge no one else has picked up on.  That made it worth writing about.  Well save that bit for last.

So, Elon is known for leaving breadcrumbs, which are usually only evident in retrospect.   A great example is this now-famous tweet:   Youll notice that his tweet was sent at 8:11 PST; a stock split was then announced on August 11th (8/11).  


[stock price too high tweet](https://preview.redd.it/tdggb6cq3w081.png?width=2250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91f12606102b88ef1495cb70463a3dda77a68ba9)

here are more examples, but this thread deals with the current speculation over another upcoming [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) split.  Why the speculation?   Well, Teslas price is nearing the same levels as when the previous split was announced; that alone is enough to fuel some healthy speculation.

More interestingly, Elon seems to have been dropping some of his famous hints here and there about when the split might occur.  This hypothetical date is 12/09/21, and some speculators think it will be a 5:1 split, as was the previous split.

Now, most of this speculation is tongue-in-cheek. Just us [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) fans having fun more or less.   Consider this, for example: ""129 orbital flights"" -- an oddly specific milestone -- which some believe hints at the 12/9 date.  Eh. Not super convincing.  


[falcon 9 milestone tweet](https://preview.redd.it/yn03ahoz3w081.png?width=1468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01668e9ccad3c8c7885620aa2f8fb3d9df615f03)

Or [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1460982932642877451), from [@garyblack00](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00). ""12 million pounds of thrust."" Gary noted that there are 9 middle thrusters.   Again, 12/9 appears. And Elon Musk's tweet was sent at 10:20 PST. 10:2, reducible to 5:1. Nothing too firm; maybe just fueling the fire a little.  


[gary black noting the raptor engines](https://preview.redd.it/dmha5poe4w081.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=765a579c0421c4d5e651c4b92ac0609ad5497783)

coincidences? Maybe. But this is where it's gonna start to get weird.  [@garyblack00](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00) noticed an oddity in his excellent  research and analysis.  


[gary analysing stock sale](https://preview.redd.it/mlktpyyn4w081.png?width=1484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f8d9aba1567ffcc82efd85d431575ac85521147)

Of all the random blocks of stock Elon has been selling in various amounts, one very specific number has appeared 3 times (so far): 934,091 shares.  At first glance, nothing seems too special about this number. But, knowing Elon, it just seems too specific to be random.

It took me about 5 minutes before I saw it, and I cannot possibly imagine how all this is a coincidence.   (I also cannot imagine how he reverse engineered this, so there's that too.)  Anyway, here we go. Nerd stuff only from here on out. You've been warned

We've established that Elon has been (somewhat)  planting the 12/9 number in our heads, leading many to speculate on a 12/09/21 split.  Then this 934,091 number starts appearing. Could they be connected?  What follows is complete lunacy, but it's too perfect not to lay it out.

12/09/2021 can be written as the number 12,092,021.   Lets divide that by his ""random"" recurring sale number, 934,091. The result?   12.9  Sound familiar?

But an iPhone calculator gives 6 decimal places by default, so the full number you see is 12.945228.  We've already got 12.9. But what happens if we add up the remaining decimals?  4+5+2+2+8 = (drumroll) 21.  12.9.211231710

Crazy? We've barely even started.  The iPhone shows 6 decimal places by default, but the full iPhone result is: 12.94522803452769.  What if we add \*all\* the numbers after the 12.9? This is tricky because we have a zero -- so are we adding 8 + 0, or 80?    Elon may have answered.

In a recent discussion about the concept of zero, Elon wrote ""Nothing matters"" -- ""nothing"" here referring to zero, in that it \*does\* matter -- i.e, include it in the number to get 80.   He then followed it up with this:

&amp;#x200B;

[elon's tweet on zero being a cool concept](https://preview.redd.it/99zj92pw4w081.png?width=1506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b002072ffab96874114baa209b524366d7a40e5c)

(It's worth noting that Elon's above tweet was sent at 11:34; I mention it because if you return to our full number -- 12.94522803452769 -- you'll notice a 34 immediately after the zero in question.)  Not convinced? Think I'm stretching? Read on.

Go ahead and grant me this zero matters"" thing and let's add up all the numbers in 12.94522803452769, after the 12.9.  4+5+2+2+80+3+4+5+2+7+6+9 = ?  129.

Believe it or not, we are still not done.   In true [@elonmusk](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk) fashion, he has personally signed this amazing work of art.  Let's add up all the single numbers in 12.94522803452769, just to see what we get.  1+2+9+4+5+2+2+8+0+3+4+5+2+7+6+9 = ?  69.

One obvious thing I left out that Id like to add here  I have no idea if this means a split is happening on 12/9.   Elon could just as easily be trolling; Im making no predictions here.  I just find it incredible that this much detail, planning, and genius went into this.

Specifically regarding buying calls, does the breakeven price only apply to those that plan on exercising the contract? 

For example, say xyz stock is currently trading at $50. I buy 1 call that expires 6 months from now for $70 with a breakeven of $75. Am I GUARANTEED that I will breakeven on what I paid for the CONTRACT as long as xyz stock reaches $75 before expiration? Assuming I DO NOT plan on exercising the contract and only plan on profiting from selling back the contract?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyng8x/breakeven_clarification/

I like the stock...and I did a test drive and review of the car. As well, I discuss the upcoming merger. As you may or may not know, it is a SPAC that is planned to go public sometime in the first half of 2022, no date yet confirmed. The company is seeking to compete in the EV market, and has a leg up on some of its competitors, in that it already has vehicles in production, and delivery of over 10,000 vehicles. The car itself isn't very fancy in terms of features, but it is pretty basic and offers what you would want from a very standard EV at this price point. I am concerned they may not be very popular, but it seems they are the talk of the EV town at the moment. What are your thoughts? Have ya'll given any thought to this company and its future potential?    
I attached some pics I took prior to test driving. (See below)

1,"11/21/2021, 12:15:28",Global Financial System,aeast571,"Hi all,

Just curious how the whole global currency market works. Let me know if this is the right or wrong thread. Basically what I was taught in business school is that the 8-10 major international banks (HSBC, Bank of America etc.) that trade in such high volumes that they dictate what the currency values ultimately end up being for the market. We were taught that these banks kept an eye on inflation, currency inflows and outflows (from big business transactions to immigration etc.), how much money the central banks were printing, interest rates etc. The way I see it though is that when these big banks do their currency transactions I don't see anything stopping them from just making the transaction for what gives them the most profit. So like yes, these big banks will monitor what these countries monetary policy is and what the inflows and outflows of currencies look like. But I'm saying that they aren't trying to accurately measure what the currency value should be, but rather making transactions amongst themselves for what will make their bank the most profit. Like if they see a need to hold more reserves of USD because they'll need it for an influx of USD loans they're about to give out, they'll then make a currency trade with another bank for that currency, that trade will then be factored in to what the other big banks are trading at then it gets averaged out. Am I wrong in how I'm looking at this?

Also wondering how all these Big bank currency trades get averaged. Is there a minimum amount of what would constitute as a major swing currency deal? Does a deal have to meet a certain threshold and then all those minimum threshold meeting deals get averaged and then that's your currency value?

Also, what are your thoughts on having a platform that averages every currency deal no matter how big or small. This then gives a completely accurate picture of the what the currencies are valued at. Like literally someone could trade 1USD for 2 Euros and then they would report it to this international platform. I just feel like this is needed because the big banks have a lot of power in dictating the currency value. I understand they would still be the swing power in deciding the currency values because of all their reserves but everybody's say could chip away at that.

There is only one bubble huge enough to bring down the whole global economy. AND IT IS NOT EVERGRAND.

IT'S THE EVs BUBBLE. It's TSLA, LCID, RIVIN, FSR, NIO etc. 

Tesla with over 1 trillion market cap is worth more than all car makers together not Toyota that sells multiple million cars very year. Rivian rallied to be the 3 biggest automotive manufacturer in the world bypassing volkswagen without any revenue. Volkswagen the owner of audi, Porsche, Bentley, Scania, man, Skoda, SEAT, VW etc.

Everyone is aware of global chip shortage and supply chain issues. EV needs 10x more chips than usual automotive. Elon musk selling billion of dollars in TSLA stock for nor reason and the stock is still over 1000$ per share.

The first thing that caught my eye was the extremely low PE at less than 4. I assumed that the companies growth must be non existent and/or they had a terrible debt/cash ratio. I was completely wrong. 

GTIMs revenue grew 40% this quarter to 34,000,000 dollars. Their net income grew 4500 percent (no, thats not a typo) this quarter to 13.6 million dollars. They have 10,000,000 in cash on hand and paid off all of their debt. 

The companies restaurants have great reviews at all 35 locations and are diversified in the types of restaurants they operate (some sit down, some drive thru).

I usually stick to value or GARP investing but I feel like this might be to great of a buy to ignore. The only negative I could find was the extremely low average volume (30,000).

1,"11/21/2021, 05:26:13",What Is Micron Technology (MU) and Why Is It Trending?,SavienKennedy,"Good morning fellow apes; Im here to tell you about Micron Technology and answer a few questions: what is it, why is it trending, and is there a future for it?

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT IS MU?**

**Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)** is an American producer of computer memory and computer data storage. This includes DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), flash memory, and USB flash drives. Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix. Micron and Intel together created IM Flash Technologies, which produces NAND flash memory.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY IS MU TRENDING ON** r/wallstreetbets**?**

Evercore Fundamental Research Analyst C.J. Muse boosted to his firms Top Picks list last week. He argues that MU could benefit from the green shoots hes seeing in the memory industry.

Even though MU lost 1.3% since the start of June (and competitor Lam has fallen 0.8%, while the Semiconductor index has increased 22.8% in the same time frame), Muse confidently states that ..it is clear that the tides are shifting, with pricing decline expectations into 1HCY22 becoming less bad, estimates likely bottoming in 1H22, and green shoots arising from PC constraints elsewhere easing, and hyperscale capex spend likely improving before year end. Thus, we think it is game on for memory.

From an investor positioning perspective, we note investors are generally eager to get back into memory for anticipated outperformance in 2022 but are not there today, Muse wrote. So when the turn comes, we think it will be fast and furious.

Apart from EverCore, there are other financial analysts who believe MU is poised to take advantage of the future of memory. Citi analyst Christopher Danely notes that the firm's DRAM analyst Peter Lee recently raised his DRAM pricing expectations for Q4 of 2021 and Q1 of 2022, driven mostly by upside from the PC end market, which led the DRAM correction. Channel checks indicate there has been some upside from the PC market for DRAM and demand from the server end market for Q1 of 2022 appears to be better than expected, Danely tells investors in a research note. As such, the analyst expects ""more positive catalysts"" for DRAM in the coming months and initiated a ""positive catalyst watch"" on Buy-rated Micron. He expects the stock to trade higher as investors gain more confidence the DRAM correction ""is drawing to a close."" Danely keeps a $120 price target on the stock, currently trading just north of $80 a share.  
 

After the two above reports became public, the market started to react. MU recently started trending as one of the top 3 most mentioned tickers on r/wallstreetbets, beating out PayPal, Tilray, Amazon, and Aurora.

**THE FUTURE OF MEMORY AND MU**

The memory-chip market hit the skids in the second half of 2018 when sales of smartphones, personal computers, servers and other gear slowed. But memory-chip sales rebounded in late 2020.

Boise, Idaho-based Micron makes two main types of memory chips: DRAM and Nand. Dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, accounted for 74% of Micron's revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter. Nand flash memory accounted for 24% of its revenue during the period.

DRAM chips act as the main memory in PCs, smartphones and other devices, working closely with central processing units. Nand flash provides longer-term data storage.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT IS DRAM?**

Normal RAM is a semiconductor that is placed on a processor that stores variables for calculations. RAM provides memory locations for requested data. The CPU receives a data read instruction with the datas memory address or location, and then it sends the address to the RAM controller.

The controller, in turn, sends the address to the proper pathway, opening path transistors and reading each capacitor value. The read data is transmitted back to the CPUs cache.

The speed of this read/write operation is important to know about. They are called timings: faster timings with less lag between them result in faster access times. Slower timings result in lower performance. Bandwidth also affect performance: the larger the bandwidth, the more data per second RAM can process and the faster the timings.

Basically, if you want the best SSD for your buck, you want to know if you are getting something with fast timings or slow timings.. namely, SRAM or DRAM.

   

* SRAM has lower access time, and is faster whereas DRAM has a higher access time and is slower compared to SRAM.
* SRAM users transistors and latches while DRAM uses capacitors and very few transistors.
* L2 and L3 CPU cache units are some general applications of a SRAM while the DRAM is mostly found as the main memory in computers.
* SRAM offers low packaging density while DRAM offers a high packaging density.
* SRAM is in the form of on-chip memory, but DRAM has the characteristics of off-chip memory.

In short, DRAM uses very few transistors, has the characteristics of off chip memory, and is available in larger storage capacity

&amp;#x200B;

**ADVANTAGES OF DRAM**

* Cheaper compared to SRAM.
* It has a higher storage capacity. Hence it is used to create a larger RAM space system.
* Offers simple structure.
* It doesnt require to refresh the memory contents.
* You dont need to refresh the memory contents and its access time is faster.
* Logic or circuitry is needed, so the memory module itself is simpler.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY**

Worldwide sales of semiconductors in Q3 2021 were $144.8 billion, an increase of 27.6% over Q3 2020 and 7.4% more than Q2 2021, reported by the Semiconductor Industry Association.

John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO says Semiconductor shipments reached all-time highs in the third quarter of 2021, demonstrating both the ongoing high global demand for chips and the industrys extraordinary efforts to ramp up production to meet that demand.

Global sales for the month of September 2021 were $48.3 billion, an increase of 27.6% over the total from September 2020 and 2.2% more than sales from August 2021.

Regionally, year-to-year sales increased in the Americas 33.5%, Europe 32.3%, Asia Pacific/All Other 27.2%, Japan 24.5%, and China 24.0%.

Month-to-month sales increased in the Americas 3.9%, Europe 2.0%, Japan 2.0%, Asia Pacific/All Other 1.9%, and China 1.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

**ANALYSIS OF MU  CUP AND HANDLE**

On Nov. 6, MU started to break out of a cup-with-handle according to IBD MarketSmith charts. A three-weeks-tight pattern in late December offered an add-on buy point at 74.71.

Micron stock has an **IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating** of B-, indicating modest institutional buying of MU stock.

&amp;#x200B;

[MU Cup and Handle](https://preview.redd.it/at41phf8ht081.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74012005729ab7a8ded8e662cc9ff1ce85970c17)

Micron wasn't directly affected by the chip shortage, since it manufactures its own chips instead of outsourcing them to third-party foundries. However, it expects shortages of other PC components -- including CPUs and GPUs -- to indirectly curb the market's near-term demand for its memory chips. That warning, along with a softer-than-expected forecast for the first quarter, spooked investors last month.

Despite these challenges, analysts still expect Micron's revenue and earnings to rise 15% and 44%, respectively, this year, as it benefits from the secular expansion of the gaming, data center, cloud, 5G, and automotive markets. Those catalysts might also spark a ""super cycle"" in memory chip upgrades, which could last much longer than previous cycles and propel Micron's stock to fresh highs.

1,"11/21/2021, 03:11:51",$FUBO will beat on Q4 earnings,mhlor,"Fubo is a tv streaming platform similar to that of YoutubeTV and HuluTV. They have recently taken a beating after its recent earnings run and subsequent drop. This was due to an EPS miss largely because of massive sales and marketing spending to speed up subscription growth. In addition to eps miss, small cap stocks have also been beaten down the past couple of weeks dropping FUBO to a price of $21.50 at Fridays close. The current price presents a tremondous opportunity for short term and long term gains.   


**CATALYSTS** 

Fubo announced they've hit the 1 million subscription milestone during Q3 ER. This is hinting at a huge revenue boost in this Q4 period. For reference, for most of Q3, Fubo sat at around 600k subs. Fubo's ARPU has been rising by about $2 per earnings with a projected $76 ARPU for this Q4. Given 1 millions subs x 3 months for q4, thats 3 million subs x ARPU of $76 giving roughly $230 million vs their guided $200 mil. 

Margins will improve per subscription due to ad revenue. Fubo currently produces $8.50 ad revenue per subscription. This ad revenue chews directly into the business expenses and negative margin. Imagine 400k more subscriptions per month in q4 vs q3. That is roughly a $8-$10 million in ad revenue gained. This will help margins immensely. Take a look at my chart below to see how an increase in subscription improves margins. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Q4 projections are in red. Note difference in revenue and sub expenses as subscription rises. That is due to ad revenue.](https://preview.redd.it/hkxo7zoams081.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dba1b9c95bfe2f1e359f4b19cd0f18827b15e8c)

Fubo's path to profitibility is mainly volume on subscription. At their current ARPU, they'll need about 4 million subs to reach profitibility. They have been growing their subscription base very rapidly. Last year during Q2, they had just 250k subscribers. They gained more than that last quarter alone! There are still 71 million households that have yet to cut the cord. Huge market to tap. 

Of all the above, I didnt include Fubo's sports betting side of business. The company has recently went live in Iowa with many states to come. They plan to go live in 2 more states during Q1 of next year. The potential revenue would only improve Fubo's margins given the poor margins of streaming. Below, you can see the potential revenue a state as small as Iowa can bring per month. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Note: this was for the month of October when Fubo wasnt live yet. Those bets were likely tests. The average sportsbook took in millions in revenue for October alone. ](https://preview.redd.it/gr4ev2qbps081.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a27e1a8fbf35dd58c68e3152a6a0384e00b0acaf)

Fubo currently has $400 million cash on hand. Their net loss last quarter amounted to $100 million due to marketing. Their net losses should only continue to decrease with rising subscription base. They also have a $500 million shelf that theyve only tapped $70 million out of. I do not anticipate much dilution in the short term. Take a look at the chart below to see how expenses continue to drop percentage wise in relation to revenue. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Expenses continue to decrease with rising subs and ARPU!](https://preview.redd.it/9c8j1kizqs081.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c57368988356b8f50fce59009349ed5c6e458243)

**Challenges**

Fubo's main long term challenge is their ability to maintain and acquire sports content to remain a leader in sports streaming. They've just lost La Liga to ESPN+ and even were outbidded by NBC for the Premier League. Their competition just has deeper pockets in obtaining content. Fubo will have to deeply invest into interactivity and tech to retain customers along with retaining and acquiring sports content. All of which, are very expensive for a company already losing money. 

TL;DR: Fubo will smash q4 earnings with record $25 mil ad revenue. All of which will cutdown on net loss.

If you consider they may take half the time (4 years) to reach TSLA's production numbers because they borrowed TSLA's engineers who've been through this- it should be around the 2017 mktcap x 4x (for current hotness of ev sector)= $60Bx4= $240B.

# Nov. 19 - US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks declined as a result of aggressive comments from Federal Reserve officials and growing anxiety that a new wave of the pandemic in Europe could prompt more lockdowns.
* Companies that are economically sensitive, such as oil, banking, and industrial stocks, have fallen, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 has outperformed major benchmarks.
* The treasury curve flattened after two members of the Federal Reserve's board of directors suggested that, in light of strong economic growth and increasing inflation, the Fed may need to consider speeding up the reduction of its bond-buying program. The dollar increased.
* While stock prices are approaching all-time highs, bolstered by strong earnings, a viral comeback may halt the economic recovery at a time when inflation is at an all-time high.
* Austria was the first country in Western Europe to adopt sweeping restrictions. Non-essential businesses were also closed in areas of Germany, and the Netherlands had previously ordered shops and bars to close early.
* Biden's centrepiece plan to extend the social safety net, confront climate change, and reform tax policies passed the House of Representatives on Friday morning, with House Rep. Speaker Pelosi uniting divided Democrats to send the bill to the Senate, where its fate remains uncertain.

 So I've been contemplating buying into Ship for a while now but I've been waiting for big enough reasons to catch the tail of this giant's gainporn       

 Every time it drops down to the current level (92) it absolutely bangs and the risk to reward is veryyyy minimal, whether you're a long term investor, a yolo'er or a quick in and out kinda guy/lady this stock is Le tits. 

 So what's good about it other than it gets kicked around like a football and we're at the bottom of the support rn, there's a number of upsides;

 Most recent is that stamatis tsantanis the Chairman and CEO of Ship has just announced last week that they've made bids of up to $205 million in ore supplies 

[https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/seanergy-maritime-makes-205m-bet-on-iron-ore-and-coal/2-1-1094827](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/seanergy-maritime-makes-205m-bet-on-iron-ore-and-coal/2-1-1094827)

This comes after last months big news that they've just confirmed they've acquired their latest cape size vessel in a bid from a third party (undisclosed) making it their 17th in their fleet. Thus expanding their ability to cope with ever growing demand of the metal ores and various other dry weight materials they ship which is the bulk of their business but not all of it.

 This was funded through the company with cash on hand after having a great third quarter surpassing expectations and led to a massive gain porn in Sept. 

 China does play a big part in what could result in another huge gain porn and it is as follows;

 Recently there's been a massive shortage of coal however the Chinese Govt have been working directly on this and ensuring their mining facilities are propped up as they've had to issue a severe weather warning for cold conditions this winter (what I believe was linked to the recent drop on the Baltic Dry Index amongst a number of other factors like the drop in value of Russian banks etc.). Regardless these issues have been sorted from what I've read and I've been seeing a noticeable improvement albeit small on the vast majority of mining companies share values such as (won't let me list tickers as one's 'banned' German copper mining whom even announced despite pandemic levels they're smashing it on profit etc. 

 Mining is literally a goldmine, it'll be around until the planet is baron and it's one of the most lucrative markets.

 There has been a huge impact of shipping delays and holding of transport this year especially in America which has caused set backs however that has been sorted (back in June). 

 Most importantly it's just had it's ranking by Tate Sullivan of Maxim's group not only confirmed they're still advising a buy but it's been valued at as high as $2.50 from it's current level of 0.9435 and is currently up 2.55% after market volume. The general consensus seems to be a 'strong buy'.

This was followed by another rating being upgraded on the MW platform from hold to buy making it 3/5 buy/strong buy but I can't get access to who it was.

 This stock is heavillyyyyyy undervalued in terms of demand, what it brings to the market and its cash/earnings. Think we're gonna see huge things but I'm being conservative even if it's only 20-30% gains short term I'm going to be playing both long term and short term holds. Also the demand for metals and other various supplies required for the car sector, construction, military vehicle/ship fabricating etc. plays right into SHIP'S hands.

So are we about to fucking moon it ? I dunno but I bought just under 8,000 units last week and if we do drop any more and see a recovery I'll be loading up with 40k of my savings from this last years gains. To be honest I'M FUCKING BULLISH on this stock I've been skimming the last week to get some extra profit in. Photo as proof of my current position. 

 Even if we do have mass lockdowns construction continued and thanks to having mass government influence especially with the importing of steel etc. for it we saw that they stayed afloat without getting fucked up and came out of the starting blocks fulllllll steam ahead... good ship. 

 Been seeing some good resistance the last week which is great, personally see it as a downward wedge on Ta, also been in a consecutive channel sideways or a triangle but either way we're at a support, it's holding and there's been upper touches with great track record.

  At this point I wanted to share this all with you retards as all I see every day is more good signs in the sector, constant good news shouted out on platforms and I'm close to just pooping gold I can feel it.

Apple has already started using LPDDR5 in their products. Intel's Alder lake is already using DDR5 in the highest end chipsets. AMD is about to launch their Zen3D and Zen4 products with DDR5 support. I'm not even touching on how beneficial ddr5 is to datacenter/enterprise.

More and more products will go DDR5-only and these products are launching earlier in this cycle than they did in the ddr3 or ddr4 cycles plus the demand for tech hardware is waaaaaay above what it was 7 years ago.

For the next 6-12 months, MU's competitors will be selling 100% of the DDR5 and LPDDR5 they can make just like MU. This is a rising tide that will raise all boats.

On top of that, Micron is the only supplier of GDDR6X used in the higher end Nvidia GeForce rtx 30 series cards which have been selling out in seconds for over a year now with no end in sight.

Good bet that other GPUs from AMD and even Intel will start using GDDR6X in the near future. Cheaper than HBM2 while delivering excellent performance.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyf7fb/what_is_micron_technology_mu_and_why_is_it/hlirlky/

2,"11/21/2021, 23:46:07",hliqj8w,PlsDontNuke,"&gt; Why would you be changing to upward?

Jet engines operate better in thick atmosphere and rockets operate better in no atmosphere. Neither is very effective for pushing you through the air resistance of the thin upper atmospheric layers so the first SSTOs will likely work by being durable enough to transfer their forward momentum at maximum jet altitude into upward momentum to skip the upper atmosphere. However maybe not considering the SR-71 is *less* durable than other very fast planes, to save weight. It's just in simulations you'd have to save a lot of weight for extra time spent in the atmosphere to be a net improvement compared to bulking up the plane a little to do a crazy atmospheric bouncing maneuver through the upper layers using forward momentum.

&gt; Jet fuel and rocket fuel can be the same fuel, you just carry oxidizer for when the air is too thin to burn in a jet.

Point is the oxidizer is heavy as fuck and it's hard to imagine how to avoid having the additional engine hardware be heavy too.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxpg75/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/hliqj8w/

They may be bag holders now, but every stockholder is in a sense, unless you are only trading in options. Its half meme, half fuck the current state of institutional investing, where the big guys makes all the plays, determine market sentiment, and front load all the transactions they want. Retail apes gets finally to make some of the calls. 

They (at least initially) beat the industry at their own game. They are DRSing shares that they found dont even exist in brokers inventories, because brokers have been over loaning out ghost shares and kicking the can down the road.  They are moving them away from shitty brokers who sell order flows and front load orders. IMO its more about fuck the institution, then it is about getting rich off GME/AMC, though this might be the goal for some. There are stupid memes all over the internet, at least this one has some goals, intent, and action behind it.

People are fighting for food every day. Market pay and COLA increases are becoming a joke for most people. I really hope people arent betting a lifes worth of lunch money on this shit, but to each their own. Just like I enjoy seeing workers unionize to see better pay and working conditions for their work, I like seeing investors see the imbalances in the stock market, and look for positive change there.

1,"11/21/2021, 23:03:00",hlikju5,Viva-La-Pepe,"I do the wheel strategy and I have bought and sold PLTR at a profit repeatedly in 2021.

That being said, the danger is that PLTR is in an overall downward trend.  I don't know how long the $26 mark will hold. 

Last September I sold 200 shares with  27 calls and 100 with a 26.5 calls. Made something like $1,200 in a very short amount of time. I screwed up though, because I bought back in way too soon, and the last week and a half have been bad.

I'm sitting on 200 shares with a cost basis of $24.22 and the stock is down to $21.41, my strategy for PLTR this upcoming week is too watch for any big rips to sell the shares and then try to rebuy at a lower price.

While I like PLTR and think it will be a successful company, they are diluting the shares for ""employee compensation."" Then these people are cashing in on these shares. Karp just sold $42 million worth and when news hit, it triggered another big selloff.

Consider that Karp made a video recently where he brags that PLTR could ""20x,"" (or something crazy like that) and then he turns around and dumps a shit load of shares after the stock had already been falling for days.

2,"11/21/2021, 22:49:15",hliiqxm,PlsDontNuke,"In my opinion the SR-71 design would get you 0% closer to developing an SSTO. You have to move more than 5x faster than the SR-71 in order to orbit at the same height as the ISS which isn't even that high. And that's actually way more than 5x as difficult because these difficulties add up exponentially. And to do it with an SSTO you have to build up a lot of that speed in the air just like the Blackbird does but then handle the insane aerodynamic forces of changing your direction from sideways to upward, while stowing a fair amount of rocket fuel and additional engine hardware for the out-of-atmosphere maneuvering. And the Blackbird already had basically 0 payload capability.

But before worrying about the aerodynamic forces, let's make an engine that's at least a quarter of the way to being powerful enough, because that's the main thing. Again, it would take some Manhattan project type shit, not just one billionaire and his homies",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxpg75/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/hliiqxm/

1,"11/21/2021, 22:21:35",hlifdoo,Viva-La-Pepe,"I'm bullish on FUBO. I use it for the wheel. I'm down on my current position, but my YTD for FUBO is still positive overall.

Based on what I have read, FUBO's plan is to cover gaps in revenue with the emerging legalized sports betting industry. While there is going to be a lot of competition, I feel that people who subscribe to FUBO are naturally going to use FUBO for their sports betting.  FUBO also wants to bring European style sports betting where you can place wagers to events during the game in real time.

The main gap in FUBO right now is the Turner Network channels TNT &amp; TBS. FUBO Says they are just charging to damn much. The execs at FUBO hope that having features other streaming services do not, like split screen and cloud recording, will compensate for not having TNT &amp; TBS in the short term.

In the long term, they feel that Turner will either come down in price as they leverage their going number of subscribers, or the Turner/AT&amp;T/Warner network will simply go bust and the channels will be sold off to other networks.

Rittenhouse was legally allowed to carry his gun that night as Wisconsin law says that minors can carry shotgun and/or rifles as long as theyre at least the legal minimum barrel length at 16 inches; his gun was longer than that. So, he was allowed to carry it. Rosenbaum, who was a convicted child predator, is someone Im not losing sleep over.

Back in 2018 I paid $180 for 16 GB of slow 2400 mhz DDR4, I could buy 16 GB of 3200 Mhz DDR4 for $80 today. My understanding was that price fixing was a reaction to bad market conditions with a surplus of semiconductors making production of DRAM unprofitable, or at least very low margin. 

With semiconductors cutting production is more expensive than running at a loss. What prevents MU's competitors (which are much bigger) to flud the DRAM market with cheaper products? This has in fact happened several times in the past with ridiculously low DRAM prices.

Why would there need to be ""multiples"" and within what time frame? You think 500 miles is doable but don't see that as dramatic improvement over 350 miles? This doesn't make a lot of sense.

And is this for a vehicle of any kind? Or are we talking passenger vehicles without looking at price? Just looking at max range? Or should price also be included? Just trying to figure out where the goalposts are going to be moving soon.

I think 500 miles will be exceeded quite easily by passenger vehicles in 2030 cheaper than the lucid air. But after a certain point it likely becomes unnecessary to increase range for most models and they'll just make cars cheaper instead of stuffing them to the brim with batteries.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qygxsj/ford_wants_to_produce_600000_electric_cars_a_year/hli7n90/

Regarding deferred revenue, you mean Fraud Self Driving?

Margins in 2030 will be lower than now:
A) competition
B) phasing out of various incentives and tax rebates
C) in order to increase production from 1M to 10M they need to introduce much cheaper models with lower margins (or reduce substantially the prices of current models).

People got overexcited with this years margins which really is just Tesla exploiting current situation by increasing prices (what now 5K on 40K car or something like that).

It would take an act of government to even enact something like this then they would have to play hardball with Taiwan or China to get them to even listen and more than likely they will just say fuck off.  Yeah we've got a chip maker in the US that cant even satisfy a fraction of the demand.

But I don't believe for a second there will be growth in terms of multiples. 
I will reserve my judgement for lucid until there is more real world data. They don't produce any batteries, so whatever efficiency they have found is coming from the car design itself.

The pharmacy model is the baseline so far. A huge victory, but one of the main critiques so far comes from not including the insufficent driving laws and growing yourself. 

If they have not addressed that, in all of those weeks, I highly doubt they will update that diatmetrical problem anytime soon. Reality will be you can buy it finally, but cannot drive without massive problems and neither grow it yourself. The ramping problem of cannabis drug tests especially in certain public job areas like has ever been nonsense here in Germany. That will also not be addressed as it would be a states issue conflict field e.g. as police is a state issue, not union.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qys7gd/tlry_ready_to_ramp_up_weed_production_in_germany/hli5qk4/

Also, while I can see a correction and Tesla falling to 800 or so, if its falling 70% we are going to be in such a bad position the EV portion of the market will literally not even matter as everything will be taking massive hits.

This year looks to be landing on well over 3 fold compared to last year. But I guess it is all futile because batteries can't improve significantly even with different chemistries?

At any rate, you still seem to think batteries can't improve in energy density, right? What does that mean in concrete terms? Does that mean you think BEV range will not improve much or at all in the future? You think BEVs will still have a max range of 350 miles in 2030?

2,"11/21/2021, 19:57:16",hli175m,xenogerts,"Nah, there is zero conspiracy.
It is just Legacy Automakers using decades old 35-60 nm chip technologies in their auto, then SUDDENLY canceling on orders. 

Ofc chip makers choose to switch capacities to the latest tech which is also happens to be profitable unlike decades old tech where margins are razor thin.

And when legacy OEMs wanted chips again, they found out that there are no more older foundries for outdated tech existing. 
And you have to pay a huge premiums as the tooling does not exist anymore.
Or you can buy the latest tech, however, you again have to pay a huge premium and to re-engineer your systems for new technology.

Thus a myth of chip shortages was born. Legacy OEMs try to shift their own fail and their own fault of using decades old tech onto chipmakers, by changing narrative to that of alleged chip shortage.

So, that ""chip shortage"" would be a thing until all of  dinosaur OEM go to grave.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyqk2a/conspiracy_theory_featuring_tesla_and_the_chip/hli175m/

1,"11/21/2021, 19:54:57",hli10fg,WarrenBuffettsBuffet,"&gt;... But TSLA sure will. 

&gt;It's not Evergrand or housing sector at all that's going to crash the market. For all the previous crashes and bubbles burst were unique and different.

&gt;There is only one bubble huge enough to bring down the whole global economy. AND IT IS NOT EVERGRAND.

&gt;IT'S THE EVs BUBBLE. It's TSLA, LCID, RIVIN, FSR, NIO etc. 

&gt;Tesla with over 1 trillion market cap is worth more than all car makers together not Toyota that sells multiple million cars very year. Rivian rallied to be the 3 biggest automotive manufacturer in the world bypassing volkswagen without any revenue. Volkswagen the owner of audi, Porsche, Bentley, Scania, man, Skoda, SEAT, VW etc.

&gt;Everyone is aware of global chip shortage and supply chain issues. EV needs 10x more chips than usual automotive. Elon musk selling billion of dollars in TSLA stock for nor reason and the stock is still over 1000$ per share. 

&gt;some wrinkle brain can pick up from here and can provide you with additional information.

&gt;Non financial advice! 

&gt;Edit: wow! That many awards, thank you!

The demand for chips in March 2020 dropped a lot during Covid and a lot of manufacturers decreased their orders. Also the chip industry reduced their output due to the decreasing demand. Half a year later the market skyrockets, people didn't spend money during Covid and want to spend their money NOW. Well, but the supply chain got just reduced and the orders for chips were low. Ramping everything up to satisfy the pre COVID + extra demand takes time. No conspiracy, it's all easy to explain.

Weed is and was always massive in Germany. Especially in the northern and western region its common that people at least tried it once.

Yearly estimated around 200-400 tons of weed are consumed. ( 890.000 pound ) even tho its illegal.
Cannabis black market value is estimated around 1.2 to 2.5 billion  a year.
Over 25% of the younger generations have smoked during Covid.

This is why the new parties benefit so much from the weed legalization topic for votes.
Wanna check the popularity yourself ? Type in YouTube Cannabis legal or kiffen legal and see how massive the amount of views for those German videos are. Not uncommon to find videos with 400-700k views in a couple weeks.

About Tilray: 
They have their European headquarter in Germany and grow &amp; sell since 2017, back when nobody was even expecting a legalization.
They already had conversations with pharmacies to supply them when legalization starts because the parties agreed that the first step is to sell in them.

1,"11/21/2021, 18:59:41",hlhwmpt,Blackcameleopard,"If it wasnt a folding phone or the newest flagship iPhone or Samsung its because theyre even more obsolete. Honestly buying a phone that didnt come out in oct/nov in those months is a good choice. Obviously a newer phone like going iPhone 6 to 10 is still an advance in everything, but its not cool. Regardless older models take up space that newer ones that sell easier could take up. A pallet of blackberries that you cant move are making you miss on the opportunity of buying one more pallet of phones that are selling like fire. Phones have crazy margins though. They refuse to sell you a phone flat out at the equivalent price because they lose out on the opportunity of more money. If youd be budgeting for it but just one missed payment means 25 percent apr on 1/24th. Thats an extra 80 cents since its like a lil over 2 percent for missing that 40 dollar payment. Yet that keeps stacking while the 2 percent of 40 wasnt crazy miss a year because of a year shut down. Chances are it wont just be one.  Take a how they sold 200 million phones since 2014. A person buying a new iPhone could have put 10k in gme at the top or Tesla puts and now not have the funds. If the statistic still stands most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. So the pandemic meant that cc companies got mondo bucks coming in eventually if people dont file for bankruptcy to clear the debt which most people dont do. Then you apply that to the Tesla scheme, well I dont own one so I wouldnt know exactly how it is, but cars generally are 60 months with a lower apr. Its 60-80 x the payment. Yet Tesla does not have the issue apple has where they share the market with every single cell service provider on top of tech stores. They handed off distribution so they cant keep all the money like Tesla does. 




When it comes to shortage I would better assess that anyone involved in the China business market had an advantage to prepare for obvious shortages. Elon has a factory there I am sure he heard of a new not flu type issue. Tesla doesnt make their chips, right? You can make contracts earlier. Covid didnt cause shutdowns instantly. I think Elon being a bit of a control freak and workhouse knew about it. While China was buying back masks at an initial loss I feel sure Musk was signing chip contracts. I would be interested to know where most of the current chips are going, but it hasnt piqued my interest enough to.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyqk2a/conspiracy_theory_featuring_tesla_and_the_chip/hlhwmpt/

0,"11/21/2021, 18:08:11",hlhspiv,tms102,"&gt;Batteries have by and large not improved at all. There has been minor improvements in terms of space saving by the way they are constructed. But the actual energy storage medium hasnt improved at all, energy storage is at at an atom level limitation and it's very unlikely this will ever be overcome.

Battery energy density has been improving:

&amp;#x200B;

The price improves all the time as well:

Tesla plans to improve the range of the vehicle through new chemistry of the cell, new design of the cell dimensions, and cell pack, and structure of the vehicle itself as well.

Solid-state batteries are coming and new battery chemistries in general are being developed as well.

&gt;""Currently our solid-state batteries have an energy density of about 400 watt-hours per kilogram, which is about double the typical energy density of commercial lithium-ion batteries on the market,"" Omar says. ""By 2025, we aim to achieve an energy density of 450 watt-hours per kilogram.""

[https://spectrum.ieee.org/solid-state-battery](https://spectrum.ieee.org/solid-state-battery)

There are lots of other developments in progress as well:

Now that BEVs are truly becoming mainstream there is way more investment going to battery research and development. If you think battery energy density per Kg and charging times will not improve even more over the next 10 years, you are out of your mind.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qygxsj/ford_wants_to_produce_600000_electric_cars_a_year/hlhspiv/

This isn't an attempt to get her back, seriously, fuck that girl. Shitty people do shitty things, and unfortunately you got caught up in that shit. 

Now that all of that dead weight is off of you, better yourself. Read a book, lift some weights, learn a new skill. Focus on you, and focus on getting back to a better place after what that unfortunately lady did to you.

If you focus on improving yourself, you'll meet new people, meet new girls, and eventually find yourself in a much, much better place than you are today.

If you come out of this breakup as a better version of yourself, you win. If you spiral into depression and sadness, she wins.

I dont wish bad upon you man, I really dont. Im just so tired of seeing this and knowing that inevitably they will blame retail consumers (which have a part but are not the major money movers ((makers)) in the market) because people say hAhA iF yOu WaNt To LoSe MoNeY bEt AgAiNsT tEsLa. One day this wont be true and not by a long shot. You may think youll get out early but you wont and youll be the same person that complains about hedge funds and banks when you were just as a part of the greed as they were. 

Im posting this because Im drunk and annoyed with the unbelievable echo chamber that exists here and everywhere else. Retail traders will get murdered when this market crashes and I dont know when and Im not Michael Burry so I wont lie to you. I know it will though and I know all of you people invested in a company that hasnt sold a car (Rivian) will blame someone else but yourself. 

This isnt 2008. You cant blame AIG, JPM, GS or Lehman Bros. It will be your fault. It wont be your actual fault, but youll give big money a fucking reason to testify in front a congress and say Look, we just did what everyone else was doing. The only difference is they do this for a living and will get out and hedge and help themselves much faster than you know how to.

The worst part of this is that I want to come to this sub, and many others, and see you people hurt. Thats not who I am and I hate that I feel like that. But here it is, Ive been saying it forever and everyone here not only ignores it but actually threatens me for saying something different from their opinion. Its a cautionary taleI may never be right but I can promise to fucking god there is a reason why big money has participated in all of the shenanigans that exists here.

1,"11/21/2021, 16:13:58",hlhk3ud,anon57842,"accounting. 

you can get into finance with accounting. somewhat more difficult to get into accounting with finance. but take courses in both, along with statistics, coding, chemistry, engineering, law, and history (as long as it isn't useless woke bs). talent stacking.

that said, degree doesn't matter. you succeed by doing whatever to make money for your firm.

if you're on the sell side, that's finding/structuring deals or generating transactions.

if you're on the buy side, that's increasing aum or sourcing good investments.

if you're in an accounting or law firm, that's finding companies that'll use your services. i.e., having/creating name recognition in a specialized field (e.g., cost and trasnfer pricing accounting/law for us military approved chip fab plants, structuring efficient vehicles for private credit for multi-family offices, whatever). 

a degree is only as good as your first job or graduate school. you make your own success in life. good luck retard.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxpg75/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/hlhk3ud/

I have several accounts through fidelity including my current work retirement that I plan on rolling into my Roth after contributing 19,500 next year (I am living off my trading and have my work retirement set up to put in everything except my deductions into my retirement) I never put more than for my employer match because I knew I could do better than my 401k in the market.

I hope I do meet her, but I hope I'm still poor when it happens. I hope everything she can find out about me via court or whatever after I slap her, it's all so pathetic it leaves her with no way to feel like this is ""a straight white male oppressing"" her. If I'm already rich by the time it happens then I have a better chance of avoiding jail but a much worse chance of the slap being worth it. The only way she'll take it personally and receive a shock to her worldview is if she can see me as an equal instead of a ""straight white male."" *Being* her equal isn't enough, I have to be so fuckin pathetic she can't even *pretend* I'm an alien or whatever these bitches think.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxpg75/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/hlhi708/

I hope I do meet her, but I hope I'm still poor when it happens. I hope everything she can find out about me via court or whatever after I slap her, it's all so pathetic it leaves her with no way to feel like this is ""a straight white male oppressing"" her. If I'm already rich by the time it happens then I have a better chance of avoiding jail but a much worse chance of the slap being worth it. The only way she'll take it personally and receive a shock to her worldview is if she can see me as an equal instead of a ""straight white male."" *Being* her equal isn't enough, I have to be so fuckin pathetic she can't even *pretend* I'm an alien or whatever these bitches think.

You cant do level 3 in a retirement account, because you cant actually borrow against your cash where you could lose more than what is in your account. But the plus part after regular level 2 opens options for certain spreads and gives you what is considered a limited margin. Basically, it allows you to margin Trade the amount of cash that is in your account and then it comes out of your cash to satisfy the margin call if you lose any at the end of the day. It is basically the same as a cash account except it gets rid of the requirement to wait for funds to settle before trading that money again.

As a short-time fan of the anime, I'm more upset about the woman herself. Like, not the show itself. I feel more like the kind of pissed off you get when someone walks into a room and starts talking shit about you than the kind of pissed off you get watching a bad adaptation of something you love. I take it really personally how she decided to insult the character and fans. It's more of a desire to make her feel like she's been stood up to by someone she bullied than a desire to see a better version of Cowboy Bebop.

Ended up hating everything about those course, especially as I got more along, to the point where they became unbearable. Graduated with a useless psych degree, and didn't even end up pursuing medicine because I hated it sooooo much. Working 7 days a week now. Few yrs later younger cousin was getting ready for college, and his parents too were forcing him to pursue the medical line before I told his ass straight up not to do it unless you were passionate for that shit. Convinved him to do a CS degree and that even as a 2.0 student he'd he good as long as he got that degree. Now he's working a good job, and a great work/life balance.

She shouldn't have taken the job if she has hangups that force her to insult the shit out of the character and her fans, and since society wants to reward her for being a selfish bitch, I'd have to take it upon myself to slap her in the face for this shit if I had the chance. Sucks that I'd get sent to jail for doing a public service while she got paid for her character vandalism, but the amount of jail time I'd get for one slap is nowhere near enough to make me give a shit compared to how satisfying it would be to know she spent one moment with a stinging cheek amidst her lifetime of selfish comfort, and she will never be fully comfortable with her selfishness again knowing someone would hold onto the feeling of wanting to slap her for however long it takes to get the chance. If you think I'm not serious, I've already had 2 times in my life where I did this type of calculus and chose jail time over letting some shit slide, and in one of those two cases I can still look back and say I'm pretty satisfied with the outcome, so I'm actually not unserious at all.

Did you mean the [Queen of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_the_United_Kingdom), the [Queen of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada), the [Queen of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia), etc?

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

5,"11/21/2021, 13:33:05",hlh6irr,teplightyear,"The stock market in general is in a massive speculative bubble.  I wouldn't say that established companies are undervalued as much as I'd say they haven't been targeted by speculators yet.  If those established companies don't get wildly overvalued, it may limit the scope of the bubble, and thus the impact of it's popping.  If they do get wildly overvalued, then maybe they get caught up in the pop.  Speculation is the problem, so established companies maintaining a reasonable value actually shows that the market isn't *entirely* fucked yet.


And even still, the decisions executives make at the top of a bubble can mitigate damage from the pop, too.  I have to believe that Musk cashing out billions of dollars worth of stock and having a shit-ton of cash on hand puts him in a pretty decent position nonetheless if the value of Tesla's stock plummets.  It's the people buying Tesla at $900+ that get fucked, not the boss or the company.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qylzeq/not_evergrand_will_collapse_the_global_economy/hlh6irr/

If I buy the deepest ITM call at an expiration months/years from now using all of my money, am I guaranteed that I will make more money with this strategy than if I only bought pure stock? I know leverage wouldnt be super high but is it pretty much guaranteed as long as the stock price does go up before expiration?

Basically Im really bullish on dutch bros and I want to throw my entire savings at it by purchasing the deepest call at the furthest expiration date.

The thing to be concerned about is when EVs pop its very possible so will everything else. Its not the same economy it was when the dotcom fiasco was going on. Weve had plenty of MASSIVE losers this year. My point being, right now one emerging industry being purged that most people are gambling on who will survive is not going to wipe us out, but when that purge happens, we have to worry about how MANY industries get purged. Rivian, Lucid and some others get fucked youre not gonna see much change. Itll happen just like Nikola is currently. Youll have dips in TSLA &amp; some of the charging companies etc but theyll survive the same way you saw greats like Amazon, EBay, Adobe etc. you dont need to worry about the clear leader of the pack which is Tesla because its simply not going to disappear the same way you didnt need to worry about Amazon in dotcom.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qylzeq/not_evergrand_will_collapse_the_global_economy/hlh53g2/

A normal car would *technically* come out on top for reliability, IF the study treats all issues the same regardless of their impact. The Tesla's issues though generally don't impact the ability of the car to drive, they're more like various levels of annoyance, like the gimmicky pop out door handles that fail and then you can't open that door. Traditional cars have less issues like that because they've had plenty of time to iron out the bugs, but the bugs that remain are like ""oh yeah the timing belt can break and it will literally destroy your engine"" level of mechanical problems.

Basically, I would expect that even a VW is technically more reliable than a Tesla when you include every single feature in reliability, but if you torture tested both purely based on mechanical reliability, the VW is going to break down long before the Tesla. The Tesla will annoy the fuck out of you along the way with stupid little peripheral shit breaking and costing way too much to repair though.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qykw6v/tesla_over_the_weekend_when_i_dont_own_calls_vs/hlh1511/

Online date flaked out on me and I was really horny. Took some adderall and decided to break my escort cherry.

 Cheapest available now escort responded almost immediately, should have known right there. Kinda ugly in the face, kinda old. Big tits and ass though. The adderall liked the pics. Got to her place, paranoid as fuck that it was going to be a cop. I show up, she's definitely uglier in person and could be pushin 50.  But I tried to focus on the tits, I couldn't get hard. When I finally did I came in like 2 mins. I scheduled for an hour. I did muster up a second blast but it was getting pathetic. Whole thing showed me never skimp on your escort and pay for the least amount of time. Also fuck these photo edits/filters/whatever the fuck they do.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Nonetheless, it can-not be understated that this is still a full fledged pandemic, not having died down in the least. 

In regard to the possibility for researching endemic status in January, this is next to impossible. Only due to a significant portion of the population possessing easily escapable immunity (as it only targets the S-protein). 

Thus, rather than endemic status being reached in January, it will likely mark the beginning of the propagation of a full immune escape protein (against anti-s-protein vaccine mediated antibodies).

His argument is logical. No major faults can be seen. Considering the narrow immune pressure, and rapid evolution of the virus in light of a homogenous immune response (s-protein antibodies) among most of the vaccinated population, the propagation of a unique immune escape variant of the s-protein appears likely.

Considering these vaccine mediated antibodies will still outcompete the innate immune system, upon encountering the new immuno-escape variant, the response will the weakened. Thus, significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates among the population.

I cant make a certain judgement to whether he will be proven right. Feel free to research more into Geert Vanden Bossche and his ideas. If he is correct, there will indeed be a crash.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qym2vb/potential_for_market_downturn_due_to_dynamics_of/hlgvmax/

As long as Elon is there. If he leaves....total anarchy. It's going to take something else I think, to crash the market. 

I chose to start a new paragraph instead of a thread, but if anyone sees this and has an opinion, I would love to hear thoughts on the possibility, of no more market crashes, in the future.

1,"11/21/2021, 10:30:02",hlgmv7x,LouisDesyjr,"1: 20% down, while 'not good'; is not a disaster. You can make the money back over the course of 2 or 3 years, maybe sooner.

2: For the furture, NEVER invest more than what you would be comfortable if it all went to zero. That way your losses will not effect other areas of your life, like work or sleep or friendships/relationships.

3: Have most of your portfolio in more conservative investments and keep your speculative part to a small part of your portfolio, such that even if the speculative part goes to zero, you will still show a profit for the year. That way if things go bad on a postion, you are just making less for the year, you are not looking at your savings going down or being wiped out. Over time you will find as things grow, and you get better on the speculative part, you will be way ahead.

4: You have one big advantage that many of us her do not have, compounding over time as in decades. You will find going out 20 or 30 years, that as long as you are disciplined, that any losses you suffer now 'are part of the cost of learning'. While one can read all kinds of books on investing, subscribe to various sources and such; there is no substitute for actually 'pulling the trigger' and establishing a position, and then being disciplined to manage it properly with all of the questions on has as time goes on. If there is a spike, should one sell or just hold? What if there is a big drop, should the position be closed because the initial hypothesis was wrong or is this an opportunity to add more to a postion that is now undervalued? Am I right or is the market right? Is the stock 'broken' or the company?

The board was being refreshed with people who knew gaming and the end of year was during a new generation of consoles launching.

1. I think the current run up is DLTR stock catching up to it's true valuation. Also it is possible that the numbers may have been leaked and some people in the know may be buying based on that. Part of the runup in the past 2 weeks is because an activist is getting involved. The competition is irrelevant since my thesis is just for the earnings report only.
2. AEO used to advertise that they make most of their clothes in USA. Based on that I assume that compared other retailer they have less relative exposure to China. Even a little bit of production here will keep shelves stocked.
3. I'm more bullish on ANF. Their target demographics of affluent teens is more desirable. It's hard to differentiate which retailer will report better numbers. In my mind (bullish) ANF&gt;AEO&gt;URBN (bearish).

Ps. AEO is all about Aerie. Otherwise I would have bought only ANF.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy6yq4/retailer_earnings_report_next_week/hlgh2bu/

That capitalist comment was my own opinion. Not what the book said. Yes, capitalists make tremendous risks and sacrifices. As I said, I agree with capitalists ideology too.

Ford has a lot of vehicles setting around parking lots and airport inventory fields. These are all waiting for chip sets.  As they get excess chip sets they will be finishing those vechicles and shipping them.  Ford's customers are the dealers.  As soon as they ship a unit, it is a sale.  I have no idea how long it will take to ship all of the work-in-progress inventory to dealers, but this should help the numbers over this quarter and maybe the next two.  By that time all the production should be in full swing.  Also, sometime next year Argo IA  may go public.  Volkswagen and Ford each own 40% of that company.

Jumping back,  working the above comments into the conversion,  we now have Ford paying a dividend.  A stock buyback would be better, but considering the shareholder base, that should help hold those investors tight.  In January (and each month) we will get sales numbers and at the end of the month a fourth quarter report. By the end of March we will get the Annual Report (10-K) which might show a marked up book value of Rivian.  Ford has about 100 million shares with a cost basis of about US$ 1.2 billion.  They could easy write up that asset by two billion dollars.  I have no idea what their net operating losses and long term capital losses look like on their tax returns . . . .

2,"11/21/2021, 08:21:46",hlg73c8,Nekommando,"No offense taken.

Yes, looking from raw numbers PLA is massive, but in a invasion there only so much planes/ warships/ troops can fit in a finite space. 

In the context of conventional invasion in the Taiwan strait, the numbers of planes at the airspace at one time is severely limited, some projections say no more than 6 fighters at one time, so the fight for air supremacy will drag on months. Similar things for warships, neither side wants their fleet to cluster up and get absolutely Fucked by missiles. 

You can watch some of the simulation/projection scenarios on YouTube. Those are not 100% accurate and often leaves political discussion out, but they gives you insight on why there is a huge bottleneck in a invasion.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy05dr/tsm_is_going_to_200_by_april/hlg73c8/

I actually had to keep hoping back to their shitty old interface, somehow their beta interface is even worse

here are their worst problems:

1.  it is a pain in the ass to create spreads and multi-leg setups

2.  prices take forever to update, I actually had to use robinhood to get more real time pricing while getting ready to buy our sell options

3.  their P/L took forever to update with options, like I would close the day at some value in my account and later the value would say something different, way off like by the thousands.  I would have to manually add the individual options closing process to know what my account was at

4. forget about rolling options in one transaction, it was pretty much impossible

I'll take robinhood thank you very much",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxpg75/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/hlg2yvg/

In your case the thesis doesnt make sense to me.

DRAM has started an upgrade supercycle from DDR4 to DDR5. The cycle usually happens once every 7 years and takes 2-3 years for sales of new ram to overtake sales of older ram.

DDR5 has a lot of advantages over DDR4. Many won't be apparent to the average user during the first part of the upgrade supercycle.

A ton of analysts were downgrading micron earlier this year because they completely missed the fact that an upgrade supercycle was coming and focused on DDR4 price trends.

Micron, samsung, and sk hynix are the 3 biggest DRAM suppliers.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyf7fb/what_is_micron_technology_mu_and_why_is_it/hlfzhdz/

Then I got downvoted, attacked, and called a clown. But you're saying I'M the one who is rude, all because I pointed out that GME is a cult with no logical basis behind it. I literally stated the facts. I even offered my firstborn if you are right and the apocalypse happens! And one would THINK that hearing, ""The apocalypse and the world falling to ruin, with Gamestop rising as the main currency and government"" would be enough to make any normal, sane human pause and think, ""That sounds absolutely fucking insane."" But not ya'll! And then you get upset I call you foolish? Sorry, but you are. If that hurts, take some time and think about what the hell you are doing. 



Believe it or not, I'm trying to help talk sense into some of you. If you read this in an angry voice, that's on you - but I didn't write it with any anger. Like I said, more disbelief and annoyance at most. Are you angry at flat earthers when you talk to them about how the earth is round? Are you salty that they ""know the truth and won't listen to you NASA shills?"" LMAO. Of course not. You just think they're nuts. That's what I think of the Apes. That's what MOST normal people think, but you guys have dug so far in to your little echo chamber that you believe it's shill persecution of the chosen people instead of just common people rolling their eyes at you. But I'll give you more grace than flat earthers, since most of you have zero understanding of the markets, and have been sold a shitty bill of goods that you don't understand. Of course, it's up to you to think about it and figure it out, but let's be real - most people don't bother to actually think for themselves.

I also didn't try to represent the FDIC premiums (which you would pay your daddy in the analogy) or the fact that the bank is required to hold some money in reserve (reserve requirements) and mix in some of their own money (capital requirements).

If you were running the same scheme with 10 depositors, reserve requirements would be like if you keep one or two xboxes on hand in case a depositor asks for theirs back before any of your borrowers are due to return one. Capital requirements would be like your dad asking you to buy an xbox or two so he doesn't have to step in whenever a borrower won't return one, only if an unusual number of borrowers won't return theirs at the same time.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwsg1s/if_he_invested_in_lowrisk_government_bonds_yes/hlfvwey/

You either pay small tax bills over quarterly estimates, or one big tax bill annually. The end result is the tax man gets paid. The thing with traders is that it is better to leverage your short term gains because time in the market is better than timing the market. This is why annual filing + penalty is better than paying quarterly estimates.

People have done the math. Turns out, the tax man makes more money when you pay quarterly vs annually.

Imagine a world where Tesla makes as much money as GOOG. So imagine it has 239B in revenue (instead of 47B) and makes 70B in net income (instead of 3.5B). Let's pretend it is also like GOOG and no longer needs big factories or huge materials purchases to grow. How would you value Tesla in that case?

2,"11/21/2021, 06:13:53",hlfqggb,AutoModAccountOpUrk,"Are you okay? I feel for you man. But judging from this you might have problems that go beyond your investing strategy.    

Pull back. Clear your head. Decide on a strategy and stick with it. Be it options or whatever. Strategize. Put on paper when and if you'll sell and stick to it.      

I'm not giving investment advice but maybe consider passive investing while you get back on track. Shares don't have an expiration date and indexes always recover losses in the long run. Don't take the memery of this sub to hearth.   

20k is a lot to loose but don't internalize it. You got stupid, now it's time to get less stupid. You're going to be okay.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx6pjd/im_done_i_am_never_satisfied_with_profits_so_i/hlfqggb/

1,"11/21/2021, 06:11:20",hlfq45h,wagglefree,Its all about revenue growth at this point. Ford already got its EBITA in order with the turnaround plan almost complete. Focus on the November sales figures and if the growth trajectory holds for a third month. At that point it will be clear what positions are best. Also I am glad you didnt miss out too much on selling the covered calls.  In addition I am analyzing multiple securities and will inform you once I conclude my findings. Ford is clearly a great long play at this point. IMO but nothing is ever 100% probable .

I buy in increments, if the price drops I get to add to my position at a lower price. Better than going all in and then having it drop 5% with full position. 

Scale out is same thing but opposite, once Im up 10% or 20% Ill sell a quarter of my shares, once Im up more Ill sell a lil more. Etc.

Couple of Qs

1) DLTR faces a lot of completion from other dollar stores what makes them the right choice here especially given the run up? Make no mistake, I think equity here makes sense but am worried about potential options.

2) AEO also has significant China exposure. Wouldnt supply chain issues globally hamper them?

3) AEO and ANF are pairs in my mind. What give you the comfort that both will rise?

So yeah, it's really possible. I have been solely scalp trading options in a cash account and haven't switched to a margin account yet. 

For learning the basics of options, check ProjectOption on YouTube. Option Alpha and Tastytrade are other channels that are really good (but they are more suitable for intermediate and advanced level options traders, I suppose) in this regard.

Check Matt Diamond on YouTube. He doesn't give out any alerts or anything, rather you can learn so much about options scalping watching his daily recap videos.

Another example is $PROG. Starting the beginning of the week and culminating yesterday it was mostly bullish. But yesterday there was 100% flow of bullish activity with no bear activity.

Im saying - tons of studies have come out showing that over time, the best professionals cant beat the market and this seems to be the consensus among investors. Sure, in a huge bull market like weve had for a while its easier but then the losses come and theyre more significant than those who did index funds. Then over time, the average performance of an index fund buyer surpasses.

So what even if they are ahead of competition? They are already valued more than the next 10 OEMs combined or even more. Being a leader in auto industry in the future doesn't justify the price. And what people also do not sometimes realize is that EVs are still cars. EVs are much more legacy cars, than smartphones were legacy phones at that time. There is much smaller delta. The margins will come down, EV will not be bigger than Auto industry now. EVs will be just that, old boring cars. Just like they are now.

As of other *industries*, as people say ""talk is cheap"". They still need to prove that these other businesses are prominent source of cash. So far the excuses were the are focused on auto business.

The same would apply to real estate unless you purchase something of the same or greater value.  This is what's driving real estate up.  You sell a shitty house in LA for say 900k.  Move to Phoenix and pay cash for two homes.  You avoid the tax and have rental income for life.,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxux0t/not_excited_for_tax_season/hlf8vrs/

6,"11/21/2021, 03:54:39",hlf7x48,chickntrackintrucker,"Hello and welcome, 

This is a gambling subreddit. Here we make extremely high risk ""investments"" in financial derivatives of stocks. (Like options contracts). 

These instruments behave in a complicated manner and I do not recommend you use them. Something like 70% of them are worthless when they expire. 

The stocks that we do buy here don't expire like our options, but many are extremely volatile and lose a lot of value quickly. You'll see $WISH is very popular around here, down to an all time low. Litterally a crap company that sells crap products perfoming like crap, that's the kind of stupidity you'll find here. 

Also lots of crass jokes, dark humor, jokingly rude behavior and plenty of horrible horrible investment suggestions. There is also huge gains and losses that result from this, so if you want to join us we'd be happy to have you; 

However you should only bring money here you intend to gamble with and be conscious of the fact gambling is destructive and addicting so be on the lookout for those signs if you wish to proceed here. 

r/investing  r/stocks r/PersonalFinanceCanada are better places to find real investment advice to grow wealth long term. r/thetagang sells us our financial derivatives and they do fairly well, I suggest going to see them once you have a lot more experience if you want to take on more risk and challenge yourself. That shouldn't be anytime soon though.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyd0jn/help_me/hlf7x48/

But VW and Chinese automakers are interesting. I guess GM and Wuling and VW have mass produced small EVs in China. Selling around $5,000+.

At this rate Tesla will grow into its market cap. 3 factories almost online.

I finally bought Tesla, after thinking it is too overvalued and not believing. Doing some value analysis. Their FCF, rev growth, balance sheet is getting there.

Might be under 200 PE soon. Like Amazon range of 60+.

Other thing going for them is the EV charging infrastructure. Ford and GM are investing. But never heard of their stations.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qya49o/guess_where_gme_happened_and_where_i_shorted/hlf6m1q/

1,"11/21/2021, 03:34:31",hlf56hb,Spare-Help562,"I mean past performance is not indicative of the future, yadda yadda yadda... on the hindsight shorting Tesla at the price of 400 pre-split was a bad idea. But at that time there was a sentiment that company is few days from bankruptcy. I guess for them it was worth the risk?

Turns out it was not a great idea to short it at 800 post-split too! But really not that bad either. Who would could have guessed the crazy run from 800 to 1200 in what, two weeks? Based on  a *good* news I guess, which turned out to be not the news l at all? 

However, I think situations are extremely different. Those times people were really betting that Tesla is going bankrupt, or Tesla would never make a profit without regulatory credits, and so on and so forth. Now, it turned out to be false. However, the price went up (checking notes) about x20 within 2 years. I think it way overshoot. 

And here is my take now. Back then bears were overly pessimistic. Right now, bulls are overly optimistic. They are starting to project 50% growth over the next 10 year. They project increase in margins, although margins within 10 years will certainly go down due to combination of competition as well as phasing out of various tax rebates and subsidies. People are overly optimistic about Tesla MOATs: FSD which is *NOWHERE* to be close to what Elon originally promised (will try to explain myself briefly in follow up Tesla DD), 4680 which is basically just a bigger battery, maybe manufacturing will be cheaper, maybe not? And list goes on and on. People take Elon's words (i mean pumps) for granted. I cannot blame them, he made them shit loads of money. Its unconscious bias. 

Anyway, if there is a better time to short, it is now. When everything rainbow, and Tesla will go to 2T in few months, and 10T by 2030 amirite? Reminds me of Cisco in 2000. It was 500B market cap biggest company in the world (equivalent to 1500B in the current market) and analysts were projecting 2T (in those days) in just few years... turned out to be good for investors, ha?

This may be an unpopular opinion but i only deal in facts.

The facts are this is an online only model that is valued at 14bil market cap - it got way way overpriced and it paid way too much for advertising thinking they could take over the whole gambling industry some day. When the reality is they only get a small market share of gamblers so their biggest draw is the DFS crowd - which is a bumbling enterprise now that most online dfs players have figured out that the millionaire maker and similar contests are setup to ensure the biggest payouts end up in the hands of the players with the biggest bankrolls. 

Add in that draftkings has missed earnings projections (by alot) for 4 quarters in a row. When a company misses earnings this many times in a row it usually means they are announcing higher than projected earnings ahead of time in order to prop up the stock with false info. This is a bad investment and i encourage you to steer clear as long as that market cap is far exceeding $14b

Imagine that number. $14b - compare it to penn national gaming who is valued around $8.8b - and they actually own and operate dozens of brick and mortar casinos all over america and operate slot machine repair services for dozens of others. They also have legit online gaming services nearly equal to DK and yet DK while only operating online betting and DFS is sporting a market cap nearly double that of penn.

Markets open and the stock starts flying up, scooping up all the fomo bros. Then, it slowly drags back down, into another new low.

My plan Monday is to buy some \~32 strike puts during that opening push, when they're cheap. Maybe like $150\~$200 worth.  If this takes off, I do NOT care about that money. But if it falls below the 34\~35 support, then I'm hedged for the possible drop to the 20s people are scared of. If I'm comfortable with my buying power at that point, I'll sell those puts and buy calls out to Feb 18th.",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyboej/draftkings_has_had_two_insiders_buying_share_in/hlf2w3v/

2,"11/21/2021, 03:10:17",hlf1v50,buddumz,Ive been learning allot about your taxes and your capital gains. Remember to my understanding you are still getting taxed based on your income. There for you make under 80k a year your short term realized gain will be taxed with in that tax bracket which I believe is 22%. There for it not being that scary. Just make sure you report everything. Its not worth dealing with this shit later. Average cost for tax guy to go through your trades is 250$. This post is for anyone wondering and nothing to do with the op who posted. Im sure he knows his shit. Please do your research everyone and stay informed. The day you make over 400k you will get taxed federally fuckery. But by then I hope you have llc or something to loop it all through. We are at the beginning of the rest of our lifes.

So you're probably right, he is not going to be margin called.

Since he specifically used UWMC, a mortage lender, to finance this he probably lied to them about the true purpose of the loan.

I'm looking at like $80 a month to watch NFL Sunday ticket or NBA league pass with them. Hulu, Sling, even just paying for cable are all cheaper and I get a better product. You get a 100+ channels, but most are garbage and you don't get streaming.

For me, it's a terrible service because of the price point. If you are saying that it's the most expensive option and it loses money... Maybe it's not a good company. Once the new NBA and NFL TV deals get negotiated and Amazon buys streaming rights, all these companies are dead in the water.

Didnt they fire the CEO and hire key people (product and tech) in last few months?
Didnt they stop spending on digital ad drastically? 
Didnt they reduce the losses? Also cash burn was minimal (cash reduction mostly from lower payables). 
Didnt they rollout wish standards? I think this will be big change.

I bought lucid shares at $18 (different name before) and held through the rise of $60 in early 2020 and then watched it fall back to $20 and just stuck with it for the full year. Was bummed about that but now its flying again.

5,"11/21/2021, 02:30:43",hlew8rh,Grundle_Monster,"Its often repeated but its very important: you always have to have a plan for your tradea plan for when to cut losses, when to take profits-based on a thesis grounded in your knowledge of the market and the underlying. If you lose 20% and stop out of a trade, it only takes a 25% gain on the 80% you have left to get even. If you wait until youre down 50%, you need a 100% gain to get back to even. It hurts to admit in the moment that you made a bad play, but cutting losses on all but your highest conviction plays is so important to preserving capital so when you make good trades you stand to make good gains. 

I found it helpful to reset after taking big losses in September and was able to run the $5k I had left up to 35k currently. Now Im trying to be disciplined about position sizing, making smart entries and taking profits on big run ups. Obviously its important to let winners run, but Ive been burned holding through a +80% spike only to watch the underlying sag for a week.

Start with very, very small positions of several stocks in different industries. Set stop losses and upper limits right away and stick with that.

12,"11/21/2021, 02:19:05",hleukso,Function_Initial,"Okay, so instead of picking the options willy nilly, youll look for expirations at least one week ahead, preferably two if you have the money under the unusual activity website. Ie pretend its 11/17, I would at least search for 11/26 dates. Under the columns you can organize it and Id do it by scrolling over to the right, choosing volume, then looking at what company it was - the theta decay (really wont touch anything higher than .4 whether its a put or call). From there I then open up my brokerage and I check the last five days of sales. I look at how the price of the stock is trending and how shorts+regular sales are being influenced versus buys.

An example is lets take action on peloton I used. I remember about 2.5m buys (or 250k sorry I forgot i went through a lot of analysis this week) 4.5m sales, and 3m shorts. This shows pretty damn heavy outflow. A good way to tell its shorted it look at the money by millions section and if there were a large ratio of sales to buys, and it is still green or not deep red, that theres a lot of shorts in. Indicating a further price drop. From there Id now analyze the next 4 business days. Checking the same exact fundamentals I indicated. Do not forget to check news. I bought puts because peloton went up to $54 when in two business days they were going to sell $1 billion shares at $46 to some hedge fund with an option for another $350 to be raised at $46. It had a paradoxical effect even the Dow Jones wrote made no sense. So I took this into consideration when I bought my puts along with knowing whats my pullout range

I really prefer like I said low theta decay options. Apple is fantastic. From 11-14 an 11-26 call had 0.04 theta decay. Next Ill go ahead and plug the trade into https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com. 

Itll show me for regular calls and puts what my EXTRINSIC value is only. It leaves out the intrinsic value. So you can just see simulated amounts indicating decay versus rises in price in the stock and the movement youll need to say, hold overnight versus sell. That way you understand how much of a price gain youd need solely to stay even or get more of a profit.

Now one thing Ill do if theres a tremendous number of calls or puts, or a price has dipped so low and has call options is buy cheap vertical spreads or debit spreads. Options finder has a part that you choose a price you believe stock will be by EOW or end of next week. Its up to you. I prefer my spreads to be weekly honestly. Youll then choose your maximum risk. Dont be a dunce and try not to risk more than you can tolerate. My personal risk tolerance is like 10% of my account (because I did really well the last week - I solely worked $800 keeping the rest aside thinking I was pulling out). I say 10% now because Im near $8700. And I own a stock and $1100 in calls that dipped a large amount. Theyll be worth a lot by their expiration in a month exactly. You could probably risk up to 20-25% if the options are at least 3 weeks out and give you a lot of time to react. 

Anyways, itll come up with a result such as for apple lets pretend I believe by EOW coming up the price has to drop down to 155 because resistance line was breached and I think itll retrace back - and theres huge put volume for 11/26, 12/3 and 12/10. I plugged in Im willing to lose 2k. 

Itll spit out something like this.

 Call credit spread (bearish): 55x 26th Nov 157.5/155 Call @ -$2.14
Entry cost: $11,770.00 (credit)
Maximum risk1: $1,980.00
Est. return1 at target price: $11,770.00 (594.4%)
Probability of profit: 23.4%.

Now I pay attention to the probability slightly but Ill admit ive seen it be absolutely wrong. I lost a full 290 on a company that it said 80% chance or something ridiculously high. 

These spreads are good as the losses are limited. Theta is almost irrelevant. And if the stock blows up or down you can buy it out early and get a decent chunk of your change.

IF SPREADS ARE NOT FOR YOU JUST REMEMBER. Find option with volume, if you see a stock you know well for whatever reason try that one. Or one that maybe you believe is overvalued and you see puts for 12-26 forroblox and you know its gained 37% in six business days - so you believe a pullback is due either due to inbound versus outbound sales+shorts versus buys or just a hunch. Then follow an option with a lot of volume to buy. The reason this is good is because with large amounts of volume tends to be bigger growth of the options premium sometimes even if the price isnt moving as fast in your direction as youd hope.

Thats about it! Just remember - my biggest trick is DONT feel rushed to buy an option. And always have a day trade available if you feel its a riskier option ie its a Friday and expires the following Friday. You dont want the price to explode or implode after the option purchase and have such little time to recover. If its a further option out, you can tolerate more risk. 

I hope this was a helpful explanation of some option ideas, calls and puts, and spreads and that this was explained okay! 

If its confusing let me know what parts and Ill try to write extra clarifying - then edit this initial post also! If its good as is, happy hunting and just know I turned around a huge loss Bc life happened in a very short period. So dont stress as all it takes is a good run and good picks. Dont be in a rush. If it feels awkward picking it trust your gut!

Last tip: dont shoot for the moon. Take profits. Remember 90% of people lose money in the stock market. Making 12-14% is considered a strong year. So if youre making 25-75% per option thats good! You dont need to hit a 1000% home run. I had $3750 in apple calls at 0.86 per which went to 8.20. I sold at 1.47 because I had 37 contracts and $1850 was large enough of a profit to make in a few hours of purchase. The apple car was not yet announced and the jump of apple was large that day.

GOOD LUCK AND LOOK FOR  but remember many options will not hit the moon - however theyll blast off. And blasting off can be good enough to bring a decent profit. 

Take care everyone and I hope this guide helps!",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy2h9m/insider_buying_mktw_update_1/hleukso/

Tell you what - in 1 year, you come back and show me how much you made. If we've suffered a global financial apocalypse and the world is in ruins, with GameStop as the new currency and reigning government, I will humbly admit defeat and offer you one of my children as tribute. 


Meanwhile, I made about $500 (?) on Gamestop way back when. Not a huge amount, but good enough for me. That's how I initially got interested, but now I just watch you all for baffled amusement; it's the way I look at flat earthers, Qanon fools, and the Scientologists. Fucking mental, and it's equal parts pathetic and astonishing. Like, you really don't understand how brainwashed you are. And I have to wonder if it's deliberate (do you really know, but refuse to admit it?) or if you're just THAT stupid and devoid of the ability to think critically or introspect at all?


I mean, ultimately it's not my problem, but you guys are like looking at bacteria through a microscope. Kinda fascinating at first, then boring and predictable, and now we just worry about you guys breaking containment and causing some issue. Just stick to your petri dish, and try to avoid contaminating everything around you with your stupid BS. And anytime a group tells you that listening to outside opinions will sow fear, doubt, and uncertainty and must be avoided at all costs - maybe consider that any decent thesis could and should be able to stand up to all scrutiny. If any differing opinion makes you lose ""faith"", your thesis is crap.

&amp;#x200B;

Defining a day trade  
When you buy and then sell the same stock or open and close the same options contract(s) within a single trading day, youve made a day trade.  
  
Understanding the rule  
Youll be considered a pattern day trader if you execute 4 or more day trades within 5 trading days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than 6% of your total trades within your margin account for that same 5 trading day period.

Ill hold at least that much there for the max 4% return to dampen the loan interest while I pay it off, will be an emergency fund while I pay off the loan, and to cover the full credit card statement balances.

Im using this primarily for a trip coming up that may cut into my the checking balance making me unable to pay off the statement balance on the credit card. Instead of 13.49% APR I use the loan money to cover whatever expenses I need for the trip.

Im using anything extra so Im able to max my ROTH for the year and I will pay off the loan within a couple of months sometime early next year. Once the trip is over and credit card balances are covered, Ill pay as much of the remaining balance of the loan, reducing the emergency fund for a couple months.

de March 2021 I've been carrying out the following steps:

1. only deal with options on big tech (mainly Amazon, one time with Google)

2. buy 1 call when Amazon has dropped around mid 3200s

3. if Amazon drops more keep buying more until I am fully yoloed

4. i only buy minimum 6-month options

5. if for te reason it depose even more I start moving option to higher strike 1 month closer to expiration

6.  cash out when Amazon surpasses 3500s

7.  repeat the process with Amazon puts if it hands around 3500+ for more than 2 to 3 weeks


so far it has worked

the long expiration helps and so does the stepping in slowly with one iron at a time

this also worked with Google options, which I tried once when Google dropped to 2700 (it then dropped further to 2600,scared the shit out of me but I held strong until 2950 and cashed out}

A new meme by Haupte? - Absolutely 

A box of chicken tenders with horsey sauce? - Guaranteed

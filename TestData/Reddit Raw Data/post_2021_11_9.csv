[Wholesale prices rise 8.6% year over year in October, tied for highest ever](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/wholesale-prices-rise-8point6percent-year-over-year-in-october-tied-for-highest-ever.html)

This is why we pay attention to the Economic Calendar. Input prices are certainly increasing. For those of you who dont know what they mean by wholesale prices, this is the price increase of bulk goods and services businesses use to make their end product or service. As to how bad this is  Ive never seen anything like this in my lifetime. Inflation data comes out tomorrow.  which will likely be amplified by todays Producer Price Index. Two of the big drivers were gasoline and the cost of autos. 

The big takeaway for today is that businesses are paying more for the wholesale goods they need to operate and this will likely be reflected in the CPI tomorrow. In short, the companies you are invested in will need to contend with higher input prices by increasing the cost of goods and services (or reinvesting to become more efficient) which will in turn result in the less people can afford to buy on a limited income. If this hits a tipping point where wages are increasing slowly with inflation increasing quickly, people with limited wages will be forced to buy their needs at higher prices and budget on the want side, resulting in less sales of goods people can go without.

Food for thought: To what extent does infrastructure spending help or not help the average worker (or the economy/markets for that matter) when it will result in the government competing for the same limited resources that people and businesses do, which will drive up prices? Its a good question! Its called crowding out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq6qgt/wholesale_prices_rise_86_year_over_year_in/

[Transglobe Energy](https://purplefloyd.substack.com/p/im-a-dirty-racoon-and-i-found-a-10bagger). 90% Increase

**March 9th ( $1.55 per share)  now trading at $2.95** **per share.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qnmacxfbcly71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b37db2c2248d7b1e8c55122e6a0934154f1101f7

&amp;#x200B;

Probably thought I was crazy buying this after a massive rallybut I dont look at charts when I invest. Technical analysis is astrology for men. I buy on price.

I released an analysis on oil shortly after researching this company, oil is now above $80 a barrel. I am still holding onto significant amounts of the company as I await their ratification with the Egyptian government to go through. The ratification, as described by their CEO, is going set to be ratified in Q4 this year.

The ratification will increase the amount of free cash the company receives by a LOT. At current prices, it will cause a major windfall and investors will reap the benefits. I do believe there is a small risk the deal will not go through, but it is a risk I am willing to take.

I am slightly nervous that oil prices can sustain this level, but the democrats in major countries are seemingly making it hard for oil not to rise even above these levels, and a cold winter coupled with an energy crisis around the world (plus associated inflation) leaves me comfortable with my position.

***Current position:*** **I have taken profits at highs, but still hold a major position as I await ratification.**

# [Uniti Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvsf03/uptick_in_onlyfans_registrations_good_news_for/) 20% increase

**March 2nd (UNITI $11.40 per share) now at $13.65**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5vh6nxqgcly71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4014c447bd2ad1240d4b707f47dd9c5cd25d854e

I sold out of UNITI mid-year when I stumbled into Frontier Communications. I moved all my UNITI into FYBR (Frontier) because they are in the same industry but I believed FYBR to be way more undervalued. More on FYBR later. Even so, there was still value left in UNITI. Unfortunately, I didnt share the upside.

***Current position:*** **Sold out at a loss as I moved into FYBR**

# [EzCorp](https://purplefloyd.substack.com/p/lets-go-slumming-ezcorp) 51% increase

**April 5th (WooWoo $5.16 per share) now $7.80 per share**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/56m7fqascly71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=954dc6760f98bb1483bea610cf9ab9592f92c715

I am still very fond of this company. When I found it lying low at the value I remember getting giddy once I started to understand the way their cash flows *actually* worked. Their financial statements were hard to decipher because their main business is in providing short-term loads. Management was also buying stock around $4-5 per share and I made sure to get my auditor buddy on a zoom call to make sure I was understanding the company properly (he is a master of accounting/accounting gimmicks). I had extremely high conviction about this company and wish I invested more into it.

***Current position:*** **Sold out at \~$8. The management is set on acquiring companies and I was hoping for buybacks**

# [Frontier Communications ](https://purplefloyd.substack.com/p/frontier-communications)28% increase

**May 28th (FYBR at $24.87 per share) now at $32.11**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h0pf5rktcly71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4913b3b93a217b2604dba220cde7598909d61b2

Frontier Communications was a darling find. They were rated the **worst** telecommunications company in the United States and even went bankrupt. I found them when they were emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. $11bn dollars of debt were wiped off the balance sheet and they had a great reputable new management team. Most importantly, half of their assets were fiber lines, and fiber lines in the United States are hot property right now. They just signed an agreement with AT&amp;T and I believe they are a prime take-over candidate.

***Current position:*** **I sold out out a portion of my FYBR when I read their new fresh accounting financial statements I believe the company, at current prices, maybe almost be fairly valued but I think their fiber assets still make them a good target for a take-over so I am holding a small amount of my original position.**

Inovio said it now has the authorization to proceed with the trial after 14 months, sending its shares up 4.6% before the bell.

The FDA last year in September put the final-stage trial on hold as it sought more information from the company, including details on a delivery device used to inject genetic material into cells.

Following the decision, the U.S. government pulled funding for the late-stage study for Inovio's vaccine as other COVID-19 vaccines were already available in the country.

Inovio then started late-stage trials outside the United States in partnership with China's Advaccine Biopharmaceuticals.

The company is currently conducting the Phase 3 portion of its mid-to-late-stage trial in several regions including Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq6kao/us_fda_lifts_clinical_hold_on_inovios_covid19/

Should people double down, or sell while they still can?",Mysteryisred,"Popular gaming platform Roblox (RBLX) rose 25% in the premarket today due to the companies report of increased player activity over the third quarter despite schools being back in session and the pandemic still going on. It rose to a peak of $103.58 (+34%) before falling off a little bit to $97.83 (+27%). As of writing this now, it is going back up to $100 and will probably end the day off at around $95-100 after all the wall street hype die down a little. 

This is all despite signs and concerns of inflation, a report of stock losses, and with kids having less time to play games due to school being back for most of the world. This begs the question, is this an actually good stock to invest in? Roblox has reported that their earnings and active player count has increased Q3 so who says that this won't happen Q4?

The CEO hinted that the stock priced in years of strong growth expectations before its initial public offering in 2020. For the rest of 2021, net revenue is constrained by global logistics and supply chain issues. Paul said the lack of affordable GPUs in the retail channel is hurting its business.

Corsair extended its product strength in performance and speed by introducing DDR5 memory on Oct. 27. Gamers often choose the Corsair brand first. Since the latest computer specifications will need DDR5, Corsairs Dominator Platinum and Vengeance DDR5 memory should lift revenue.

On November 2, Corsair Gaming reported earnings and showed a 21.6% year-over-year revenue growth despite the reopening of the economy and logistics issues!

Corsair, despite poor performance in the last quarter, has been improving its financial health. First, Corsair completed refinancing of $350 million. The refinancing decreased the interest rate from 4.75% to 1.25% reducing cash burn at about $2 million per quarter. Second, the company reported that it reduced the debt by about $24 million. 

In my opinion, this is a de-risked business to own. The stock price has been beaten down lately and most of the bad news is behind us. In my opinions, it only goes up from here!

For those interested in the short interest numbers, about 40+% of the float is shorted which makes no sense for a highly profitable business with little debt IMO.

CRSR just entered the monitor and facecam market and DDR5 revenues are coming! Big games are releasing this quarter which should boost CRSR's revenue.

Mods allow SPACs/deSPACs again + $HYLN over $1.5B MC = **REEEEEEEEEEEEE!**

Despite the depressing downtrend of virtually all SPACs/deSPACs this year, I still believe that $HYLN has potential to be a multi-bagger over the next few years.  As you probably know, $HYLN is transforming the class 8 long haul space with **CNG/RNG fueled trucks** but also have a **roadmap to hydrogen units**. Thats right, hydrogen too! Sort of like $NKLA and $HYZN but with fuel agnostic solutions (gravity is not a fuel source) and without fraud allegations.

https://preview.redd.it/m8s41j340ly71.jpg?width=543&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc2297cf2e4b6b5fa169f9eae3d57e310704c395

However, because the feasibility of hydrogen infrastructure reliance is at best a few years away, and fleets are looking to start the green transition now, $HYLN is pouncing to grab that first mover advantage and **leveraging the existing natural gas infrastructure today**. The current CNG/RNG option fuels the **HyperTruck ERX up to 1,000 miles** with a very short refueling time, no long down time charging batteries. No alt energy competitor, not electric based $TSLA, not hydrogen based $NKLA &amp; $HYZN or *insert your EV SPAC bags here* can match this range not yet anyway. The long haul space is all about keeping trucks on the road as long as possible and as cheaply as possible, $HYLN does that. And thats why some of the largest fleets in the country, **Agility Logistics, American Natural Gas, Anheuser-Busch, GreenPath Logistics, NFI, Penske Truck Leasing, Ruan Transportation Management Systems, Ryder System, Inc., Schneider, Wegmans Food Markets, Werner Enterprises**, are all working with $HYLN.  These fleets are investing their time in the **\[HyperTruck Innovation Council\] (**[**https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210407005508/en/Hyliion-Forms-Hypertruck-Innovation-Council-to-Advance-Electrification-Solutions-for-Commercial-Transportation-Industry**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210407005508/en/Hyliion-Forms-Hypertruck-Innovation-Council-to-Advance-Electrification-Solutions-for-Commercial-Transportation-Industry) to ensure that $HYLN products are designed and developed with their constraints and needs in mind. These guys aren't wasting their time, they want and need to start the transition to greener fleets asap. If you know anything about the natural cycle of fleet management, fleets turn over every 4-6 years and then the trucks are sold in a secondary market. This means that if a fleet wants to be fully green in 4-6 years they need to start the rotation today. With that said, these fleets represent over **100K trucks** and converting just a fraction of these trucks each year is enough for $HYLN to reach its revenue forecasts, always a legitimate concern for pre-revenue investors.

*So what about those sales, I dont see them?*

Piss off, $HYLN is a pre-revenue company, we all know this. Even their own forecasts for 2021 are immaterial ($8M). But they start to ramp up significantly in 2022. Although they are likely to fall short of their 2021 targets, they have stated many times they **will be booking revenue in 2021**, can't say that for many of these pre-rev companies. Regardless, you should be **investing for the growth story** here not the current fundamentals. Missing those insignificant 2021 sales mean nothing under virtually any valuation model.  But if they drastically miss targets in 2-3 years then it becomes a real issue. So with that said, lets take a look at the forecasts from the investor presentation.

https://preview.redd.it/b5esizh80ly71.jpg?width=559&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed12609ec5b7d0f6e2cfa83afc06fe55f8d28f7d

[*Source: INVESTOR PRESENTATION*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm)

With these forecasts we can start to run valuation models, nerds bums r wet right now. For example, we can take their EBITDA projections to build out a valuation model that focuses on operating profitable, aka corporate tendies. Accounting 101, EBITDA is basically net income before adjusting for other items such as interest payments, taxes and depreciation/amortization. However, the crux of the EBITDA models are the assumptions, notably the EBITDA multiple and discount rate.

Lets start with the EBITDA multiple, its not a exact science and to complicate things there really isnt any obvious direct competitor to pull comparable data. $HYLN is sort of a truck manufacturer and sort of a disruptive tech company. Data on US Class 8 truck sales shows that Freightliner (Daimler), Kenworth (PACCAR) and Peterbilt (PACCAR) are the three largest manufacturers, and account for roughly 2/3 of all sales. We will use theses as proxy manufacturers comps.

[Source: STATISTA](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245369/cloass-8-truck-sales-by-manfuacturer/)

But, as I mentioned, they are also sort of a disruptive tech company too. I dont want to compare them to $TSLA, they are in their own class. But its worth looking at $TSLAs EBITDA multiple to get some perspective of disruptive tech valuations. Below are the EBITDA multiples 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wr0up07e0ly71.jpg?width=297&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d75856dd5cfbd198da4485da4f8bebc562bb50

[*Source : FINBOX* ](https://finbox.com/OTCPK:DMLR.Y/explorer/ev_to_ebitda_ltm)

We can see that these EV/EBITDA multiples are fairly stable for both Daimler and PACCAR, but spike in 2020. This spike is, at least partially, due to the economic shock of the pandemic, EBITDA shrunk at a faster rate than enterprise value. Therefore, to be conservative, Ill use the median EV/EBITDA multiples from 2016 to 2020 to help remove that noise. These **median ratios are 11.3x and 10.8x**, pretty close to each other. On the other hand, $TSLAs multiples are very volatile, largely because its has been a growth story (less EBTIDA during growth phase) and has experienced wild stock price swings, so Im not even going to provided that chart but, just for perspective, the LTM (Last Twelve Month) EBITDA multiple currently sits at **169.9x**.  $TSLA shorts r fuk

Sensitivity analysis with different multiples can help us assess enterprise value and stock price under different assumptions. Ill use a 10X multiple as a proxy for direct manufacturer (Daimler and PACCAR comps), 15X to add a little disruptive/growth story value and 30X to add even more. That being said, IMO, 15X seems to be a fair. And because $HYLN basically has no debt and the cash it has will be allocated to burn to bring products to market, Ill consider enterprise value = market cap for this analysis. This is an oversimplification but as youve seen even the selection of multiples are up for interpretation so lets just keep it simple for the smooth brains.

In addition, I will be very conservative and use a discount rate of 25% which accounts for not only increasing rates, iNFlaTioN Is TRanSiTorY, but a significant risk premium as $HYLN tries to carve out a new market. For context, discount rates are generally in the range of 10-20%.

The first valuation model is the **BULL CASE** which assumes $HYLN actually meets their 2024 projections, this doesnt even consider the potential to surpass them. We can take their 2024 EBITDA, markup the terminal value with the multiple and discount back three years at 25%. This gives a stock price range of **$17.81 to $53.43 today**, depending on which multiple you believe is most comparable. Again, IMO the 15X is appropriate and results in a share price of $26.72 today, hence my JAN2022 20c, RIP.  Keep in mind this is only accounting for the first three years of growth and this is a growth story. If year 2025 and 2026 growth out paces the discount rate effect it would add more present value  (PV) to the market cap. But Im not going to enter the echo chamber and create my own bullish forecasts to 2026, a typical five year forecast. I decided to conservatively stick with these short term growth prospects effectively capping these valuations.

*Ok ok, but those are $HYLNs own forecasts, come on man they are pumping the stock! REEEEEEE!*

Ugh, youre still reading this Vyvanse induced babble? Ok fine, so lets make a **BEAR CASE** that $HYLN only achieves 2/3 of their forecasted revenue. Holding all other assumptions constant, our range dips to **$11.88 to $35.64**, about 30% to 400% higher than the closing stock price Monday.

*Me no like math, me smooth brain!*

Correct and you smol pp too. Anyway, forecasts are nice but lets explore how they might achieve them. As mentioned, dont underestimate the value of having 100K trucks represented in the HyperTruck Innovation Council, expect some firm sales at some point. If $HYLN can prove their solution works, this council alone could fill the 19K ERX forecasts in 2024 as they naturally turn over their fleets. On top that, there are several publicly known non-binding reservation. For example, [**American Natural Gas**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201015005658/en/Hyliion-Announces-Natural-Gas-Fueling-Partnership-with-American-Natural-Gas) and [**Detmar Logistics**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005269/en/Detmar-Logistics-Reserves-300-Hyliion-Hypertruck-ERX%E2%84%A2-Units-Expanding-Fleet-Electrification-Collaboration)  both have locked in their early interest and are likely convert to firm sales. On that note, I wouldnt be surprised to hear about more reservations at ER this week. Or, at the latest, end of year as $HYLN is currently on their [**Nationwide Hypertruck ERX roadshow**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211105005238/en/ADDING-MULTIMEDIA-Hyliion-Announces-Nationwide-Hypertruck-ERX-Marketing-Roadshow-Kickoff) marketing the ERX demo units first hand. However, I think the political connections at $HYLN is the real sleeper. Elaine Chao, the former Secretary of Transportation and wife of Mitch McConnell, current Senate Minority Leader, is on the $HYLN board. Politicians are greasy weasels by nature, dont be shocked when strings are pulled and back room deals are made to toss some contract scraps at $HYLN.**Connections = Contracts**. Even more evidence is that $HYLN was brought public by Tortoise Acquisition, who clearly played the long game and strategically planted Mitch as their turtle in the Senate. #FACTS

Some things I am watching for at ER and beyond are obviously the aforementioned reservation and sales number, the stock isnt going anywhere without these. But even without those, share accumulation is likely to play a big role in the short term price action. Many of the bag holders have capitalized on the dip to average down. Additionally, institutions such as BlackRock significantly increased their holdings last quarter. With 13-Fs coming out shortly, more institutional buying will be a very bullish signal. Looking at the charts, we see a quadruple bottom that was defended, this is a key range of accumulation. Just now we are starting to see a break out of the downward channel. If this upward movement continues it has space to run IMO. On every dip the rocket fueled up the tanks, and this bish is loaded for Jupiter. Additionally, $HYLN also has a reasonably high short interest, yahoo finance has it 20.6% as of Oct 14. Thats about 9-10 days to cover those shorts on average volume. Therefore, if $HYLN releases new information at ER, Wegmans Demo day includes a sales announcement or the potential Rivian IPO madness bleeds into the EV sector this could snowball into a parabolic short term move.

Theyve been around for 20yrs (according to their website)

Hydrogen might not work w vehicles, being less efficient that pure battery electric vehicles bc you lose energy when you convert water in to hydrogen and then again when you convert hydrogen to electricity + water.

However, it might be economically legitimate on large long distances semis, airplanes, heavy machinery, ferries, ships, and stuff like that- you can store a ton of it, and your vehicle gets lighter the longer you drive, improving fuel economy. A battery stays the same weight the whole time, and has to be really big in a semi.

So it seems there could be a niche market for hydrogen in general, if not a breakout huge market.

Blue orca alleged that HYZON is faking some stuff, and their stock price cut in half. 

Its been sitting low, even after they responded to the short seller report, maybe in part bc there is lingering news about a class action lawsuit brought on by that report.

And it seems to me that they truly to have proprietary technology. In addition, they already have trucks they can sell, and if Im not mistaken, have sold.

However, due to the structure of its business, it is extremely hard for PLTR to show vast improvements in revenue on QoQ basis. Their  contracts are spread our over many years and sometimes not even a cent from the potential revenue from deals signed in the current quarter is being accounted for in their most recent financial reports. When evaluating a company like PLTR on QoQ basis, there are numerous metrics that are more important than simply revenue growth and as It turns out they are doing amazing and their fundamentals are constantly improving.

First of all, their revenue from the government segment is up more than 30 percent YoY, while some analyst were even predicting that it would rapidly deaccelarate. They signed some major deals this quarter and confirmed that they were chosen as the sole provider for the army's 823m contract.

When it comes to commercial growth, the numbers look even better. They managed to acquire a record breaking 32 new net commercial  customers in this quarter, compared to 20 in the previous(see rev.growth is not everything). Their U.S commercial revenue was up 104 percent, compared to 90 in q3, their international commercial revenue also grew and their total commercial outstanding deal value is up 101 percent on YoY basis. They also again announced some mojor new customers by name and one of them was Kinder Morgan. Remember that commercial growth and scalability of their software is the main concern that WS analyst express about PLTR.

Finally, let's take a look at some financial metrics that WSB mainly does not care about, but WS does. Their FCF is constantly improving even on a quarterly basis and YoY is up by some insane percentage, I believe it was over 800. Their operating expenses are down 40 percent for the quarter and their operating margins continue to increase. They also raised their guidance for the next quarter and expect their average revenue per customer to  became even bigger in the future.

PS: This is not an investment advice, obviously. I am a PLTR bull, but even I think that 40 percent YoY growth might be a bit slow for a company as generously valued as PLTR, but anyways most PLTR investors are beting on the fact that the company will sustain this levels for many years and even improve on them. If you want big results right now, it is probably better to look elsewhere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq4sa6/palantirs_fundamentals_are_getting_better_every/

BNTX had another banger quarter, while Moderna missed. What does that mean? 

BNTX/Pfizer vaccine has established itself as a preferred vaccine, both in US and more importantly abroad. I have some relatives abroad and when talking to them, it seems they want the pfizer vaccine, even tho other vaccines are already available in that region. This bodes well for both initial inoculation and later booster shots. Being approved for use in children also adds a layer to this.

And having established itself as a preferred shot, I think they will continue to take market share from competitors both domestically and globally, and that's exactly what these latest contrasting earnings for both Moderna and BNTX are suggesting to me. This company has room to grow still.

1,"11/09/2021, 22:17:32",I turned myself into a cartoon to expose fraud.,Matador3364,"I have spent the past 10 months digging into Kenneth Griffin, of Citadel LLC, and have publicly written over a 100 pages discussing my journey doing so. During this journey, I discovered, with tangible mathematical proof, that Kenneth Griffin is operating the United States Government Trading Markets, and other Art and Collectors Markets, as an International Ponzi Scheme. I have uploaded audio versions of my journey onto my SoundCloud here: https://soundcloud.com/matador33

As of right now, I am one of, if not the number one, leading edge artists in the NFT market because of this. In the world. The amount of public support I have for this just continues to grow.



I also sent two pitchforks by mail to Kenneth Griffin so that he is aware of me.



And I renounced all United States Government's Claims of Authority and Laws from applying to me.



Along with all other Authoritative Bodies that exist in the World.



I am the only one who can do this, because this is a solo art project that I own.



I have also posted my personal address online, and have publicly told Kenneth Griffin to come send someone to harm me, because I am not afraid of him.



This shit is way bigger than me.



My argument is, I'm allowed to do this, and anything I want to because:



I reached out to my elected officials on this issue starting in February. I have not had a single reply.

I have reached out to the SEC, FTC, FBI, FINRA, and other regulatory agencies about these issues over the course of this project. I have not had a single reply.

I have publicly declared that I am playing an Alternate Reality Game. You can't get arrested and charged for shooting someone in a video game like Grand Theft Auto 5. I can't get arrested or charged for anything I do while playing my ARG Game (I have metaphorically removed my consciousness and being into a different reality, like I said, it's philosophical, but it's all based on sound logic).

I have been insanely open about this since the start of the project. I have publicly told the SEC, etc. that I would do this if they did not get involved. Everything, from my thought processes, to decisions I thought I'd have to make, all posted online, it's all posted online. And has been going on for months, and no one has officially told me I have had to stop, so I think that warrants precedent that it is okay to continue to do so.

(This art project is a statement on the unfair access of information and education for the poor vs. the wealthy, along with just broader wealth gap issues in general. It IS an art project, first and foremost).



Some of those posts have been removed, or have had expected paid bad actors post comments and messages to try to discredit my character. I have so much evidence of this. I am still being handed more on a plate as I type out this letter. There is a lot of speculative evidence that Ken Griffin bankrolls this to happen, not just to me, but millions of people who have actually intelligent things to say online.



The media portrayal of me as a ""dumb money investor"" shows that the media, and as an extension society, does not have my best interest in mind. So I must do what is best for me, as an individual.



I publicly posted this project on reddit, in their r Art community. In it, I stated the universe was my medium. Posting online is an action that facilitates copyrights for the artist or author posting online. If I own the universe, I own the rules.



I have put an insane amount of thought into this.



This is going to upend the legal world, and the entire rest of the world. This is Michael Burry shit times 1,000.



My next step in this Game is to wait for Ken Griffin to sue me, or for me to get arrested.



If I go to court, all of his evidence goes to court.



I purposely built this fail safe. He is tied to me in this. And I want him in prison, honestly, I want him charged with treason at the highest level. I spent 10 months digging into this man's life. Please, hear me out before you think I am being too severe.



The narrative of the case that I am building is this:

I have the right to express my art in my choosing, and

As an artist I also get to claim the profits from my sales, even subsequent ones.

Why don't I get royalties? If a rich hedge fund owner buys my work, and then turns around and sells it for 100x the price, why do they get to profit from my work? You need to understand that, while that has not personally happened to me, it is happening to the art world as a whole. And I take it very personally.



I am also claiming that Kenneth Griffin is negatively affecting the price of the NFTs tied to this project, because of his manipulation in the markets, and in the subreddit forums I post in.



Those are three of the biggest issues I want to address if this goes to court.



How many video games and cartoons make fun of famous people? That is what I am right now, at least in the eyes of the law, and I have 100 pages of proof of how and why I can claim that. My life, legally, has, metaphorically, become a cartoon.



I have put a lot of thought into this, guys.



I also refuse to accept a single penny of profit from the artwork I have tied this all to. I've already publicly declared that I have tied contracts to them, and those contracts state I must donate all the money from them to specific non-profit organizations. This is a matter of principle for me.



If you think I am just being crazy, please, fucking tell me. I have been begging people to disprove my argument for months. No one has been able to yet. This art project has been seen by thousands.



I have full belief in my ability to win this case.



I have faith in the people, some who have watched me take all the steps to do this since January, 2021, to agree with my statements on all these issues, publicly.



*****



To try to clear it up as simple as possible:



I made an online investigative journalist report, that I intend to turn into a full book, that also coincides with the implementation and creation of multiple Alternate Reality Games and Performance Arts, all backed by multiple NFTs. (Non-fungible tokens - Online Artworks backed by Blockchain Technology)



I did this to legally protect myself while manipulating the stock market away from Kenneth Griffin.



Every single layer to this is Art.



This is no different than Hunter S. Thompson.



This is no different than Joaquin Phoenix in I'm Still Here.



I just have more layers of protection, because I have multiple layers of art.



To make it overly clear:



I am declaring my life an art project. Anything I do is a part of that art project, so I am protected under my First Amendment Right of The U.S. Constitution, which I also believe is an unalienable Right that transcends all countries and borders. This is unarguable.



I also own the proprietary rights on this art project. Which means no one else can make the claims I am. This is to protect from future people trying to do the same as me. This is dangerous territory I am adventuring into. I do not want people to follow me.



My claims are:



I have proprietary ownership of the collective human hivemind (This is so I can sue, or hold accountable in any other way, any company that creates fake online bot accounts for the purpose of civil unrest or discontent in the future).



I have proprietary ownership of the space-time continuum that exists after Tuesday, November 9th, 2021, until I say otherwise. (This is the moment I am claiming I ""moved my piece"" in the Game. It is the moment I sent Kenneth Griffin two pitchforks using the entire world's centralized economies, and I am claiming this action changed the forward motion of the universe, down a completely different path than what it was) (I wrote 21 pages explaining why I can claim this, The Divine Joys of Poking a Bear audio covers it) (This is what gives my Logistical NFT it's tangible worth).



These two claims are also backed by an NFT that I announced I would be minting, which I also appraised to be worth $147 Trillion. I plan to fractionalize this, 147 Trillion times, and sell it at a penny each, to raise $1.4 Trillion dollars for world hunger and homelessness.



I have publicly stated constantly that this is all an art performance, none of this advocates violence, and it is strictly an investigative and sociological look into the Cultural and Socio-Economic issues facing my life as an artist today.



I have also unequivocally denied being a part of any other affiliations or groups, whether Political, Financial, or Religious (I get accused of this kind of stuff the most, and as I explained above, I think it's a discredit tactic put onto reddit either directly or indirectly by Kenneth Griffin).



This isn't something that is a political issue, it gets solved in the courts.



It gets solved by the people.



We get to make the new laws. We get to build a better world for everyone.



Together.

These were the types of comments I was getting on my artwork, for months, before having my ability to post on reddit clearly be manipulated, and brigaded by user accounts that do not facilitate positive discussion on this issue.



""This needs so much more attention than it's getting.

It's really fucking fantastic.""



""I couldn't stop reading. Thank you.""



""This is fucking glorious.""



""Matador,

Thank you. I felt every word you wrote in this letter. I have an overwhelming sense of emotion after completing the read that I just cant describe. I am not fucking alone in this and I cant stop crying because for so long I have felt alone. You have helped connect so many dots over the last year I couldnt help but think at times I was absolutely crazy, brainwashed, or just stupid for believing internet strangers This was what I needed this morning. I needed to read every word of those beautifully written 21 pages. I hope Kenneth does too.""



""Holy shit that gave me chills. Thank you for taking the time to make this. I hope as many see it as possible. I don't have a single ounce of the skill you have with words, I literally don't think I have it in me to describe how this made me feel. Thank you sir, you truly are an artist.""



""I will leave this here for legal purposes. I do believe that what you created was art. It exists as a type of mimicry that speaks for reality. As they say, art mimics reality, and reality mimics art. You are blessed to have figured this out. Your strength of will is a blessing to us.""



As proof that I have been public and open about this, I am showing a comment I made during The First Hypothetical ARG Experience I held. I publicly posted this comment on July 31st, 2021:



""The issue with the NFT play is that it requires that last buy/sale price to set market value for collateral.



Or it requires proving to the Civil Admins that the market value is being tampered with, which damages that NFTs ability to get fair value, leaving the Shadow Users potentially on the hook for the potential price of the NFT, if the Civil Admins side with the Player.



It's wild west as fuck.""

1,"11/09/2021, 21:21:32",Virgin Galactic - The Ultimate Growth Stock,MoonrakerRocket,"**Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the worlds first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company.** It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Heres a brief overview.

# WHAT DO THEY DO?

Virgin Galactic operate in commercial **sub-orbital tourism and scientific research,** and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming **the first company in history to take a private citizen into space.** The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions.

The company uses a **unique method of flight into space,** with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company.

The customer will be given a **multi-day experience**, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to **the companys announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus** during 2021Q2s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 **announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this** as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the **recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO,** to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.**Other management and board members include figures from **Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM.**

Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures *(formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites),* the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaleds acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TheSpaceshipCompany was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company **vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems.**

In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. **The company was wrongly criticised at the time** for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the crafts aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme.

VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This **additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs** following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Bransons notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. **The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity.** Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. **While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track.**  
The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. **The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile.**

In March 2021 the **company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine.** Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed *(with 85% of the components being fabricated),* and previous earnings calls outline a desire to **expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years.** However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; **providing increased cabin capacity and altitude.** This new design is aimed at **scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes** due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, **the company is also investing in a new Design &amp; Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production.**  
VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspires completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected.

There is perhaps **room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft,** as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgins original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open.

In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below.

# BACKERS AND CONSUMERS

Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include **Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAEs capital.** An significant indirect investment comes from **the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America**, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through **ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiyas Social Capital** and has since received strong institutional and retail backing.

As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its **collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, Overture, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe** which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.**Virgin Galactic holds **purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage,** and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is **expected to rollout in 2025**before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts **Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes** compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use.

Further relating to Virgin Galactics hypersonic aspirations, **the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce** relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that **The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation,** meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft.

Notable relationships include **Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public**, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. **Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceships seating,** and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.**The company has also fostered **relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads** as part of the Flight Opportunities programme.

The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. **Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government** and the opportunity for **potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan.**

# FINANCIALS &amp; VALUATION

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that **the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T**. Additionally, in 2018 Bain &amp; Company show that **spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%**. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an **elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business.** The company has also demonstrated its **highly selective customer process** for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000.

The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, **having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays.** Currently tickets cost $450,000 *(up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight),* and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - **generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight.** After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, **the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest.**  
The company also functions in both **private and government research sectors**, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. **This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight.** Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate **$1B annually per spaceport** from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships.

The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughl**y $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale**, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand.

In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the markets biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. **Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19.**  
Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.

1,"11/09/2021, 21:14:08",Virgin Galactic - The Ultimate Growth Stock,MoonrakerRocket,"**Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the worlds first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company.** It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Heres a brief overview.   


# WHAT DO THEY DO?

Virgin Galactic operate in commercial **sub-orbital tourism and scientific research,** and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming **the first company in history to take a private citizen into space.** The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions.   


The company uses a **unique method of flight into space,** with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company.   


The customer will be given a **multi-day experience**, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to **the companys announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus** during 2021Q2s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 **announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this** as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the **recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO,** to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.** Other management and board members include figures from **Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM.**  


Following the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures *(formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites),* the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaleds acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company **vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems.**  


In its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. **The company was wrongly criticised at the time** for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the crafts aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme.   


VSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This **additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs** following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Bransons notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. **The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity.** Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. **While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track.**   
The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. **The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile.**  


In March 2021 the **company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine.** Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed *(with 85% of the components being fabricated),* and previous earnings calls outline a desire to **expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years.** However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; **providing increased cabin capacity and altitude.** This new design is aimed at **scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes** due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, **the company is also investing in a new Design &amp; Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production.**  
VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspires completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected.   


There is perhaps **room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft,** as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgins original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open.   


In the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,** detailed further below.   


# BACKERS AND CONSUMERS

Unsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include **Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAEs capital.** An significant indirect investment comes from **the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America**, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through **ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiyas Social Capital** and has since received strong institutional and retail backing.  


As previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its **collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, Overture, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe** which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be **operational by 2029.** Virgin Galactic holds **purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage,** and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is **expected to rollout in 2025** before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts **Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes** compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use.  


Further relating to Virgin Galactics hypersonic aspirations, **the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce** relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that **The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation,** meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft.  


Notable relationships include **Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public**, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. **Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceships seating,** and the company also **collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.** The company has also fostered **relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads** as part of the Flight Opportunities programme.   


The company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. **Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government** and the opportunity for **potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan.**   


# FINANCIALS &amp; VALUATION

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that **the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T**. Additionally, in 2018 Bain &amp; Company show that **spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%**. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an **elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business.** The company has also demonstrated its **highly selective customer process** for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000.   


The company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, **having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays.** Currently tickets cost $450,000 *(up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight),* and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - **generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight.** After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, **the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest.**  
The company also functions in both **private and government research sectors**, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. **This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight.** Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate **$1B annually per spaceport** from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships.  


The company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughl**y $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale**, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand.    


In my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the markets biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. **Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19.**  
Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.

# [Dow futures edge lower after new highs; GE jumps on news it will split into 3 companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/stock-us-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were mixed during early trading Tuesday after the major averages closed at records, boosted by strength in infrastructure stocks.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 21 points. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded in mildly positive territory.
*****
&gt; Shares of GE rallied after CNBCs David Faber reported that the legendary company would be splitting into three companies focusing on aviation, healthcare and energy. The stock soared more than 12% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; During Monday regular trading all three major averages rose to new highs. The Dow gained about 104 points, or 0.29%, posting its 44th record close of the year. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.09% and closed above 4,700 for the first time. The move pushed the broad equity index to its 64th record close of 2021. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.07% to post its 11th straight positive session, the longest daily winning streak since December 2019. The tech-heavy index registered its 44th record close of 2021.
*****
&gt; Key inflation data will be reported this week, with the producer price index, which measures the costs of final-demand manufactured goods, reading coming on Tuesday, followed by the consumer price index on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting producer prices to have risen 0.6% month over month in October. The consumer price index is also expected to show a 0.6% jump compared to the prior month.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares turned higher in premarket trading, a day after falling nearly 5% when company founder Elon Musk asked Twitter users whether he should sell 10% of his stock. The stock was up 1.2% Tuesday morning.
*****
&gt; Popular trading app Robinhood saw its shares lose more than 3% premarket following disclosures that a third party made off with names and email addresses of a few million users and was able to get personal information on about 300 of those users.
*****
&gt; NVIDIA shares rose nearly 5% premarket after the company said it was joining forces with several self-driving sensor companies on safety systems that automakers will be able to deploy as soon as 2024.
*****
&gt; Infrastructure-related stocks were among Mondays biggest winners after the House passed the spending package on Friday evening. Materials was the top-performing S&amp;P group, rising 1.23%, while the industrials sector closed at a record.
*****
&gt; The passing of the traditional infrastructure bill is a strong positive for the economy and for markets, as it should result in positive ROI [return on investment] for the country, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
&gt; Infrastructure is one of those expenditures which is truly an investment  with an expected positive return on money spent  as opposed to a pure expense, with relatively little chance of getting the money back, he added.
*****
&gt; Strong earnings results have also supported stocks in running to new highs. Through Monday morning 445 S&amp;P 500 components have reported quarterly results, with 81% beating earnings estimates. When it comes to revenue, 76% of companies have exceeded expectations.
*****
&gt; The bulk of the index may have reported, but there are still some widely-watched reports on deck. D. R. Horton will report before Tuesdays opening well, while Wynn Resorts and Coinbase will provide updates when the market closes.
*****
&gt; With Q3 earnings season winding down, economic data and the progress in economic re-openings will gain in importance in investors focus from here to the end of the year, noted John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management.
*****
&gt; Also on Monday, Federal Reserve Governor Randal Quarles, who served a dual role as banking system supervisor, announced he would be stepping down around the end of 2021. Multiple Fed officials spoke Monday, with Vice Chairman Richard Clarida expressing concern about inflation, the current pace of which is much more than a moderate overshoot of the Feds 2% goal.
*****
&gt; In another central bank development, President Joe Biden last week interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard for the position of Fed chairman, Bloomberg News reported, a surprise development in that most of Wall Street expects Jerome Powell to be renominated to the position.

1,"11/09/2021, 21:01:25","The bottom is in for LG Display. Heavily Undervalued, will easily rally 15% by EOY",sell-my-information,"LG Display is a Korean company and one of the world's largest manufacturers of TFT-LCD and OLED screens for IT devices, computers, mobile devices, and TVs. For the past two years, they've fallen on less than optimal times with the increase in raw material costs and shipping restraints limiting growth during covid. During this time, LG invested in new factories in Vietnam and Research and Development on novel computer interfaces for tech like electric vehicles and smart wearables. 2021 has finally seen their investments in the past previous years pay off and are earning more revenue than ever. For Q2 and Q3 this year they have beat expectations on earnings. **THE BOTTOM IS IN.**

Here's the interesting part about it For such a well-known tech company, ***LG Display's current market cap is only around $6bil giving them a forward P/E ratio of around 4.53 and a P/S ratio of less than 7***. How the fuck do these numbers make any sense given their market dominance of over 50% and balance sheet? This stock is literally trading at 7x sales when everyone else in this space is trading at 20-60. 

# BULL: LG Display is Undervalued and Due for a Rally With OLED Growth

Q4 is about to be amazing for LG display riding off the back of higher shipping volumes during this holiday season. That's just the beginning of the overall rising volume and demand for OLED displays.

""**Panel shipments in the fourth quarter are expected to increase by mid-10% compared to the third quarter**, with the delayed shipments affected by the industrys component shortage ...while the prices of LCD TV panels are expected to remain on a downward trend,"" LG Display said in a statement.  

## Quarterly OLED Panel Shipments by Application, 2020-2021

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5g8ne47fhky71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7a73e2a785a167d88644731910fab952b4bb818

Although smartphones make up about  of OLED panel shipments in unit terms, shipments in other applications are showing even more impressive growth. Panels for game systems, in particular the Nintendo Switch, are growing from nothing in 2020 to 4.8M in the second half of 2021. Notebook panel shipments are expected to grow by 550% Y/Y to 3.3M units in the second half, and shipments of OLED panels for smartphone subdisplays are expected to grow 303% Y/Y as they are increasingly important for foldable smartphones.  

***LG Display is priced like a value stock given their current performance metrics. It seems the market has not taken into account OLED growth. I see virtually zero downside at today's price but has huge gain potentials.***

Leading tech stocks showed mixed performance, with chip stocks outperforming the market indexes and infrastructure ETFs posting records. The Congress passed the $1 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, bringing $550 billion new investments in transportation and broadband among other sectors. The travel ban towards 33 countries including the U.K. and other most European countries was lifted. Most sectors led by energy and materials boosted the better performance of US stocks.  Attention still goes to laggard plays of leading industrial stocks and the trend of leading basic materials stocks. Chip, software and cloud stocks face corrections at any time based on the recent huge hikes, therefore they are not suitable to buy in at higher prices, but to lock in profits.

$XPDI has SIGNFICANTLY more upside than $RIOT $HUT and $MARA. The full red pill is here:

[https://twitter.com/kingtutspacs/status/1445786805861642244](https://twitter.com/kingtutspacs/status/1445786805861642244)

Currently the biggest bcorn miner in North America BY FAR.

By end of 2022, they will have have a hash rate (how much bcorn they can mine) of 31 Exxahash vs marathon at 10.4 and Riot at 9

By year end they will have 512 MW of Power vs Riot at 300 and Marathon at 115

Marathon and Riot rent their power/miners from Core.

Riot is trading at 6.5x 2022 EV/Revenue

Marathon at 8x 2022 EV/Revenue

XPDI is trading at 4.5x

The reason no one knows $XPDI yet is that they are SPAC and the deal hasn't closed yet. But, there is NO PIPE. So investors don't need to worry about getting dumped on by Pipe sellers after unlock

That obscene 4.5x EV/Revenue number is BASED ON A 30,000 BCORN PROJECTION. To be conservative thats the number they gave in their deck for the average price of bcorn in 2022. Which means its really trading in 2s. Just absurd. Havent seen a better buy than this in my entire life. Just to trade in line with peers its a 3 bagger. But it deserves a massive premium.

1) Make sure the ad is shown (not behind a window etc)

2) Detect bots and don't lose impressions to fraud  
3) Analyze the page ad is shown on semantically for brand safety and targeting

This is a strongly growing market. Major advertisers want this type of solution that preferably serves them across all geographies and platforms. That's why DV has offices all over and keeps adding new platforms, such as recently TikTok. The advertisers don't want a platform provider to do this verification themselves, so e.g. Google stepping in and taking over the market is not likely. 

DV has very strong tech - I sold them some from Finland.

DV' has been following ""rule of 60"", with revenue growth % + ebitda % being greater than 60. 

It IPOed in April at $36, and has been as high as $48. Last night closed at $33.7. Third quarter financials coming today after market close.

1,"11/09/2021, 16:31:54",GENC: 70 % cash per share and direct benefit from infra bill,zacchier,"Hi everybody,

I have been long following Gencor Industries (GENC). It has been quite stable stock due to high insider ownership and low trading volume. However fundamentals are rock solid and they are now directly benefitting from recent US infrastructure bill that has been passed in early November. **Stock is currently trading at 12,35 USD per share.**

Their numbers are for most recent 9 months ended:

\- 14,62 million shares outstanding

\- Net income per share 0,42 USD

\- Assets 181,27 million = 12,40 USD per share

\- Debt 13,82 million = 0,95 USD per share, therefore **no net debt**

**- Net assets per share 11,45 USD per share**

If we take away cash and liquid securities (122,88 million = 8,41 USD per share), the whole operation and assets are valued at 3,94 USD per share = **P/E of 9,34.**

Now that infra bill has been passed GENC is expected to make some serious progress in next 12 months. 

I am long GENC.

In the wake of Deciphera dropping by ~70% last week, I was poking around the news and saw that Cogent Bioscences was mentioned in the same breath in at least one report (in that Decipheras trial failure could be opening the door for Cogents success in same type of trial, and that their price target was being upgraded).

Its a tiny company (15 employees?), but a Buy rating with a target of $15 - $31 in the next 12 months currently sitting at $8.80 last close.  52 week high was $13.90.

Earnings is due out 11/9.

Is there anything here you think?  I figured Id pick up a handful of cheap 12/17 $10 calls at .45 cents each today, even though the odds seem slim?

1,"11/09/2021, 16:03:41",Just how rigged is this game?,burgerboy18,"Thinking about insider trading and Congress. 

This is an example. For it, were going to use XOMs cash on hand value. 

Now lets say theres a huge bill going around thats creating a fuss in the media. Oils supposedly done for, and the majority of those in Congress, enough to get it passed so lets say 51% or roughly 273 votes (like this would ever happen). 

Xom stock is clearly getting destroyed. Call values are in the dirt, IV is rising and call/put flow is super skewed to the out side. They want this to stop. So they begin lobbying to turn supporters into opposition. 

Xom could literally give each of those 273 supporting votes FIVE MILLION, to vote no (which would still leave them with over 2B in cash). Thats a lotta money right? Would you turn that down? 

Well, wait. 

Insider trading is allowed in Congress. So what do you do? You just got 5 Mil to vote no, but it hasnt gone through yet. Time to throw 2 Mil (if not yolo all 5) onto XOM calls knowing that theres a near 100% youll make money on that end and at WORST you lose money that was GIFTED to you in the first place. 

This example is just oil. How on earth do we stop this? Make lobbying illegal yeah, ok. Because if any of us where up there and had likely HUNDREDS of companies lobbying you to stop the anti-lobbying bill how the hell does it ever get through? How do we expect the people

What is Oppfi?

OppFi is a Fintech platform that allows banks to offer lending products (like Upstart but for the subprime borrowers). By leveraging their proprietary AI scoring algorithm, Oppfi is able to approve 29% more loans than traditional models with the same default interest rate.

Oppfi was taken public via SPAC in July 2021

The average Oppfi loan amount is $1500 with a 11 month term and an interest rate between 30%-160%.

Its heavily shorted for no goddamn reason

# 1st Bull: Value and Growth

Revenue has grown from 70mm to 323mm in just 3 years with consistent 30% + in EBITDA margins

The 3 product Oppfi currently offers has a TAM of around $100Bn with less than 1% market penetration.

***Will generate 380mm in revenue and 65mm in profits in 2021.***

Has ***120MM cash*** on hand and a debt/equity ratio of 1.3

Heres the fucked up part***Oppfi's current market cap is around 720mm giving them a forward P/E ratio of around 8 and a P/S ratio of less than 2***. How the fuck do these numbers make any sense given their growth and balance sheet? This stock is literally trading at 2x sales when everyone else in this space is trading at double and triple digit.

# 2nd Bull: Customer Satisfaction

OppFi managed to achieve a **Net Promoter Score of 84**. (metric used in customer experience programs)

To put that number into perspective, look at the companies they are beating out.. **the average banking score is a 36.**

Their google page has an average rating of 4.9 stars with over 10000 reviews.

Whatever their secret sauce isit gives me confidence that this practice will win market shares overtime.

Apparently they have actual phone numbers you can call and talk to real people

# Final Bull: Squeeze

This stock was shorted to shit after being taken public by a SPAC at the worst possible time, but people don't realize this is a real company with a legit balance sheet, high growth and a great management team behind it.

With a low float of 13mm shares and a short float of around 1.8mm shares it could easily break out with a positive catalyst(Q3 ER) which I believe is highly likely due to all the good reports from other fintech companies in recent weeks.

IV has almost tripled last weekprobably due to short sellers hedging against their position.

***OppFI is priced too cheap given their current performance metrics. I see virtually zero down side at todays price but has huge gain potentials.***

In the wake of Deciphera (DCPH) dropping by ~70% last week, I was poking around the news and saw that Cogent Bioscences (COGT) was mentioned in the same breath in at least one report (in that Decipheras trial failure could be opening the door for COGTs success in same type of trial, and that their price target was being upgraded).

Its a tiny company (15 employees?), but a Buy rating with a target of $15 - $31 in the next 12 months currently sitting at $8.80 last close.  52 week high was $13.90.

Earnings is due out 11/9.

Is there anything here you think?  I figured Id pick up a handful of cheap 12/17 $10 calls at .45 cents each today, even though the odds seem slim?

This is my 2nd options play ever, so happy to hear any input.

1. According to SEC rule, only accredited investors can invest in private equity.
2. Definition of private equity=Non-public firms &amp; shares not traded on registered stock exchange.
3. OTC Market(OTCQX/OTCBB/Pinksheet) is not included in registered stock exchange.

If so, the stock brokerage by '[Otcmarket.com](https://Otcmarket.com)' are private equity, so only accredited investors can do it.

However, I couldn't find any information on the site that only accredited investors can invest.

In the end, my question is whether Retail investors(=None Accredited Investors) can trade at the OTC Market(OTCQX/OTCBB/Pinksheet) and does anyone know?

# Digging Through the Listings

First I just looked at the current data from the US cities that saw the most intense growth periods of all the markets in the US (Phoenix, Atlanta, Denver) You can look at my full data set [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTVa_hTgLoLOf-6J9wilqAhSrfrHGUW6kGN_Iw9pFwni1cxg1aNUK0QhmUFpt9dnY3t5iy2RZ65rC_M/pubhtml), but the high level summary are these:

# PHOENIX:

**$Z - Zillow** (own 862 properties) No surprise here, they absolutely shit the bed, and overbid on houses like your grandma buying cat figurines on eBay

https://preview.redd.it/6pnatlrghiy71.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cca44330d2d6f66b36ad921206f5b24100a665c7

**$OPEN - Opendoor** (Own 1761+ properties, the Maricopa county website can't even handle it) The next biggest player here did okay, but they are still lowering prices and taking some hits), clearly trying to lower their inventory levels.

https://preview.redd.it/gyizxmgjhiy71.png?width=578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05c7f6f539d4f2b9644a251c9055ccfd33d98df5

**$OPAD - Offerpad** (Own 206 properties) Doing pretty solid given the change in market. They also don't own many properties, and are purchasing less this quarter (According to data from Mike Delprete)

https://preview.redd.it/sq0yunblhiy71.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb14356b4a9c136ba0dc495a7dd0c2cee9711b5f

# ATLANTA:

**$Z - Zillow** (# properties hard to determine...) Doing a lot better than Phoenix in this Market but still probably underwater after everything is considered.

**$OPEN - Opendoor** (Own 586+ properties, the Maricopa county website can't even handle it) Doing well in this market, probably will be profitable in this region.

**$OPAD - Offerpad** (Own 55+) Very profitable, and they don't hold many properties. It's kind of a detriment as well though as they don't have many properties in a very profitable city.

I'm also working on Denver, Dallas, and Raleigh. So far Zillow is looking terrible in Denver as well, no surprise...

# Is iBuying Screwed?

I'm going to almost exclusively highlight Mike Delprete content in this section, here's a bunch of pretty charts that show how each of the players I analyzed above have done historically. 

The short story is that there might be rocky waters for ahead, but those whose algorithms adjusted properly for the softening of prices will do best (Opendoor and Offerpad). And those with smaller inventories may be hurt the least. (Offerpad?)

&amp;#x200B;

[Zillow's AVM \(Automated Value Model\) was jacked and kept buying at higher prices than competitors](https://preview.redd.it/w8dbtucjwgy71.png?width=544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70395a0e56718340bc774e0577cfc97f38ab350b)

&amp;#x200B;

[Gross Margins leveled off for Zillow, derp. When your model is fucked how can you make monies?](https://preview.redd.it/5ul22mwqwgy71.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb90244bfd3291b77885d7cae311ef802b773b57)

&amp;#x200B;

[Wow, well done indeed Zillow. If you look at my Q3 digging though, Offerpad in particular has a higher net profit per home than they did in Q2. ](https://preview.redd.it/t1zddtcywgy71.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac510e348dae79137459abcbf839a1baebf7ec4)

&amp;#x200B;

Zillow and Opendoor in particular went absolute apeshit purchasing houses over the last couple of quarters, they were definitely in a big dick sword fight. We all know how that ended up for Zillow and I think Opendoor is scrambling a little to make sure that doesn't happen to them by kind of breaking even this quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

[While Opendoor and Offerpad saw the writing on the wall Zillow was ramping up their home purchases. This shows that there was a flaw in decision making and most likely their AVM. ](https://preview.redd.it/hp30omu3eiy71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=828a8c6be17b0cb2f3230c48b08ee3d5475ece0f)

# Financial Juice 

Ok so these companies are making slim margins (if any) is there any viability to this model? Mikey D thinks there is. Offerpad does make profit, and Opendoor is really close and has line of sight to do that. More pretty charts:

&amp;#x200B;

[Uh yikes, that's not a great business plan... although Offerpad has actually turned this positive in Q2 ](https://preview.redd.it/fnbvno2xciy71.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b04acd606b8507561ee3b0742cefb514e5b32ae)

&amp;#x200B;

[Offerpad and Opendoor have a path to profit as long as they can control these costs. This is also before they get a 6&amp;#37; sellers fee, so there is actually some juice here.](https://preview.redd.it/6ykm4j7hdiy71.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c51ea2f9ff88476a1eb80b037ec75bda1ce898bb)

**Zillow on the otherhand was always fucked:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Even in a good case where they had some revenue they were always underwater. Multiply this thousands of times and you have a recipe for disaster. ](https://preview.redd.it/242tgg1sdiy71.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27b549c39dfe50c7fe9decfdb012683382ecafc7)

# Risks

\- Market slowdowns continue and Opendoor and Offerpad slow down purchasing significantly, while this protects their margins, it will hurt their revenue. Perhaps the biggest Catch22 of iBuying. 

\- Opendoor is too big, and Offerpad is too small. Scale is difficult to do in this space safely

\- Zillow dumping $2.8 Billon dollars of inventory softens the rest of the market. 

\- China. They are not buying US investment properties now (great, fuck them), but it might soften things as well.

# TL:DR 

# Ok cool, now what am I supposed to do with a bunch of charts?

A huge player with 26% market share just collapsed and left a huge void to fill for two players that have potentially much better algorithms and handles on their business. From my price analysis, Offerpad in particular seems to give zero fucks about any slowdown and is still making great margins. Also Opendoor, while not as strong as an iBuyer is expanding their business into mortgage with their latest acquisition, so they are making some interesting moves as well. Should you move in on this area like the vulture you are and capitalize? **Maybe, I'm not a financial advisor take this interesting data and do whatever you want.**

For myself I'm throwing down on **$OPAD**, I'm a sucker for profitability, what can I say... GL to all if you play the Wednesday earnings calls, may we all ride to Vahalla. Unless you invested in Z, then my condolences.

**Disclaimer:** My total cost was $299,178



**$CNK** has yet to recover from its pre-pandemic levels primarily because the types of institutions that buy this stock are risk adverse. They prefer the predictable environment and they still have concerns about COVID and **$CNK** currently has their dividend suspended.

Movie theatre stocks (that trade on fundamentals) trade in correlation to box office numbers. Earnings are fairly predictable since box office sales are updated daily. 



**Here are some data points on some promising numbers:**



Q1 2019: $2,400,025,631	

Q1 2021: $236,724,645	

**9.8%** of pre pandemic levels


Q2 2019: $3,261,541,363	

Q2 2021: $798,319,424

**24.4%** of pre pandemic levels


Q3 2019: $2,812,787,590	

Q3 2021: $1,366,685,951

**48.5%** of pre pandemic levels



**Here are some promising stats on Q4 so far:**


October 2019: $781,639,168

October 2021: $622,242,307

**79.607%** of pre pandemic levels



So the question is: Will November and December follow?

I believe the answer is **yes** and I've also commissioned a box office analyst to make some projections for Q4 2021.



**October: Ongoing:**

**November**

https://imgur.com/9nWwQoa


**December**

https://imgur.com/OEbjOHQ

https://imgur.com/HE8Y8Dt



**Note: These projections were finished before Eternals weekend, so the opening projection was fairly accurate**



These projections take into consideration the current macro environment in relation to COVID, as well as current 

sentiment for each film. Cases continue to go down. Vaccines and booster shots have been proven effective and 

now the new pill is the nail in the coffin. COVID will be treated like the annual flu eventually.



I base my trades on asymmetry in risk/reward and I believe there's an opportunity here. The stock could trade flat
 
in the next few weeks as there are no new releases but the weekend of 11/19 Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a movie to 

keep an eye on. After that, Ecanto will be available on Thank giving weekend. Encanto looks similar to Coco and 

Moana and will most likely be a huge hit. This will allow box office sales for November to close in on 80% recovery 

up to 107% recovery. 




**December** projections are a little less optimistic than November primarily because its missing a 3rd weekend for its mid December releases.

**Spiderman: No Way Home, The King's Man, The Matrix: Resurrections, Sing 2 will be missing an extra Saturday and Sunday.**

But nothing is off the table with the Spiderman potentially having Tobey and Andrew giving it Avenger level 

numbers. Regardless, I'm more on the optimistic side of these projections but would like to provide the possible 

risks fairly. The biggest risk IMO is that institutions could continue on being cowards. The DEC and JAN calls would

be most at risk. Hopefully markets will be forward-looking.




**In conclusion**

I believe Q4 2021's slate of films will do fairly well and continue the recovery at ~80% 2019 levels. I'm making the call **$CNK** could be trading at

25-30 levels at the end of November / mid December. BUT I definitely think by Q1 or Q2 2022, we will be back to 2019 levels.

There is a good reason that  many of the GME OGs have noticed BG\*V, henceforth known as BiG Fucking Value.

Shout out to u/Lawlpaper, u/Linkme214, u/Uberkikz11, u/Birbigd99,  and many others for providing great DD on BG\*V. This post serves to  consolidate the various DD posts on this play and why BG\*V is poised to  breakout from a fundamental and mechanical perspective. Not financial  advice.

Fair Valuation:

The latest earnings had an EPS of $1.07 which  gives BG\*V a P/E ratio of 6.59. Two competitors in the B&amp;M space are  Dicks Sporting Goods (DKS) &amp; Academy Sports (ASO), both of whom  have higher P/E ratios of 10.81 and 8.34, respectively. For reference,  the S&amp;P has a P/E ratio of 27.07 but this isn't a fair comparison.  At these same valuations, BG\*V would be priced between $38.46 and  $49.85, taking the average we can settle for a fair valuation of $44 based on traditional valuation metrics alone.

Taking  a look at Q3 earnings and you'll notice they reported $1.07, short of  the $1.13 forecasted. But the devil is in the details and what you may  not have realized is that their pre-July 4th weeks (one of the busiest  times) was shifted from Q3 where it normally is to Q2. BG\*V demolished  Q2 EPS forecast (reported $1.63 against $1.08 forecast) and revenue  (326.02M against 291.65M). Were it not for the shift in accounting  practices (due to a 53-week fiscal 2020 calendar), Q3 earnings and  revenue would have easily beat forecasts. Additionally, the west coast  has been ridden with massive wildfires over August and September, which  closed down California national forests and impacted sales over key  holiday periods. In case you didn't know, the majority of Big 5 stores  are located on the west coast. To get a better gauge on how well sales  were this past quarter, comparing Q3 2021 with Q3 2019, net sales were  up 10.3% (289.6M vs 266.2M) and same-store sales increased 13.2% versus  the 2019 third quarter.

But  what about future supply chain disruptions? In the earnings conference  CEO Steve Miller had this to say, ""we believe our inventory should be  sufficiently well-positioned to produce solid fourth-quarter results  that significantly exceed pre-pandemic levels."" When pressed to further  comment by Mark Smith of Lake St Capital Markets about supply chain  constraints, CEO Steve Miller responded, ""we have the lion's share of  what we need for Black Friday and the holidays."" Ground-level recon  check of a local Big 5 over the weekend checks out.

Dividend:

In the last Q3 earnings call on 11/3, CEO Steve Miller opened up the conference with the following statement.

""Given  the sustained strength, cash flow generation, and positive outlook of  our business, we have declared another special cash dividend of $1 per  share in addition to our regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per  share.""

This is the 2nd time this  year BG\*V has issued a special dividend of $1 per share of common stock,  to be paid on 12/1/2021 to stockholders holding BG\*V on the ex-dividend  date of 11/17. This is in addition to their regular $0.25 dividend.  That is how much money they have. Let that sink in. What does this mean  for the shorts? This means that for every share that is short, $1.25  must be paid in cash. This amounts to roughly $10.65M (1.25 x 8.5 =  10.65) that short hedge funds need to produce. Now that amount in itself  isn't enough to negatively affect these funds, but what is is the  organic increase in valuation of share price as long-term holders flock  to a strong company paying out a great dividend. At the last closing  price of $30.39, the Q3 dividend is an easy 4.11%, not bad for a  quarter. For the year BG\*V will be returning $3+ in dividends when  investors were only expecting $1. This is a gold mine for the long-term  dividend holder. Now, this next part may be purely coincidental but the  ex-dividend date for the special dividend is 11/17, days before the  November option chain expires.

Aside  from a generous dividend that appeals to long-term holders, the special  dividend reflects the strong fundamentals of this company. Your typical  PnD does not have the same balance sheet and provides a dividend.  Bullish and undervalued.

What  happened the last time a special dividend was announced in Q2? The price  was around $19 with a little over 4M shares short. Over the following  days, it peaked at $34, an 80% increase. Now BG\*V has over twice as many  shares short at around 9M.

&amp;#x200B;

Astute Management and Stock Buyback:

Steve  Miller and his management team know what they are doing and how to  remain lean in a post-COVID world. They know how to keep operating costs  down, how to return value to shareholders, how to remain ahead in a  supply-constrained environment.

BG\*V  has optimized its B&amp;M strategy with strategic store openings and  lean operating costs, illustrated by their much smaller sq. ft stores in  comparison with the competition.

Oh,  and they also repurchased 100,498 shares. No dilutions here. This isn't  just another PnD or short squeeze play that gets killed with a  dilution. In fact, BG\*V has set aside 13M in cash for their stock  buyback program. When pressed to comment on upcoming share repurchases,  Barry Emerson, danced around the question and cited the companies goal  of ""returning value to shareholders."" I have high conviction in BG\*V's  leadership and management and fully expect them to complete their stock  buyback program in the 4th quarter.

Small Float and High Short Interest:

But  who are we kidding? None of you care about strong balance sheets,  fundamentals, forward guidance, yadda yadda. Aside from the above, here  are the market mechanics of why BiG Fucking Value is about to rocket. 

BG\*V  is one of the most highly shorted companies on the market right now.  But it has a big distinction of not being a trash company with trash  fundamentals.

Key Metrics:

Current Shares Short: 8.5M as of 10/15, but currently closer to \~9 Million

Reported Float: 20.33 Million

% of Float Shorted: 44.14%

Utilization: 100%

Cost to Borrow: 10.2%

Note  that the current short interest is twice what it was in May when BG\*V  almost doubled in price after the last earnings special dividend  announcement.

&amp;#x200B;

But how much float is there really? This is hard to calculate, but let's make some estimates.

Free Float = Outstanding Shares - Restricted Shares - Closely-held Shares

\-  BG\*V was added to the Russel 3000 in July. As a result, institutional  holdings and index holdings of BG\*V increased. There's about 1.7M in  recent purchases but I won't consider this against the float since these  are held by funds that are freely able to trade BG\*V. However, when we  look at the number of shares held by the top 20 Funds mirroring relevant  index funds including the Russell, we get 4.6M shares.

In case you're curious, the top 20 Institutions hold 9.6M shares (43.6% of outstanding shares)

\- Insiders hold about 1.8M of shares (8.2 % of outstanding)

So that gives us a calculation of:

22M outstanding shares - 4.6M shares held in index funds - 1.8M insider shares = 15.6M Float

Using 8.5M shares short based on 10/15 data, the actual SI of the Implied Float is closer to 54.5%, easily making BG\*V one of the highest shorted companies on the market.

But  why is BG\*V being shorted? Shorts holding on to the notion that B&amp;M  stores are gone for good, rising eCommerce competition, belief COVID-19  would cause bankruptcy, supply constraints, the list goes on. But the  fact is, BG\*V is an undervalued company with strong fundamentals and  cash reserves, and the shorts are not in a good position. And contrary  to many other ""short squeeze"" candidates, BG\*V has no intention of  diluting shareholders, they aim to do the opposite with their buyback  program.

Additionally, BG\*V has  reached a Utilization of 100% on 11/5 for the first time. Per Ortex,  ""Utilization shows how many percent of the lendable shares are currently  lent out."" This means shorts are running out of shares to short this  further.

&amp;#x200B;

So what happened Thursday?  What we saw on Thursday when BG\*V went from $31 to $42 was not shorts  covering (supported by that day's ORTEX data). That was FOMO and PnDers  generating a pump as described before. This does not need the help of  pumpers, you don't need to FOMO. This is a purely mechanical play. Let  the price appreciate organically, show the shorts that BG\*V is a strong  company worth investing in, and let the shorts cover.

&amp;#x200B;

Market Manipulation:

TD  Ameritrade was calling clients on the phone with significant holdings  in BG\*V on Thursday am (11/4) and offering to buy shares for $41 when  BG\*V was trading at $36! Think about it, that makes no sense. TDA is  just a brokerage, so a fund is incentivizing TDA to call their whale  clients holding BG\*V on the phone to offer 17% above market price (at  the time). Almost everyone getting that call would say yes.

&amp;#x200B;

So  why would someone want to offer $41 for a massive amount of shares when  the market price is $35? Follow the motive and you'll have your answer  ...

If I was a hedge fund heavily  short in BG\*V and being the good steward of my company's assets I'd  peruse Reddit to get the latest on what retail is thinking. I'd discover  that BG\*V has the potential to become the next meme stock, which would  be very bad for my short positions. How do I derail a company from  becoming the next meme stock? Tarnish its reputation by making it look  like another PnD. How? I borrow as many shares as possible by offering  17% above the market price. Once I've accumulated as many shares as  possible with a CB of $41, I market sell them near my cost basis, which  is what we saw when BG\*V got above $42. The subsequent sell wall caused  secondary sells from stop-loss hunting. The next part may be  coincidental, but an even better way to tarnish BG\*V as another PnD is  to associate the PA with known PnD'ers. How? I time my market sell to  when some notable Pump and Dumpers tweet about it (cough cough Atlas  cough cough) and the entire thing looks like a perfectly engineered PnD.

&amp;#x200B;

Except  this is not just another low float, high short interest PnD. It has a  strong balance sheet, zero debt, strong management that knows how to  optimize a B&amp;M business in an e-commerce world. What can we  extrapolate from all this market manipulation? The shorts are fearful of  their short positions and will do anything to prevent BG\*V from  becoming a squeeze/meme stock. They've also improved their game since  GME. Not sure about you but I think retail is getting sick of being  bullied by hedge funds and market manipulation.

How Will This Play Out and Price Targets?

BG\*V  is starting to grab a lot of attention. I think per fair valuation that  $50 is a conservative PT. When you throw short burn/squeeze and meme  potential, the price targets become difficult to measure. The truth is  no one knows. I expect a lot of volatility in the coming days and my  personal risk tolerance keeps me in shares only. Shorts have until 11/17  to close their positions to avoid paying out the special dividend but  as I mentioned earlier I think organic price appreciation due to strong  fundamentals and leadership leading to buying pressure will put more  pressure on the shorts, the dividend payout is just extra toppings.  Expect the shorts to pull every dirty trick out of the book and more.

Tl;dr:

One of the highest shorted companies that is profitable with a very strong balance sheet (very unusual!)

Outstanding Shares: 22M; Implied Float: 15.6M shares

SI of Implied Float: 54.5%

PE is under 7, comps in this sector are closer to 10.

Strong cash balance sheet, zero debt

Q3 Dividend: $1.25 (4.11% return based on Friday's closing price of $30.39)

Price action being manipulated by hedge funds at retail's expense

The  setup for an unfairly beaten-down stock with good fundamentals and  forward guidance with a low float and high SI has not been seen since  GME. At this price, even without the meme or squeeze potential,  BG\*V is an excellent buy. There is a good reason that many of the GME  OGs have noticed BiG Fucking Value.  But most importantly, BG\*V is just another example of price  manipulation by hedgies at the expense of retail. We are not the Dumb  Money and we're sick of being bullied, we are BiG Fucking Value.

As always, not financial advice, be accountable for your own decisions, don't degen into calls.

Positions: 3500 shares @ 35

1,"11/09/2021, 13:17:20",Why Intel Is The Play. To the  and beyond.,Last_Interview_4332,"**BULL CASES**

/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.

/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.

/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.

For reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).

/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.

/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.

/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.

/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming in both power consumption and power. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. 

However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.

*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*

/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.

/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.

/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.

/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?

/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.

**Bear Cases**

/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR by management's conservative estimates.

/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are unreliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.

/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.

/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.

/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpwkcu/why_intel_is_the_play_to_the_and_beyond/

1,"11/09/2021, 13:08:56",Big 5 Sporting Goods AKA Big Ginormous Fucking Value AKA BiG Fucking Value (50% Short Interest),GMEsquoze," The setup for an unfairly beaten-down stock with strong fundamentals, zero debt, a strong balance sheet, and good forward guidance with a low float and high SI has not been seen since GME. There is a good reason that many of the GME OGs have noticed it, henceforth known as **BiG Fucking Value**.

**Fair Valuation:**

BGFV has 22 million shares, with Yesterday's closing price of $35. The latest earnings had an EPS of $1.07 which gives BGFV a P/E ratio of 6.59. Two competitors in the B&amp;M space are Dicks Sporting Goods (DKS) &amp; Academy Sports (ASO), both of whom  have higher P/E ratios of 10.81 and 8.34, respectively. For reference,  the S&amp;P has a P/E ratio of 27.07 but this isn't a fair comparison.  At these same valuations, BGFV would be priced between $38.46 and  $49.85, taking the average we can settle for a **fair valuation of $44 based on traditional valuation metrics alone**.

Taking  a look at Q3 earnings and you'll notice they reported $1.07, short of  the $1.13 forecasted. But the devil is in the details and what you may  not have realized is that their pre-July 4th weeks (one of the busiest  times) was shifted from Q3 where it normally is to Q2. BGFV demolished  Q2 EPS forecast (reported $1.63 against $1.08 forecast) and revenue  (326.02M against 291.65M). Were it not for the shift in accounting  practices (due to a 53-week fiscal 2020 calendar), Q3 earnings and  revenue would have easily beat forecasts. Additionally, the west coast  has been ridden with massive wildfires over August and September, which  closed down California national forests and impacted sales over key  holiday periods. In case you didn't know, the majority of Big 5 stores  are located on the west coast. To get a better gauge on how well sales  were this past quarter, comparing Q3 2021 with Q3 2019, net sales were  up 10.3% (289.6M vs 266.2M) and same-store sales increased 13.2% versus  the 2019 third quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

But what about future supply chain disruptions? In the earnings conference  CEO Steve Miller had this to say, ""we believe our inventory should be  sufficiently well-positioned to produce solid fourth-quarter results  that significantly exceed pre-pandemic levels."" When pressed to further  comment by Mark Smith of Lake St Capital Markets about supply chain  constraints, CEO Steve Miller responded, ""we have the lion's share of  what we need for Black Friday and the holidays."" Ground-level recon  check of a local Big 5 over the weekend checks out.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dividend:**

In the last Q3 earnings call on 11/3, CEO Steve Miller opened up the conference with the following statement.

""Given  the sustained strength, cash flow generation, and positive outlook of  our business, we have declared another special cash dividend of $1 per  share in addition to our regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per  share.""

This is the 2nd time this  year BGFV has issued a special dividend of $1 per share of common stock,  to be paid on 12/1/2021 to stockholders holding BGFV on the ex-dividend  date of 11/17. This is in addition to their regular $0.25 dividend.  That is how much money they have. Let that sink in. What does this mean  for the shorts? This means that for every share that is short, $1.25  must be paid in cash. This amounts to roughly $10.65M (1.25 x 8.5 =  10.65) that short hedge funds need to produce. Now that amount in itself  isn't enough to negatively affect these funds, but what is is the  organic increase in valuation of share price as long-term holders flock  to a strong company paying out a great dividend. At the last closing  price of $30.39, the Q3 dividend is an easy 4.11%, not bad for a  quarter. For the year BGFV will be returning $3+ in dividends when  investors were only expecting $1. This is a gold mine for the long-term  dividend holder. Now, this next part may be purely coincidental but the  ex-dividend date for the special dividend is 11/17, days before the  November option chain expires.

Aside  from a generous dividend that appeals to long-term holders, the special  dividend reflects the strong fundamentals of this company. Your typical  PnD does not have the same balance sheet and provides a dividend.  Bullish and undervalued.

What  happened the last time a special dividend was announced in Q2? The price  was around $19 with a little over 4M shares short. Over the following  days, it peaked at $34, an 80% increase. Now BGFV has over twice as many  shares short at around 9M.

&amp;#x200B;

**Astute Management and Stock Buyback:**

Steve  Miller and his management team know what they are doing and how to  remain lean in a post-COVID world. They know how to keep operating costs  down, how to return value to shareholders, how to remain ahead in a  supply-constrained environment.

BGFV  has optimized its B&amp;M strategy with strategic store openings and  lean operating costs, illustrated by their much smaller sq. ft stores in  comparison with the competition. Oh,  and they also repurchased 100,498 shares. No dilutions here. This isn't  just another PnD or short squeeze play that gets killed with a  dilution. In fact, BGFV has set aside 13M in cash for their stock  buyback program. When pressed to comment on upcoming share repurchases,  Barry Emerson, danced around the question and cited the companies goal  of ""returning value to shareholders."" I have high conviction in BGFV's  leadership and management and fully expect them to complete their stock  buyback program in the 4th quarter.

**Small Float and High Short Interest:**

But  who are we kidding? None of you care about strong balance sheets,  fundamentals, forward guidance, yadda yadda. Aside from the above, here  are the market mechanics of why BiG Fucking Value is about to rocket.  BGFV  is one of the most highly shorted companies on the market right now.  But it has a big distinction of not being a trash company with trash  fundamentals.

22M outstanding shares - 4.6M shares held in index funds - 1.8M insider shares = 15.6M Float

Using 8.5M shares short based on 10/15 data, the **actual SI of the Implied Float is closer to 54.5%**, easily making BGFV one of the highest shorted companies on the market.

I was down big, I owed debts to friends which followed me into Bearish trades all last year. down nearly 160k earlier this year and almost nothing in my trading account, I hung my hat in shame. Trading isn't for me.

But the one stock I thought to rule them all was a long shot and it's slow movement made it almost unnoticeable to most of WSB. At the point where SPY broke 450 I realized hyperinflation is upon us, so what stock is safe? I thought and researched.

You might see previous posts I had touting Ford as better than Tesla, Biden being in leagues with Ford,  Ford working with Google vs. GM with Microsoft and Apple Car. Uber was working with Ford Fusions back in 2014 in driverless cars. Ford's Rivian was better than GMs Nikola partnership. I kept asking myself, how is Ford worth the same as Nikola. Ford is AMERICANA. Infrastructure bill passed. Hello boom town.

So when my grandma announced she was selling her house which I had a 135k stake. I went to a rich friend and borrowed under that deal 100k, stuffed it all in 1960 F calls for next year Jan 21 2022. Sold out my 150k just last week. On track to 1 Mil by my birthday. I think I could've made 10 Mil if I went for 20 OTM calls instead of 15 ITM calls but hell, I needed to play it safe.

Well that's my story,  Good luck guys, Diamond hands to all my friends who followed me one last time..

Jan 21 2022 22.5 Call X 1000

Jul 15 2022 22.5 Call X 500


*Disclaimer:* My total cost is $299,178. I have been buying since August when it was ~14/share.


$CNK has yet to recover from its pre pandemic levels. This is because the institutions that primarily buy this type of stock are

risk adverse boomers. They are dependent on $CNK's dividend (which is suspended currently) and are waiting for box office numbers to return to pre pandemic levels.

OCT'2021 Box Office sales recovered to ~80% of OCT'2019 levels and will continue in NOV'2021 and DEC'2021. 


*Box office sales comparison Q3'19 vs Q3'21*
 
Q3 2019: $2,812,787,590

Q3 2021: $1,366,685,951

Q3 2021 Box Office sales: 48.588% of 2019's levels.


Q4 2021 will continue the recover to pre pandemic numbers.

October 2021 finished at $622,242,307 in sales.

That is 79.6% of 2019's numbers: $781,639,168


Will this trend continue through Nov and Dec? There is a very high chance it will. 

I commissioned a box office analyst for projections with a best/worst case scenario.

https://imgur.com/WAbzk9G


Overperformance/Underperformance are based on current sentiment of each film + macro COVID environment. 

With cases going down / boosters shots / new pill, the underperformance metric becomes unlikely. COVID will be treated like the annual flu.

Based on these projections November box office sales will end at 81.967% of 2019's numbers. 

If November's release slate all do well, there is a world where 2021 November sales will beat out 2019's. 

With an assumption $1,028,500,000 in sales for November 2021, it will be 107.223% of 2019's sales ($959,213,976)

This is a small chance of happening but it's possible.


December is projected at 75.794% - 94.816% (Regular projections - Overperformance metric only)

December's regular projection is lower because the big films coming out after Dec 17 will only have 2 full weekends for Q4'21.

December 31st is a Friday (so we're missing two weekend days that will be counted in Q1'22)

(Spider-Man: No Way Home, The King's Man, The Matrix Resurrections, and Sing 2 are missing an extra Sat/Sun)

Markets are forward looking so this shouldn't be too big of an issue and will just add to Q1 2022's numbers.


So what are the risks? The recovery could take another quarter or two. 

(Marvel moved its 2022 release dates one quarter over and there won't be a Marvel film in Q1'22 unless you count Morbius)

The Dec and Jan calls are definitely on the risky side but I'm more confident about Jul 15 2022 ones. 


Earnings typically don't matter with movie theatre stocks (that trade on fundamentals) because the numbers are fairly easy to predict

based on box office sales that are updated daily. The only exception is if the company provides guidance on when they will reinstate their dividend.

$CNK did improve their market share by 1% in Q3 (as said in their last earnings).


LASTLY: My trading strategy has always been trading positions that have asymmetric risk/reward and I feel there is opportunity here. 

This trade is based on these numbers but I am more on the optimistic side of the recovery.


*BONUS:* Will this squeeze? Probably not. There is some short interest but a key factor in the meme treatment of a stock is an insider/leader pumping or trashing short sellers. 

GME: DFV/COHEN (the original)

AMC: CEO AARON (pump master)

RKT: JAY FARNER (trash talking short sellers: even though their squeeze was short lived)

$CNK management are fairly quiet and only communicate traditionally through earnings or investor events and are fairly tamed. 


*GL* 


*Here's the research that I commissioned:*

NOTE: This analysis was before the release of Eternals so the opening projection for it was fairly spot on.

Included are also some of October releases because some of their numbers are still ongoing.

1,"11/09/2021, 12:21:35",Uranium stocks broke out of a bull flag today!! Time to buy my green apes,LokiPokee,"https://imgur.com/a/HgY2pXG

This chart is for URA a uranium ETF, literally every uranium stock is following the same chart right now.

The bull flag developed over the last 3 months and today confirmed break out.

The top blue line represents an upper resistance level created during a bullish run. The picture is of a yearly chart but it actually rejected off this resistance line 4 times. The bottom blue line represents the bottom resistance level. As you can see each time the upper resistance level is rejected the the bottom line keeps getting raised creating higher lows. This allows the 50dma and 200dma to catch up to the recent break out. When there are finally no more lows to be made its break out time! And today URA broke above that $29.xx resistance.

How high will it go? In the bull flag pattern you take the previous break out, the black line which is the pole and plop it on top of the upper blue line. In URA the pole was formed $17.28 to $29.45 a $12.17 difference. This tells us the breakout target will be $41.62. Todays close was $30.83, so we have a 35% run ahead of us.

This isnt a instant one day run, it will happen over the next month and can be delayed by market events. As you can see in the bottom blue line, there was a 2 week lull around $23 before it tested the upper resistance again. This was caused by the market shake up by evergrande. Similar events may happen causing lulls delaying the ascent to $41. This post is not financial advice but if it were I would not recommend buying weeklies incase of macro events.

I know how the options are valued, the premium shit, etc. But I've got one question that I can't seem to find the answer to.

Say I buy one call option for a premium of $1/share and a strike price of $20. Say the stock goes up to $30. Obviously I've made bank and have a profit of $900, and I want to exercise the option to secure those profits.

My question is, to **exercise** the call option, do I need to have $2,000 available to buy the 100 shares at $20? Or do you not need extra funds to actually exercise the option, and do you just automatically take the profits of $9/share?

I don't want to buy my first option only for me to not have the funds to exercise it and lose a bunch on a premium, so some clarity here would help a lot. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpvc9m/do_i_need_to_have_the_funds_to_buy_100_shares_at/

FuboTV is reporting earnings tomorrow after market close. This is why I think it will rocket up.

Looking at the website traffic to [Fubo.tv](https://Fubo.tv) you can see a large increase over last year. 

[You can see that some months are double what they were from last year. Also seems to be growing in a faster pace.](https://preview.redd.it/8ndg2vwcsgy71.png?width=1050&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d0d356d58b282de5144c13e7d12abb3e0f648c)

And quarterly. 

[You can read at the bottom there that the visits since last quarter are up 32&amp;#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/vokbutbjsgy71.png?width=1233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2266fb7fa2e6daa2abc4e9d2cc35b9d176b0e0ae)

Just one more screenshot showing the growth.

This is the data from Google trends. You can see that it has been staying steady and has higher peaks.

The Reddit subscribers to the FuboTV subreddit have been growing at a steady rate and even faster than last year and quarter.

here are some app store statistics.

And the new sportsbook app.  

[Although it is new, you can see that  people are downloading it and it is getting more recognition.](https://preview.redd.it/prxyquztthy71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f750f05678ecc57ef643a0040005530af59ff1e)

Recent analysts have raised their price targets. On 11/1 a price target was raised from $30 to $38. On 10/19 there was a price target of $50. The average analyst has a price target of $44.63.

FuboTV has also been adding their sports betting system to more states. Their mobile sportsbook just recently opened in Iowa, Arizona and many more.

They also have many new partnerships including being the official gaming operator of NASCAR, a deal with AT&amp;T Sportsnet, Cleveland Cavaliers, Paysafe, ROOT Sports, Vizio, New York Jets, and many more. This shows their willingness to grow their platform. 

When the World Cup qualifiers were on they had free-to-play games along side the live games that brought massive traffic to the website. Between August and September unique visitors increased by 71%. The subscriber base has tripled in two years and the addition of the sportsbook can make that even bigger. 

Overall I think that they will have more subscribers than what is estimated and they will top their numbers. Personally I think this can bust straight through 40 on good numbers.

Mind blown! ,ShortlessScared,"Isn't it curious how when a stock moves, especially downwards, there's magically a coordinated hit piece that they (news media) can point to as the cause. When in reality, it's the effect because they needed a ""tangible"" reason for investors to look at the movement of a stock and say ""well that's why it sold off.""

[This article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apparel-shortages-drive-bumper-holiday-150537338.html) basically called the REAL beat, and expects POSH to have a similar outcome(POSH reports tomorrow after market close).  The author states that more than a third of all holiday shoppers will buy consignment or second-hand this holiday season as a result of supply chain issues, and the fact that most inventory for POSH and other second-hand retailers comes from the US instead of being shipped internationally makes it more sheltered from those shipping issues.  The average price target for POSH is $43, and the stock is currently trading at $23.  Analysts are bullish on the stock, with Wedbush initiating coverage at a buy earlier this month with a $32 price target.  5 analysts have it at a buy, 1 at overweight, and 3 at hold.  

&amp;#x200B;

Short interest in POSH peaked in July right before their last earnings announcement, and has been drastically declining since. The stock sold off  almost 20% after management warned of a lackluster upcoming quarter.  The market is forward looking, so if management raises guidance going into the holiday season, like REAL did, I think we can get a breakout.

I'm not big on TA, but I love this chart.  The stock has been absolutely beaten down since its IPO.  You can see it has been consolidating in the $23-30 range since its last earnings report in August.  It's currently sitting right on its point of control(the price where the stock has seen the highest trading volume).  This is usually where institutions are buying it up.  The stochastic RSI is ready to cross and begin showing upward momentum, and the RSI has been rising while the stock has been trading relatively sideways, indicating more buyers are stepping up.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a position yet, but I'll probably throw a grand or two on some Nov 19 $25 and $30 calls tomorrow.  Best of luck if you tail.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qptc2y/posh_may_be_a_solid_earnings_play_tuesday/

Now, some of you might be thinking that a 17% short interest isn't high at all.  My response?  Look at Avis ($CAR)!! They had a short interest of 20% and the shorts got squeezed to hell.  $MARA earnings are going to be either this week or next week.  Considering that $MARA has increased the number of ""Boobies"" it mined in October to 417.7, they are poised not only to beat analyst expectations, but to beat the living shit out of them.   

&amp;#x200B;

Just today in the afterhours, $MARA went up  $3.50.  The squeeze is gonna happen boys.  It's not going to be as dramatic as $GME, but it will happen.  Don't miss your chance to hop on the Tendietown Express!

&amp;#x200B;

* Nearly one-fourth of all Lemonade shares are sold short, while nearly one-third of the float is.
* Since January, the stock's losses have emboldened short sellers, and invited even more.
* The company will need to convince shareholders that its current losses are poised to shrink rather than continue expanding as the company's top line does.

The image below speaks volumes, plotting this year's fall in Lemonade stock's price against a steep rise in the number of Lemonade shares being sold short. Traders bet against the stock in a big way beginning in the latter half of 2020, when the stock started to rally following last July's IPO. But the more it's pulled back from January's high, the more the market's sold the stock short. As of the latest tally, 13.5 million of Lemonade's 61.5 million outstanding shares are shorted. That's an incredible 22% of the total number of shares and an even-greater 31% of the stock's float (not shown) of 42.7 million shares.

1,"11/09/2021, 09:33:02",NVDA - an autist bullish case,badoptionsguy,"Good evening ladies and gents,

For the last 2 weeks I have traded NVDA every trading day. Converting my small $800 investment into $22,000 within these said 2 weeks.

NVDA Price action always follows the same pattern from what I have noticed. We open high and its either push higher or come crashing back down only to recover later during power hour or the following day.

For the last 3 trading days NVDA has had some amazing price movements. Giving me the ability to turn 800 into 22 thousand. At one point reaching $42k but as a true autist I did not sell.

This stock has given us some amazing returns YOY. For tomorrow we can expect NVDA to break to new ATH (if it is able to break through 314). We can see a very bullish case of 314, 317, 320, 338. I am not saying this will happen tomorrow or the next day. All I am saying is if we break through tomorrow we can make some sweet tendies.

Yesterday I gave a trade idea which I did not take due to going deep into nada. This call out was AMD $145C Nov 12. These were trading at 1 and went up to 10.6 over 2 days. They won MSFT and METAs business. However, I believe that NVDA will run tomorrow since they also have an event regarding their omniverse business.

For tomorrow $320 weeklies will be hot. See chart above for a clear view of this bullish pennant. With that I wish you guys luck and lets make some money.

  *My broski-in-law likes companies that sell ""dopamine hits,"" like tobacco and addictive computer applications:*

""The idea is the \~4 year warrants (15th Jan 2026 expiration) on Glass House Brands shares (OTC: [GHBWF](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GHBWF/overview)) which are currently trading for $1.22 and have a strike price of $11.50 for the underlying, common shares of Glass House Brands Inc. ([GLASF](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GLASF/overview)) which are trading for $4.80. The warrants are obviously out of the money but have a long time until expiration.  


Glass House Brands is a busted SPAC that owns an unusual asset: the 2nd largest greenhouse in the United States (six million square feet under glass), located just outside sunny Santa Barbara, California.

The greenhouse is state of the art and was a profitable concern growing tomatoes for a buck a pound and wholesaling them at 1.05. The greenhouse was purchased for cash and stock after the SPAC was funded and what caught my eye was that the experienced owner who was the seller took a large part of his consideration in shares rather than cash. At $4.80 the equity trades for about the value the insiders received in the initial SPAC deal. The market cap is not much above my estimate of the real estate value.

The greenhouse is being converted from tomatoes to Cannabis by an experienced operator and management team. Cannabis, even wholesale, will have much larger margins than tomatoes. This farm may be the lowest cost grower of Cannabis in the US as the year round temperatures in this region will not require much heating or cooling costs. The company just reported this from a recent study: ""the average indoor grow uses 262 kilowatt-hour per square foot of flower (kWh/SF). The average greenhouse grow used 134 kWh/SF. Glass Houses average was 13 kWh/SF.  


In addition to the ramp up of the greenhouse, Glass House Brands has ownership of several dispensaries, well known and liked brands, and plans to ramp up to 21 total dispensaries in California over the next few years.  


Catalysts are: ramp up of the greenhouse and dispensaries, Congress passing safe banking and Interstate deregulation of Cannabis, and potential future uplisting of the stock. I like how four year call options (the warrants) offer plenty of time for the thesis to work out.

1,"11/09/2021, 09:06:51",APPS stock potential,Lavi1012,"I wouldn't lable this a DD but rather my earnest opinion on the stock's future. 

APPS (digital turbine) is one of the most successful montizaion app that allows individuals and companies to earn money using DT built in ADS and video programs. I think ADs in general are there to stay and scale futher as the internet scales worldwide and becomes visible everywhere. It is a growing niche that APPS is taking advantage off. 

Looking at numbers, APPS has beaten every single eraning report and its growth is impossible to ignore. Revenue keeps growing and the company seems to be well aware of how it is going to progress futher(recently they have expanded into internet TV). 

Why APPS is an opportunity at the moment? from objective point of view, APPS was 90 dollar per share nearly 2 weeks ago, At the 02 of november APPS had positive earning report of  \*\***0.44**/0.39 ESP\*\* and  \*\***310.21M**/306.53M\*\*  revenue, growing by nearly \*\*100m(33 percent)\*\* from their last earning.  it's also impotant to mention that the company ceo stated that the next earning is going to get beaten aswell, which means the company is still growing.

\*\*And yet the stock has fallen 20 percent at the given day\*\* . The reason for that, in my opinion is either of the following

1. Big players shorting/taking profit with interest to keep the stock a tad longer at 50-80 before allowing it to hit 100+(which is usually a psychological barrier and a very strong resistance/support point
2. The earning was priced in, meaning the actual price of the stock after its earning was supposed to be 70, meaning the 90 per share was just temporaily over-valued point.

In my opinion, APPS is a strong short/mid/long term stock that is growing and should benefit all form of investors.

There are a lot of discussion if shiping rates will stay high or not in the middle and long term. 

But please, just see the ratios at which zim is trading and you tell me. Keep reading, please

PER (TTM; Trailing 12 months) = 2,87 and also gross margin growing consistently

But everybody knows that shiping rates were a lot higher in Q1 &amp; Q2 2021 than Q3 &amp; Q4 2020.

So, clearly this is not a precise measurement. ***Financials statements show us the past, you should predict the future***

Lets see what happened during 2021

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ei38ev8hlgy71.png?width=833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ceac7b0d2c470724bdea9d29278d110e6a6a426

&amp;#x200B;

All of you can see that Q3 &amp; Q4 from 2021 are a lot higher than Q1 &amp; Q2 2021. And I think is very very difficult to see a decrease in shiping rates before Christmans and New Eyer consumer frenzy

So, Q3 and Q4 net income will be higher than Q2 

How much is the projected PER if we extend Q2 net income for Q3 and Q4? (and please, remember I'm saying Q3 and Q4 will be a lot higher than Q2, but do the math to see what im trying to expose)

PER projected = 1,76

Next step

Taking into account that we agreed Q3 and Q4 will be better than the last ones, I propose to do a better projection, where Q3 will be Q2x1,5. And Q4 will be the same as Q3

why x1,5? Is it clear that freight quotation in Q2 is below 5000, and Q3 average is 7500 (7500/5000 = 1,5)

PER projected = 1,37

**...The last one...**

We can clearly see how Q4 freights start above Q3 maximum levels, right? Around 10k per 40ft container

And trust me, freights are not going to decrease before Christmas.

The average rate for q3 is $7500 per container and will be $10.000 for Q4. That's a +33%

So, how much is going to be the PER if we use Q1, Q2, Q3 as Q2x1,5 and Q4 as Q3x1,33

PER projected = 1,25

&amp;#x200B;

Can you see that no body should be worried about the freight prices in 2022? Even if they fall 50%, ZIM could be still one of the cheapest companies in the market. And im not considering the increase in gross margin either

Which are my predictions for freight rates in 2022?

I dont think they will remain at these levels for all 2022, but Im not projecting a big decrease. Mostly because there will not be any vessels delivered until 2022. First of them will be starting to circulate in 2023. So, supply wont increase.

&amp;#x200B;

The only fact that could slow down $ZIM performance is the stake that $DB and $DAC have on it. $DB is already 1Bilion profit from his convertible debt bought it in 2016 in ZIM when was in financial troubles.

* After corporate earnings, good hiring data, and a covid treatment breakthrough boosted optimism in the world's largest economy, US equities crept higher, with the S&amp;P 500 recording its longest winning run since 2017. The value of the dollar and treasuries decreased.
* For the eighth session in a row, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.1% powered by energy producers and materials, as investors flocked into firms that profit the most from a healthy economy. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 plummeted, weighed down by Tesla Inc.'s 4.9% drop after Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock, to which they responded positively.
* Last week's news flow, which included the passing of a $550 billion infrastructure bill, washed away concerns that high inflation and the Federal Reserve's intention to reduce asset purchases would disrupt economy. The results of Pfizer Inc.'s viral therapy, as well as the easing of US travel restrictions, have fueled anticipation that corporations will continue to report excellent earnings.
* However, the recent rate of increases may make it difficult for stocks to move much higher in the absence of a new trigger.
* On Wednesday, markets will be watching a measure of US consumer pricing intently after advances in US payrolls last week revealed an increase in average hourly earnings.
* Oil fell to $82 a barrel in New York after the United States suggested it may reveal measures to lower oil and gasoline costs as soon as this week. Meanwhile, European gas and power costs have risen on fears that Russia may not fulfill the supply boost promised by Putin.
* In Europe, the Stoxx 600 remained almost unchanged.

1,"11/09/2021, 08:35:13",A couple of pairs worth watching [AMAT/SNPS; PANW/CRWD/ZS],BDRBDRBDR,"One of the things I love watching for is trades within sectors that I know somewhat, where one or two businesses report earnings, followed (over a period of one or more trading days) by other businesses in the same sector. On earnings, stocks in the same sector tend to all fall or rise together (e.g., UBER, LYFT) absent some sort of significant differentiating factor that comes in during the earnings report or in the guidance, unless there are clear signs that market share is definitely being taken away from one player to the benefit of another (e.g., AMD, INTC). 

Take Lyft and Uber. Lyft reports before Uber, generally, so a positive report and guidance for Lyft (which is much smaller, lacking a global footprint and certain businesses Uber has) generally results in Uber shares rising the day after Lyft reports (assuming, of course, that Lyft rises as a result of the positive report and guidance). The same generally occurs when Lyft stock drops on account of a negative report and/or guidance- Uber drops, unless people are counting heavily on different business lines shoring up Uber's balance sheet and earnings for some reason. Occasionally you might get some decoupling because, for example, a pandemic forces large international markets into lockdown while the U.S. remains open, but, for the most part, the pattern holds. (Just don't expect to hold Uber up to and past its earnings date based solely on how LYFT did!)  


By contrast, an earnings report and guidance that lifts AMD does not always lift Intel. AMD and Intel's offerings come about as close to direct substitutes as one can get; in the PC and server markets, we basically have a duopoly.

So let's take those out of the picture, shall we?

Applied Materials reports next week. I am long AMAT (LEAPS long) because I believe there's a secular trend of increasing CapEx for semiconductor manufacturing equipment (built by the likes of AMAT) that is supported by the massive supply chain shortage plus the movement of manufacturing facilities out of countries like China, plus the metaverse, obviously. (The last factor is more psychological than anything at the moment, but it's clearly material to investors who pumped up every semiconductor manufacturer in the universe last week.) What I am not inclined to do is to gamble on AMAT earnings at this point, as the date is too close, and 90 percent of the run-up has already occurred, which leaves me to (more likely than not) be IV crushed. Plus, there are some significant negative catalysts standing between today and the earnings date. But there is a higher margin business in the same sector as AMAT that reports much later.

Synopsys owns a lot of IP in the semiconductor space, and does silicon design and verification work, silicon manufacturing design, and software security assessment/validation work. In short, SNPS does all the things one would need in an environment where AMAT and all of the other semiconductor manufacturers prosper. Good guidance and earnings reports in the coming days from the likes of AMAT and NVDA should prove a boost to SNPS stock in the days following earnings reports for AMAT and NVDA; bad news should have the opposite effect. For the reasons I state above, once I complete my own DD I am likely to run with SNPS longs that I hold through earnings (SNPS reports in December). 

&amp;#x200B;

The same goes for the cybersecurity space, where Palo Alto Networks reports the week of 11/18, followed in a couple of weeks' time by Crowdstrike and ZScaler, which are all pure-play cybersecurity stocks. 

The point is to own/short the later-reporting stock (or options in the underlying) next week so that you benefit from the sympathetic rise/fall that occurs when the earlier-reporting company reports its earnings and guidance next week. Don't bother acquiring them this week because retail starts reporting next week and that's liable to tank everything as the numbers and guidance will be depressing from all but the most well-prepared retailers. 

Additionally, you probably don't want to own a whole lot of anything (longs) past November 9, either. Why? Inflation numbers for October get reported on 11/10 before open, and if they are anything but low AF, stocks likely will see a shock as a result. At a minimum, give it a few days before jumping back in.

P.S. If the AMAT/SNPS interplay appeals to you, NVDA's earnings report and guidance are worth watching for a similar sympathetic change. NVDA reports 11/17, the day before AMAT on 11/18. Any indication that NVDA is ramping up production, getting additional contracts for metashit, or is less dependent on cryptominers than it is on gamers will all benefit NVDA and (to a lesser extent) will pump up AMAT. But again, I think the odds of the market tanking (not a correction, but enough to cost you serious money if you are highly leveraged) after the 11/10/2021 October inflation report and/or depressing reports/guidance from retail are high enough that you should wait until closer to NVDA's earnings date to try this out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpri9s/a_couple_of_pairs_worth_watching_amatsnps/

1,"11/09/2021, 07:23:21",HIMX is a bargain,Frankelstner,"Himax is a fabless semi based in Taiwan. Yes, Taiwan, very sorry, but hear me out. Let's check some financials.

- Lowest PE in the semi sector: https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_semiconductors&amp;o=pe In case you are anxious because it's barely cheaper than Intel, no worries. The latest earnings are not included yet. The actual PE is 5.8.
- Lowest forward PE: https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_semiconductors&amp;o=forwardpe
- Third lowest price per free cash flow: https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_semiconductors&amp;o=pfcf Once again, the latest earnings are not included yet. HIMX is actually at 4.7 here.

So we can see a reasonable gap to other semis, with about 150% upside to be as unprofitable as plays like MU.

A decent amount of share price depression is expected due to the Taiwan situation, so let's check some Taiwanese chip plays (traded only in Taiwan, hence not tracked by finviz):

- Mediatek: PE of 16.
- Realtek: PE of 21.
- Novatek: PE of 8.81. In terms of business, Novatek is fairly close to Himax. Both produce display drivers (the chip that controls a display).
- HIMX (2 quarters ago): PE of 21.

While Taiwanese PEs are not exactly comparable to AMD or NVDA, Himax (right now) is just on a whole other level. Even Novatek shows over 50% upside for HIMX. Novatek also guided down their earnings for next quarter, whereas HIMX expects earnings to increase.

The main difference between HIMX and Novatek is that HIMX managed to secure some fairly lucrative automotive deals. HIMX commands 33% of the global market for automotive displays, which makes it the largest player. The most important piece of technology here is called TDDI (Touch and Display Driver Integration) which is a single chip that both draws images on the display but also accepts touch input.

TDDIs are a hot topic because they improve/simplify the electronics quite a bit. Anyway, Novatek and some other big players lost the TDDI race pretty hard. HIMX was the first and followed by Synaptics (SYNA) shortly after. Both companies see lots of growth due to being firstcomers.

In particular, the automotive market will ensure long-term revenue. From a previous SYNA earnings call:

- ""Given the rapid increase in automotive revenue, could you discuss whether those design wins are locked in for the duration of the vehicle platforms?""

- ""Yes. Let me start with automotive. I mean I think just like any provider in automotive, once you get in, you're pretty much locked in for the duration of the design. So certainly, our visibility is a longer visibility in that business than in any other businesses that we participate.""

Latecomers like Novatek will have a hard time getting a foothold. Both SYNA and HIMX expect automotive displays to be their largest revenue driver in 2022. The main reason that SYNA is not quite as good an opportunity is that it has fewer employees, less revenue and 30% of the earnings of HIMX. And five times the market cap. 

While the chip shortage will be over at some point, these locked-in automotive deals ensure excellent earnings for years to come. As an aside, there is almost no capacity going online in 2022, so the shortage cannot be resolved before 2023. The capacity upgrades in early 2023 might be sufficient to resolve it, though it's too early to tell.

So fundamentals are rock solid. What's not so great is the price action. Ever since the Q2 earnings, HIMX has been on a down trend. The past 3 weeks might be an upward channel, but it's hard to tell. I believe the largest driver of the recent price action is due to increasing short interest. Let's take a look at short interest history:

- April 15: Q1 earnings were pre-announced. The quarter was as profitable as the most profitable year in the past. Short interest went up.
- May 14 / May 28: Short interest went up fourfold in the past 4 weeks because Covid happened in Taiwan.
- June 15: Covid in Taiwan is under control. Short interest remains almost the same. Wait what?
- August 13: Q2 earnings happened. The quarter was 65% more profitable than Q1. Short interest went up.
- October 15: Latest short interest report. About 23% of float is shorted. 11 days to cover.

Combine this price pressure with a high amount of retail ownership (about 50%) and you get lots of paperhands. Anyway, the short interest ensures that shares are really cheap right now. It's a solid stock with a dividend of 15%-20% of the current share price (most likely in June 2022), and a strong floor of $10 (share price is currently $10.95).

These random dudes decided to give it a downgrade and short some shares premarket to cause a scare, the bulls bought and then they decided to open one short position that was huge af so it shook it down a lot and now were here. They could have already closed or will close tomorrow unless they were tipped by an insider which like tbh if the insiders had bad news why tf are they buying and not just waiting for the cheaper price lol.

*Processing img z2watlh9fgy71...*

Generally speaking banks/groups give upgrades/downgrades after they established their positions or when they want to establish positions. so to sum this up, a downgrade means one of two things.

1. They shorted on Friday and wanted free FUD money before ER comes (would close today or tomorrow if so)
2. They wanted a discount to open positions pre ER

***Why the downgrade is manipulative and non genuine:***

Its pretty much the same story HSBC used when downgrading and the same story the dudes themselves used to lower the guidance while buying up millions of shares. The story is ""oh no labor shortage and inflation."" these are temporary things and are impacting the entire sector yet the entire sector is beating earnings by large margins. A downgrade this close before an ER is 100% manipulative for one of the two reasons above, they either needed to close a position before getting fucked or wanted to open a position up. The downgrade also came right after a thanksgiving survey and new donut holiday release announcement which is bullish so I think they rushed off to downgrade offset the news and close positions but thats just a theory.

***Additional DD:***

While scrolling through the ER Q2 report I noticed that they had hired workers (worker shortage shouldn't be reflected in Q3) and those carried extra costs along with opening new operating sites for their new model. These were all one time costs which is all the more reason to be optimistic about Q3, the only bad thing I noticed was when the dude answering questions says they covered the worker expansion but they are facing headwinds regarding the product end of things which could mean a million things from not having enough donut production to high costs and inflation to lower than expected return on investment regarding all the new workers. I don't think it is sales simply because as covered by my last DD this should be a strong quarter, Its more than likely in reference to inflation in which case they raised their donut prices and had lots of optimistic things to say in Q2 regarding Q4 expectations especially with their new model so I think if that end is disappointing that the Q4 guidance will be bullish. I think its really hard for them to blow it unless they intentionally do it but I see no reason for that since most insider buying did take place while Q3 was taking place so it would make no sense for them to sink their own ship. If anything they hid optimism during Q2 so they can buy shares before Q3 and Q4 earnings reports. I think they are low balling Q3 estimates on purpose I stated in my previous DD just so they can get one of those giga earnings beat causing a massive stock price surge. They wanted IPO at $21-$24 and only got $17 so even if I was in shares I wouldn't sell under $20 since I doubt they would as shown by their actions. I think they want to pump it to $20 so they can get the price they wanted before selling shares but when that is can be anyones guess, im just making a bet that i fancy here.

***The story behind my new positions:***

After realizing that making 10k would change my life but so will losing my savings of 1k, so now i only have 5 contracts of the $15c 11/19 instead of the 40ish contracts I had before. I got them for 0.32 each since I have technical analysis and managed to time the very bottom in the day. The reason they are 11/19 is because I strongly believe in my DD and i think the EPS will come around 0.15 but I realized that if that one shorter was tipped off by an insider I would be fucked pretty hard. So instead of 10k, the goal is now 2k which would be possible if it reaches $20, heck I think id make more lol but lets not get greedy. Its hard to time news down to the day or down to the quarter but im pretty optimistic about my DD but I cant afford to lose anymore money hence this time around im taking my trades a little more seriously. My goal is to make 5-10k by december, currently sitting on $850. I have a few other plays lined up that im also optimistic about but just waiting to time them well, those will mostly be technical analysis mixed with DD mostly TA though.

Red Button Yall! Mr Burns= Ken Griffin? The bar Jim Cramer likes? It seems pretty humorous IMO the correlation between the Simpsons and Jim Cramer.          

Has anyone noticed how Jim Cramer had a sibling or family member in a high position in politics? Was Jim Cramers rise including from the J&amp;J trade strictly from insider trading? A lot of things about Jim Cramer point to insider trading imo People should also consider looking into who I believe is his daughter who goes by Carley Garner(I believe her real name is Carley Cramer). https://decarleytrading.com Carley tends to be right about direction from the plays ive noticed but always recommends selling 2 calls and buying 1call which ends up leaving you in a short position once it rockets past the call youve sold. It has been pretty consistent to the point where I follow her plays directionally but will not sell calls as I understand the volatility in the plays she recommends. I believe she is trying to suppress the price of cheap call options so that when the commodity she recommends(usually oil and bonds) skyrockets, market makers literally compound money at unprecedented levels(imagine buying a call for .05 and selling at $4 on a consistent basis). I believe that is the very thing Carley Cramer, Jim Cramer and Market Makers are taking part of. As the saying goes, the apple doesnt fall far from the tree.          

If anyone has ever taken financial advice from Jims Twitter account, please consider filing a suit against his charity as well as his person as he promotes his charity on his Twitter page and it would likely leave him vulnerable to lawsuits for lack of proper disclosures relating to business practices(charities are a business).

One example of real world demands that I can think of is direct trading properties and cars with krypto or making means of monetizing or creating passive income off of them utilizing defi protocols with secure smart contracts that don't have high level of corruption that the current corrupt prone system has.

With keeping that in mind I researched and found about [futurent](https://futurent.io/) , which actually does the most close to what I just described , going through the whitepaper , I found there is this fractionalized nft concept as well , which they claim to use to peg the ownership of a property or car that's being rented to distribute the earned money to the holders based on how much portion they hold which is pretty insane.

Ex dividend date Nov. 11th (buy by then to get div.)
Trading price $10.20
Div value $1.25 a share.
Dec 17 10P 0.57

Every 100 shares you buy at $10.20, you get $125 in div. And you can secure $10 sell for $57.

So... Even if price drops below $10 after div payout:

-$20 per 100 shares
-$57 per 1 put to secure sell
+$125 per 100 shares in div

= Guaranteed $48 profit per 100 shares.

Great hedge huh?

Anyways, Long story short, after seeing how little effect the Elon Musk news really took on Tesla, and how they began to upgrade it again and release news to purposely hold the stock up - in other words heavily manipulate it. (Apart from the heavy bull cult.) I decided to close my short position, although I don't believe I am wrong. I still stick to my thesis. I simply see a safer and much higher return with Alibaba options. Plus, Alibaba is right up the ally of my Circle Of Competence. When I started shorting Tesla, Alibaba had its little run-up that I couldn't foresee at the time going down. So, when I saw Alibaba head right back down it was an opportunity I couldn't pass upon. At the end of the day, I am here to make money not to be ""right"" so I don't mind if any of you laugh or find my switch funny. I would not say I was scared off, or panicked. Not at all, I simply see a way better opportunity. I made 10-minute private audio below explaining it a little more.

** Stats:** I took a roughly -$16K loss about a -4% closing my Tesla short position. The money was then used to buy more of my Alibaba calls ($200 calls for April). I strongly believe I'll be very grateful I made this change/adjustment.  Aiming for a 30% dip on Tesla VS a 2X-3x gain on Alibaba, no brainer change.

We all know inflation is a thing by now and if we don't keep it under control asset prices will skyrocket with the same rate they have since march 2020. My professor for financial economics once told us that after index prices double they're due for a crash but before that they might just double again. Spy is up around 100% from its lows in 2020. If this continues it's very likely to double before jan2024 to a price of 940$. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, volume on the furthest OTM calls for that expiry was &gt;5000 according to nasdaq and it makes sense: an investment of only 10k into these options turns into 1.32 Mio$ if spy doubles. Spy only has to go to 886$ for a 1Mio payday. even though its retarded as fuck this is a good Risk/reward for me. So I bought 60 calls at 1.65. even had to call my broker because these options are too retarded to list online lol. will update screenshot once it's thru.

**1. Invacare Corporation (NYSE:IVC)**

Invacare is one of the penny stocks we discussed late last week. No new updates have come out this week; however, that hasnt stopped the steady climb that IVC stock has experienced over the previous few sessions. Ever since dropping at the start of November, the companys shares have managed to claw back some of what was lost.

One of the biggest triggers for the drop was the companys short-term outlook based on a recent earnings update. But the most significant factor came when IVC shares were booted from the S&amp;P SmallCap 600. NetScout Systems took its place.

Invacare had some positives to consider. These are some things that I think have become a core focus for the market heading into the rest of the year. The medical equipment manufacturing company expects continued growth. Specifically, CEO Matthew Monaghan said, Similar to the second quarter, we continue to experience strong order intake and high demand for our products, resulting in a higher-order backlog compared to pre-pandemic levels. These favorable trends give us the confidence we will achieve sequential improvement in 4Q21, finishing the year on a strong note and building momentum as we head into 2022.

Based on data from Fintel, today, IVC stock shows a short float percentage of just over 31%.

**2. Romeo Power Inc. (NYSE:RMO)**

With the infrastructure bill excitement over the weekend, several industries have begun trending in the stock market today. One of these is energy, and Romeo Power has benefited so far. The company specializes in battery development for electric vehicle manufacturers. With the likes of Tesla ([**NASDAQ:TSLA**](https://pennystocks.com/ticker/?symbol=TSLA)) and other EV companies gaining a spotlight today, ancillary companies, including battery manufacturers and even charging station stocks, are gaining ground.

Next week, the company is also set to report third-quarter earnings. If RMO stock is on your watch list right now, keep November 15 in mind. Romeos results come after the close, with a corporate conference call to follow.

As far as RMO being one of the short squeeze[penny stocks to watch](https://pennystocks.com/category/penny-stocks-watch-list/), Fintel data shows a short float percentage of just under 23% as of this article. With increasing attention on EV and alternative energy stocks, RMO could be on the watch list today.

**3. Electrameccanica Vehicles Corp (NASDAQ:SOLO)**

Similar to Romeo Power, Electrameccanica has also gained momentum. The company is building its portfolio of electric vehicles designed for urban travel and short-term trips. Its single-driver SOLO vehicles have just begun rolling off the assembly line and out for delivery.

Earlier this month, Zongshen Industrial Group exercised 1.4 million warrants at a CAD$4 strike price, equating to CAD$5.6 million in proceeds for the company.

**We strongly believe in ElectraMeccanicas mission, and the groundbreaking SOLO EV, with this warrant exercise, is a clear testament to our confidence in the Companys future and the value we place on our mutual relationship.**

*Zongshen Industrial Group Chairman Zuo*

This week, the company attends the Stifel 2021 Midwest One-on-One Growth Conference. If SOLO stock is on your list right now, keep November 11 in mind. This is the date of the conference. Attention on EVs and renewable right now may give more reason to have some names on a watch list. In the case of SOLOs short float percentage, Fintel data shows that sitting around 17% right now.

**4. Meta Meterials Inc. (NASDAQ:MMAT)**

Shares of MMAT have steadily climbed over the last few weeks. A mix of interest in renewable energy, including solar, some confusion on its name, and some actual crossover into new tech has put the company on the radar. Meta Materials has myriad technology applications. Everything from designing solar energy solutions to its more recent focus on the Metaverse, theres a lot to look at when it comes to MMAT.

Most recently, the company took part in an online panel discussion. It was titled AR Eyewear Engineering Challenges, and the Role Advanced Optical Materials Could Play and included some of the foremost names in this new niche. Stanford University, Tilt Five, Facebook Reality Labs, Microsoft / Hololens, Covestro, and META, topped the list.

This week with a mix of interest in renewable energy and metaverse technology, it makes sense why MMAT stock is gaining some attention. Those whore searching for penny stocks with higher short interest may have also come across the company. According to Fintel, MMATs short float percentage sits around 15.4%.

**5. Senseonics Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SENS)**

Finally, Senseonics Holdings rounds out this list of penny stocks. Since the end of October, it has been on our radar for stocks to watch with higher short interest. The company specializes in medical technology, specifically its Eversense platform for blood glucose monitoring

Aurora Innovation Inc.'s stock see-sawed in early trading Thursday after merging with a blank-check company run by LinkedIn co-founder [Reid Hoffman](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/search/results?q=Reid%20Hoffman) and Zynga founder [Mark Pincus](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/search/results?q=Mark%20Pincus).

The self-driving vehicle technology business finished the day at $9.60 a share (Nasdaq:AUR), about 3% below where the blankc check company it merged with finished its last day of trading on Wednesday. That gave it a market cap of about $12.5 billion, up from a valuation of about $10 billion it had after a venture round last December.

Aurora is emerging from its combination with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners Y (Nasdaq:RTPY) with about $1.8 billion in gross proceeds from the deal and cash on its books. That's below the $2.5 billion that was projected, mostly due to the large number of the SPAC's shares that were refunded before the merger closed.

The company made Pittsburgh its headquarters several months ago, dropping the dual headquarters setup it has been operating under in which Mountain View was the other location. But two of its three founders  CEO [Chris Urmson](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/search/results?q=Chris%20Urmson) and President [Sterling Anderson](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/search/results?q=Sterling%20Anderson)  remain in Silicon Valley and say they have no plans to move.

Aurora said it plans to use the infusion of new capital to further fund the commercial launch of its Aurora Horizon and the Aurora Connect self-driving subscription services for trucking carriers and ride-hailing fleets, respectively.

Aurora Horizon is expected to launch in 2023 and Aurora Connect is planned for 2024. Both will be powered by the Aurora Driver  the company's name for its fully autonomous self-driving software and hardware capabilities and the data services that come with it, which had its beta version released last week.

""Today marks a significant milestone for Aurora and the self-driving industry as we revolutionize transportation  making it safer, increasingly accessible, and more reliable and efficient than ever before,"" Urmson said in a press release on Thursday

INOVIO (NASDAQ: INO) has signed a non-binding MOU with the Ministry of Health and Social protection of Columbia, showing its intentions to advance initiatives to combat the pandemic and thereat COVID-19 poses and better plan for future public health emergencies.

INOVIO partners with Columbian government on COVID-19 vaccine initiatives 

The MOU establishes a framework for partnership in which the company and the government will look into knowledge exchange, tech licensing, and capacity building to help Colombia develop and produce vaccines and other biopharmaceuticals. The development of local manufacturing capabilities for INOVIOs DNA medicines and related products and technology could be among the outcomes of the collaboration.

CEO and President Joseph Kim said, INOVIOs memorandum of understanding with Colombia is a sign of our shared commitment to develop and advance potentially life-saving DNA medicines and vaccines to those in need. This partnership grew out of the intended advantages of INOVIOs DNA medicines platform to address current and future global health threats due to the anticipated stability of its product candidates, speed of design and manufacture, as well as the immune response and tolerability that have been observed to date in clinical trials.

Columbia completes cycle to start vaccine production 

Columbias Health and Social Protection Minister, Dr. Fernandi Ruiz Gomez, said, Today is very special for us. We have a complete circle of what is possible with a North American company for the production of vaccines, including the possibility of integrating the work being carried out by the WHO Solidarity vaccine trial in Colombia that includes INOVIO as one of the four vaccine candidates in the clinical studies. As we discussed in the previous meeting today, the possibility of moving forward quickly is due to INOVIO considering Colombia as a priority country, a gesture that we appreciate, and is indicative of the will of our country and the Ministry of Health to advance the development of vaccines in Colombia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpkunx/inovio_ino_signs_mou_to_collaborate_with/

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11TGVGYGz04pJvC7vutW_6mRcpCqxn3ROs6P_T41DqLc/edit?usp=sharing

Most of it applies to only 3/Y because they're the vast majority of production, but I did throw in some S/X profit estimates on one line.

Demand is just unbelievable right now. On the earnings call in October, CFO Zach ""Master of Coin"" Kirkhorn called it a ""profound awakening"" that ""caught us off guard"". Well guess what: we ain't seen nothin yet.

3/Y ASP as of today is probably at least $58k already, judging by US configurator prices on tesla.com although probably it is less in China and some of this may already reflect expectations of the tax credit.

M3 RWD is $45k

M3 LR is $51k

M3 Performance is $59k

MY LR is $58k

MY Performance is $63k

Note that these are only the base prices for standard options for paint color, interior color, wheels, and seating configuration, each of which can add $1-2k extra.

Model Y is going to be nearly all of what Berlin and Austin produce in Q4 '22 and probably most of the increased production in Shanghai. Y costs the same as 3 to produce but sells for more $$$.

It also remains to be seen how long the US govt would be willing to continue subsidizing Teslas like has been proposed but it does seem likely for next year at least.

And then, the Hertz order. What's the conversion rate of fresh meat taking the bait on a Tesla test ride and then wanting one and following through on placing an order? Wild guess, 20%. People literally warn their friends and family not to test drive one unless they're prepared to compulsively empty their wallet to buy. If Hertz gives out 3 million extended test drives to Tesla virgins next year, that's 600k new orders at current prices. Plus, other rental car companies will see the popularity and multiply this with 10^5 scale orders of their own.

Furthermore, we're likely going to have Tom Brady advertising Teslas during NFL games for the rest of the season.

Cybertruck, in all its big shiny triangular all-American glory, is going to begin hitting the streets in the USA starting around August, sparking wild curiosity amongst the millions of Americans who have no idea what Tesla's really about. Early Cybertruck owners will not be able to walk across the parking lot without getting questions.

Oil price rises and volatility further increase interest in buying EVs. The UK ran out of petrol for a while this year. Here in Seattle, gas prices are over $4/gallon.

Shipping in 2021 is very expensive, and the EU charges 10% import tariffs. Tesla hit 30.5% gross margin last quarter with only factories in California and China. There's obvious guaranteed cost saving in opening Giga Berlin plus some logistics cost savings from Giga Austin for eastern North America.

As far as manufacturing cost savings go, Tesla has many innovations queued up that simply need to be scaled as well as more that we don't know about encapsulated in the miscellaneous improvements line of the spreadsheet. This model also does not account for any significant 4680 cost savings in 2022. Their rate of innovation is unparalleled. Watch this if you don't believe me.

As we have highlighted previously, not all transformations are linear and there is always the potential for a short-term pullback in executing the plan. We expect the operational pause will lead to marketplace skepticism and question the success of the long-term plan. The company has had some near-term challenges from weaker store traffic related to Covid-19 delta variants impact along with rising supply chain and transportation costs. However, we disagree with the marketplace view that these headwinds will continue to overwhelm the significant ongoing improvements that management is making to the core operations. We very much like the new CEO and his additions to his management team  strong executives with significant transformation experience. As the new initiatives further rollout over the coming quarters, we expect to see further improvement in future operating trends. Management is in the process of rolling out 8-10 owned brands, which should drive margin expansion and dramatically enhance the overall business model. Store brands are 1,000 basis points higher gross margin than national brands, and as they move from 10% to 30% of sales, they should become a significant positive profit contributor and help management achieve their long-term gross margin target of 38%. Bed Bath also continues to have a very strong balance sheet ($10/share in cash), and has been using non-core asset sales to complete a very accretive share buyback program (likely greater than 20% of the float by year-end). With the recent pullback, we see some similarities to GameStop early in their turnaround as the company aggressively reduced their shares outstanding (&gt;30%) ahead of revenue stability and profit improvement. We believe success on Bed Baths transformation plan should see profits double over the next couple of years and should lead to significantly higher normalized earnings and free cash flow per share. At an enterprise value to revenue under .2x, we believe Bed Bath remains at a significant discount to its intrinsic value.*

(source:[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/09/133\_315413.html](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/09/133_315413.html))

They are so good in fact at making displays that earlier this year their biggest competitor, Samsung, decided to buy their displays because they were better. The highest quality OLED panels you see on the market today are all LG.([https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375179/samsung-electronics-lg-display-oled-tv-panels-quantum-dot-qd](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375179/samsung-electronics-lg-display-oled-tv-panels-quantum-dot-qd)) 

* Heavily undervalued at $8.6 with an eps of 2.24. Just look at that Value 
* Revenue growth of 7.2% in Q3
* Q4 expected will boost sales on the back of strong shipment volumes estimated at +10%
* Expansion with a new factory in Vietnam

Big volume and some 30-50% up. Has 61M users already, cares more about what users think than about PC BS, and 1 in 3 communities in US is already there. 

Ever since FB, TWT, and others got under scrutiny, the market was waiting for a new concept of social media. 

Some hate fake profiles and trolls, some hate PC censorship, etc. 

Now Nextdoor caters for pple that want a social network that would make their community safer, friendlier and more connected. 

Politics have their own place and you get in to that only if you really want to. 

Now my question is: Can $KIND fly as DWAC did? Where would you put your money between them or even between FB, TWT, KIND?

Hi guys how are you?

I'm Thomas, 24 years old guy from North Italy.

I wanted to touch on an issue that has tormented me in recent months .. We are talking about community, we have been talking about the good of others for almost a year with this covid and this vaccine that they are forcing to do.

Well I did, I got vaccinated against my will, not because I am a no vax (I have almost all the vaccines), not for the community but simply to be able to go to work and to be able to support myself ..

These are tough months, I don't leave home, I don't have money, I work every day and I can't do a second job because for the Italian state if you do one job you are taxed at 38%, if you do two then at 70% .. practically work for free ..

I have a disastrous economic situation, not for smoking, not for alcohol, not for gambling but simply because I have trusted this country, worked and worked for my company without ever receiving anything in return .. I have no hope for this country and they talk to me about community.


They talk about community, but they are the first to sell their grandmother's furniture for  30 to the black boy who has just landed.

they talk about community but what interests them is only their report ..


I am an electromechanical technician, I have knowledge of plc software and programming. and nothing, I can't save  200 a month ..

My parents practically threw me into the abyss, I have a rent of  550 a month, a loan of  400 for a car that barely runs.

and then they talk to me about community.

I've seen communities in gaming in the past, I've seen communities in the stock world, but I haven't seen communities outside of a screen.


I have no money, I am willing to work hours on hours, to do anything to get out of this situation but I cannot do it, because the state does not allow it. Italy is not America unfortunately ..

Just think that here they give money if you don't work, and if you work too much instead of rewarding you they tell you to pay more taxes, because you know, you can.

I can not go out with friends, I have forbidden myself anything and the thing that makes me feel the worst of all is that in all this there is also my girlfriend, who continues to stay by my side beyond every difficulty ... ( she studies)

I probably suffer from depression, I have sold all my possessions, I have practically nothing left and no one has ever asked me if I wanted a hand.


Where is the community? the same one who wanted everyone to get vaccinated for the common good, but the same one that if I ask for an evening job, she won't give it to me because I already work during the day?


I am disgusted by this country, really and I can't wait to leave .. I want to leave.


If anyone needs any remote work I can do, even for a minimal wage I am available.

I am an electromechanical technician, I speak 2 languages in addition to Italian (English and Spanish), I know plc programming. I do online courses every single day to learn something. I want to get out from this situation. I dont want to ask free money, i just want to do something and get something back. I'm available for everything!! Text me, i will let you my contact.

I don't know how to get out of this situation, and the community has just put one foot on my head and wants me to be under it.

If you need anything, please contact me, I would appreciate it.

Thank you all, and I hope that the term community here comes close to its real meaning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpk1bd/help_me/

*Now rank-ordered to highlight the most under-valued companies (higher on the list = more under-valued).*

&amp;#x200B;

[if there are any numbers that look off, post a source and I will update. these projections change frequently](https://preview.redd.it/zgyj4qle0fy71.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=429c61df0bef9d0b76d3390d11d5482e645c9641)

**INTERPRETING THE CHART**

**Lower values** on the EV / (EH/s) metrics implies the company is *under-valued* and there is opportunity for it to increase in value. The more extreme the discrepancy, the greater potential for a price increase.

**For example, if a company is trading at 1/3 the Average EV / (EH/s) that would imply the possibility for a 3x increase in price**  assuming valuations became normalized on that metrics.

&amp;#x200B;

**UNDERSTANDING MINER VALUATION**

Valuing miners on a relative basis comes down to 4 things:

(a) How much they can mine

(b) How expensive it costs them to mine

(c) Expected growth in mining capability

And lastly

(d) How much the company is currently valued at

Put succinctly, if you can find some that currently is and will be producing large amounts for RELATIVELY a relatively low cost for the company  then that is an opportunity for growth. Production capacity is measured by hash rate. In this case EH/s or Exahash per second. The primary determinant of cost is electricity. And the value of a company is enterprise value (not share price, not market cap).

So when we normalize on these by calculating EV / (EH/s)  this should pretty clearly flag the appealing stocks in this sector. The results speak for themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpjvci/miner_valuation_chart_updated_20211108_cifr_hut/

1,"11/09/2021, 02:15:33",The Silverback Batman of GME.,Taduolis," Imagine being a guy who loves people. Loves people to an extent where you start putting aside your personal gain for a tiny bit of smile on a random strangers face. So it happens that you are also smart and this combination at one time in your life brings wealth and prosperity, because these two qualities of yours just work that well. It seems that you have achieved everything and can go do whatever the heck you want for the rest of your life. But entering life or high prosperity opened your eyes to see how exceptional and unusual your way of thinking is. You realise that almost everybody around you who hoards crazy wealth does not have the same attitude as you. They do not care about the smile on other people's faces. They do not care about people who are stuck in an endless loop of not having a space to breathe or choose how to live their life. All they care about is hoarding wealth. No matter the actions, no matter the consequences.  They think they are on the top of the world. They have all the powers to create a system that allows them to work their ways. And it torments you. It makes you angry from the moment you open your eyes in the morning till you rest your head on the pillow in the evening.. You entered a life of so-called success and you see that so many other successful people do not love the life the way you do. Its painful. You live with guilt until it clicks Can I do something about it?. You feel the urge to try. You start scouting. You look for loopholes. You look for loopholes in their systems just the way they look for ways to create them. You spend so much time looking and searching. Until it's there. You see a glitch in their ways where in some crazy mega unlikely circumstances would break their ways. I can do something about it. You start reverse engineering. It takes time. You think and think and put one step at a time after another and there. You have it. You have a plan that might just change the world a tiny bit and make it a better place for everybody. And you know - you have the resources. You could be the batman

Its time to act. You find a company that has an insane personal value to the same people this world is abolishing. It is one of many targets your enemy has. But this one is special. This is the one to work on. You get in quite easily BECAUSE it is beaten to the ground. You get the team, you get into position. You start working on the strategies which are directly against your enemies strategies. You pay no attention to the outside world and just focus on what you do best. You just love your customers. Focus. No dancing. You do your work. And then the inevitable happens. Your work gets spotted by the same crowd that loves NOW YOUR company. Only one fellow can spot what you are doing and it will spread like a virus. You knew this was going to happen. Because sooner or later people find out if you stand out. And the bubble pops. You are a star. Your enemy knows what you are up to. But that's the plan, its all in the plan. You stay focused, and play by the rules. The same broken abused rules, just for a different purpose. Maybe you let yourself play a little, throw some nip slips for your people on your side. Just to help them hold the motivation. And you know, you have thought everything through, no mistakes, no ways out. You will prevail. And you do. Step by step, brick by brick, you finally win the fight. And finally you can feel that you did something that probably on a relatively small scale changed the world. But it did. And to the better side. Because of you many families can finally start breathing and enjoying life. You defeated the Evil Enemy. The enemy that was not yours. The enemy of people. You probably made a broken long lasting system fail and be reworked for people. You stopped the ways of injustice. You will be called the closest thing to a Batman a real world had ever had.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We know very little about our SilverBack RC, very little about his moves, thoughts and plans. But this is how I choose to imagine him being. I wish to believe that he is a person who is not using his situation for personal gain. I wish he is a genuinely badass hero who prioritises the well being of the world rather than his own gain. I hope that he came into GameStop for this reason. Because it would be an amazing story. This gives me hope. My wife always doubts if we should bring children to this world because it seems that there are no people who do something for the world but just selfish pricks everywhere. But I want to believe there are. I want her to see the story of RC and have a spark of faith in her heart. 

I truly believe that if this movement goes by the speculationary plan of ours - the world will see many more heroes that finally do have the stupidest thing to make the world a better place - resources. I hope that so many of you dont dream only about lambos, hookers and drugs. I really hope that so many of you by walking down the street and seeing some injustice thought to yourself if only I had money I would fix this shit. And now you will be able to. We are the ones who know what needs to be fixed for a better future. As for me? I have my plan. Since the very first share bought on January 27th and bleeding a day later I tried to stay fresh. After some time and slowly averaging down I saw myself green. Then I started thinking of a plan. I know what I want to fix and it seems that I got it. This will not be as diabolical, remarkable and influential as RC plan, but mine, I hope, will make some lifes better. I will not allow myself to rot in a mansion where I try to avoid faces of peasants. We are the peasants. And only we know that we are the people that make up this world. Dont waste your resources. Enjoy your tendies thoughtfully, but more important HAVE A PLAN. ANT LETS FUCKING SAVE THIS WORLD!!

BUY, HOLD AND SOME GOOD THINGS FOR THE WORLD!

1,"11/09/2021, 01:36:41",Bull case for weed stocks $tlry,sydaust,"Many of you autists have been burned by weed stocks (and have burned weed plants?). Many are bitter bag holders from the 2018 madness. I think your rage is blinding you to the opportunity now. Heres some retarded analysis for you.

Macro:

Global sales of alcohol were $1.5 trillion (with a T) in 2020. Tobacco sales were $760 billion.

Both of those industries have extremely high margins. For example AB InBev gross margins are ~60% and Altria gross margins are about the same.

Pretty much everyone knows that marijuana is more fun and less harmful than either alcohol or tobaccocurrently estimates for sales in the legal cannabis industry are ONLY in the neighborhood of $30-60 billion. Illicit sales are north of $100 billion/year conservatively.

Takeaway: Legal cannabis sales have a huge runway. Its possible that cannabis becomes as large or larger than tobacco eventually. Thats roughly an $800 Billion market. Maybe it can even rival alcohol at $1.5 T. But people are estimating it will only be $30 Billion in 2025? 

Legalization: It will happen. Its wildly popular. The majority of the USA supports it already and that majority gets larger everyday as old Christian pearl clutchers die off. I have no idea when, but its possible the dems get their act together and pass something soon since their popularity is in the shitter.

How do you play it?

Pretty much any decently run cannabis business. I personally like Tilray because it has scale and experience with branding/marketing.

BuT PeOplE cAn gROw thEIr owN wEed for CheAPer!!! 

Yeah, yeah, how many people drink their home brewed beer exclusively? How many grow tobacco plants? You can also illegally download pretty much any Netflix content but that business seems to be fine. Give me a break. Few people want to spend their time getting the pH of the water just right.

Valuation:

Lets assume similar size and margins as tobacco. Thats ~$800B revenue. And at 20% net margins (half of tobacco!), ~$160B profit. If a company like Tilray gets 5% of that pie, thats ~$8B profit/year. At a 10x multiple (very low), that would be an $80B market cap. Its ~$5B today, so 16x upside.

Best of luck retards. Im long Tilray.

TSLA I was bullish and I told if it break to the 1158 it will bounce up strong as it did

AAPL didn't close above the 151 and went down trying to bring buyers

BA see how it almost hit the 228 pre market and went down to bounce from the 222.83

FB I even draw a movement up and reversal down . see how it rejected from the 345.72

SAVA  fail to break the 94 and fall to the 86.5 (basically draw what the stock did)

RBLX still building the reversal so the move hasn't finished yet.

Mr.Belford may have been wrong, but I am not.

I am here today to offer you an opportunity to be part of a company that you will tell your grandkids and great-grandkids about right as you ascend to the stars, for the second time in your life. 

**Polestar(ggpi): A company backed by the true Jordan Belford: Leonardo Dicaprio**

**(**This is real by the way. Mr.Dicaprio is an investor in Polestar**)**

With all this infrastructure bill talk, we have to wonder what companies are going to benefit most. In fact, we have to think about the future, which if anything this year has shown you, is the EV space. Now there are plenty of absolute dumpster-looking EV stocks, many of which will probably not exist in the next few years.

Yes NKLA I'm looking at you

Considering these factors, we have to start to think about companies with actual output. These may include factors you have never heard of such as revenue, or sales, which is common in the EV space. I mean look at LCID right now, valued at nearly $70 billion dollars, having 0 revenue so far. Then look to Rivian, a similar $65 billion valuation. Then look towards companies like NKLA, who will probably never make money, but still have a $5 billion valuation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am here to offer up Polestar. A company with

1) Over $1 billion in revenue.

2) Two beautiful EV cars, planning to bring another 3 into the market.

3) The cheapest EV price tag on the market at a $20 billion dollar valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

Think about it this way. If Polestar gets valued the same as LCID, a company with no sales, your investment of a mere $10,000 could be worth upwards of $30,000. A 200% increase, just if you conservatively compare their valuations. Seems like an easy bet to me.

&amp;#x200B;

A catalyst for this week is the Rivian IPO for $65 billion. We are already seeing a rise in the EV sector. Hop on before you miss the biggest boom since the NKLA SPAC days.

&amp;#x200B;

Would not want to bore you with further details, so here is an in-depth summary of Polestar:

In comparison to many things rocketing in today's market, it has every reason to go up, but for some reason it just keeps grinding down. In situations like this, I find it helpful to use a chart to help determine when the safest entry for long options is, **so you don't get cucked by theta gang.**

Honestly, there's **3** really interesting setups going on here, but from a longer timeframe perspective they can all be considered one. Let's dive in and break it down color by color, so that even a monkey could understand:

[$CRSR 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/4xnd7595mey71.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12d12a5d75568d5a1919d5029b513a5514ea6db9)

In order from shortest timeframe to longest -

**(RED)**

**Broadening Descending Wedge** coming from downside. Normally has a bearish bias, implying the trend is down and should remain down unless broken, but in some cases it can be a reversal pattern. This is especially true when the fundamental story agrees, like in this case.

I haven't gotten to it yet, but obviously there is a similar looking setup just above it in teal. Normally I would look for further price targets on this, but in this situation I'm just assuming the goal of this one in particular is to break through that teal setup.

Note the last three days just chopping around, as long as we are above the setup, this is considered healthy and bullish. Nearest support is **25.50.** Target/breakout point for the teal pattern is **26.80.**

**(TEAL)**

Can be drawn as a **Broadening Descending Wedge** or a **Descending Channel**, both are pretty much the same thing except one has a widening range. Both normally have a bearish bias, but can be reversal patterns.

This is the primary setup I am watching for entry. As stated before, the breakout point is a daily close above **26.80.** From here it would target **28.26, 30.67.** Super strong resistance up there, so it's likely we stall out a bit at that point. After a reversal from a bearish setup, the best case for us is to take a breather and flag out, forming a bullish setup.

If we can do that, the next and final target for that particular setup is this key zone from **34.57 - 35.03**, also the breakout point for our final pattern.

**(PURPLE)**

This is the **Descending Channel** that has been intact basically since IPO. We have to clear **35.03** to break it, and from there the price targets would be **40.95, 42.94.** Keep in mind, the more likely outcome is we reject there, at least short term. A **Descending Channel** means the trend is down until it is broken.

**(YELLOW)**

These are price levels. Support when above, resistance when below:

* **21.87**
* **24.03**
* **25.50**
* **28.26**
* **30.67**
* **34.57 - 35.03**
* **40.95**
* **42.94**

**(POSITION IDEA)**

January **2022 21st 30c** are what I'm looking at when the teal trend breaks. I think they are all relatively cheap compared to what they have been in the past on it's pumps, though.

**(FUNDAMENTAL OVERVIEW)**

Again, we've all heard the FA story from this one before, but if you haven't here is a brief overview:

* **25.7%** 2017-2020 Rev. CAGR
* **2.47B** Market CAP
* **1.7B** 2020 Revenue

**I'm going to make a few arguments and I'm challenging each one of you, if you disagree me, to explain why and post your short position. Talk is cheap my friends. Positions or ban.**

# WISH sells garbage

Yes, and? What's the problem exactly? MCD is selling garbage and you are eating it. WMT sells garbage and you go there every week. AMZN sells garbage (more on this later). Dollar stores sell garbage. NFLX films garbage. People are dumb. They love garbage. Cheap garbage? Even better. WISH sells garbage. We get it. They sell lots of garbage. $2.8 billion worth of garbage!

# Did you ever buy anything on WISH?

Yes I did. I bought a garbage bin and had no issues with it. The product was shipped from Chyna, it was just as described and arrived in 2 weeks, as predicted. Proof: https://twitter.com/SilbergleitJr/status/1450962281865515009

# Beating a dead horse

You see, when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at $2 in January 2021, GME at $5 in August 2020,  there is a point at which there is just no meat left. There is only a bone. You can't short stock into an oblivion. There is nothing left to short! You are running a risk. At some point, the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock. Melvin did not understand this concept and that's why they lost billions. Simple as that.

# WISH is way down since its IPO

Yes exactly. All your favorite growth stocks that you are now buying at all time highs got destroyed during their first year on the market. Don't believe me? [Take a look at FB, SNAP, ETSY.](https://twitter.com/SilbergleitJr/status/1446256776110878723)

# AMZN and WISH sell same stuff

What most of you idiots don't realize is that you can buy the exact same items on WISH instead of AMZN for much less. Bezos is selling you the exact same overpriced Chinese garbage while you complain how WISH is selling garbage. If you don't realize how stupid you are at this point, I'm not sure how to help you.

# WISH local sellers

WISH local pickup model has the potential to become an indexed and searchable city flea market.  Imagine being able to search all those small Chinatown stores in your city! Want a flower pot? Go here. Want a cheap garden hose extension? Go there. This model cuts down significantly on shipping times because WISH just directs you to the nearby store.

# 1Sansome

For those very few of you that have girlfriends, you may have heard of Shein. Shein is a Chinese fast fashion retail that sells - you guessed it - garbage! They are basically a drop shipping business (same as WISH) as they do not produce their own clothing. They ship exclusively from China. Shipping times are longer than Amazon Prime. That did not prevent them to become the largest online-only fashion company in the world! Why am I telling you all this? Because WISH recently launched 1Sansome shopping app that is basically a clone of Shein. Heck, even models are the exact same! Go to both of their websites and you will realize what I'm telling you. They are giving free garbage to Instagram and TikTok hotties to fuel this thing until they become a recognizable name among girls who propelled Shein to the clouds.

I said what I need to say. I put my money where my mouth is. Positions or ban. I'm not afraid to show my red WISH positions because I know ""scared money makes no money"". Before bashing, calling me a pumper, bagholder, share your WISH short positions or GTFO.

1,"11/09/2021, 00:59:47",5 months ago I posted about CLMT. Since then the stock has more than doubled. It's going to double again. Technical Analysis,jdm127x," Disclosure: 50k share at $4.68 avg.

5 months ago I made this Reddit thread ([https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/o0vzuh/clmtthe\_reusable\_energy\_stock\_ready\_for\_take\_off/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/o0vzuh/clmtthe_reusable_energy_stock_ready_for_take_off/))   about the insanely undervalued renewable energy stock CLMT. Since then   the stock has doubled with no signs of slowing down and is on a fast   track to the 20+ price share.

What   has changed since then? Well the company quarterly's continue to   surpass expectations but what looms large is the impending official   announcement of the Montana Deal. What is the Montana deal? The Montana   deal is an incoming partnership that will turn a large portion of its   Great Falls business into renewable feedstock processing. The project is   underway and the renewable manufacturing plant will be commissioned in   the first half of 2022 to process soybean oil feedstock. The end goal  is  to integrate into farm and ranch operations  within Montana for  other  renewable feedstocks. The biggest and most exciting opportunity  to come  out of this new partnership is the goal of renewable diesel.  Analysts  suggest not only will this be massive boon to CLMT share value  and  company value, but many analysts suggest that this Great Falls  plant  posseses the tech to be the single most advanced, efficient and   lucrative renewable energy plant in North America.

Currently   CLMT sits with an estimated 2 billion dollar company valuation. When   the Montana partnership is announced and operations commence, many   analysts suggest the valuation of CLMT could DOUBLE to 4 billion.   Currently CLMT sits at an asking price of roughly $11.90 per share,   making it one of the single best investment options on the market. Not   only will this stock find its way into the 20's, but in my estimation,   CLMT has all the makings of a company heading into the 40-50s per share   price.

CLMT represents the  leading  tech in renewable energy, something  the  future can't avoid.  U.S  targets   2050 bid to wean airlines off fossil fuels. This is the  future  people,   there is no getting away from it. Companies like CLMT  are  going to be ESSENTIAL to these kind of goals. I have been spot on  in  terms of laying out this stocks trajectory. This stock isn't some  stupid  ape company with no real assets that will crash leaving someone  holding  expensive bags. This is a real company with real assets for  those  looking to make an INVESTMENT. CLMT could generate 450-500 in  EBITDA  which would be an absurd cash flow for a market cap of 800M.  Many ape  stocks sell many times that market cap and dont even have  revenue, never  mind cash flow. Despite the success of CLMT in the past 5  months, it  still remains at a BARGAIN price. But it wont last forever.  Get in. Get  in now. Gains are coming our way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qphud6/5_months_ago_i_posted_about_clmt_since_then_the/

Nintendo (NTDOY) has been driven into the dirt. Its P/E is at 12.49x less than half the video game sector average P/E. 

[The Nintendo Switch is the best-selling console for the company of all time as it's about to eclipse sales of the Nintendo Wii (and likely would have without the chip shortage).](https://hexus.net/gaming/news/industry/148202-nintendo-switch-track-eclipse-wii-game-boy/)

In Nintendo's [latest quarterly earnings report](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211105e.pdf) President Furukawa calls out there will be a 20% cut in forecasted Switch hardware shipments, but software sales for next quarter are projected up 10% resulting in a net increase for a forecasted net profit of 2.9%.

Given this information, one can assume revenue from Switch software sales produces higher profits than Switch hardware sales. While the sale of a Switch console increases the total addressable market (TAM) for possible software sales, someone upgraded from say an original Switch to an OLED Switch drives very little profit for Nintendo.

We can also see that demand for Pokemon products is so high people [are getting into fights at stores over](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/target-pokemon-cards/) the products. With Pokemon Brilliant Diamond / Shining Pearl coming out next week, and Pokemon Arceus coming January 28th, 2022 demand is likely to be very strong for these titles driving lots of software sale revenue for Nintendo.

So why is the stock near its 52 week low? I understand Cathy Wood and others were disappointed Nintendo didn't announce a new system, or a ""Switch Pro"" this year, but surely a new console would be a horrible idea given the chip shortage that's expected to continue well into 2022.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qphfkt/new_pokemon_game_coming_next_week_buy_ntdoy/
1,"11/09/2021, 00:39:30",CELH put options earnings play,PennyStockWorth,"A short term, high risk but very very high reward play.

Buying puts on CELH, also know as Celsius energy drink. Personally I dont like their product but thats not why Im going to bet against them. How I came to my reason? 
See below:

So Ill start off by looking at their competitor, MNST, we all know their energy drinks Monster. Monster has a P/E ratio of 32. This means theyre not subject to crazy volatility. On the other hand, Celsius has a P/E of 783. This means people are betting lotsss that Celsius will keep growing at the crazy rates its growing. If Celsius doesnt beat their earnings forecast by lots, its simply going to fall at least 10%. (I feel) 

Monster like Celsius had a very good Q2, but Q3 they were a little below expectations. This makes me think Celsius will follow same trend as theyve been following the same trends for a long time now. 2020-2021

Challenges:
-Aluminum prices went up significantly (they use Al cans).
-The supply chain got hurt as we all know it shipping crates, trucks, etc

For this reason Im buying short term Puts on CELH. A company worth $8 Billion who brought in $130 million revenue in 2020 and $8.5mil profit in 2020.
So far in Q1-2 they brought in $115 million and $4.5 million profit. To meet the expectations of a PE ratio of 656X that analysts are expecting from them for EOY 2021, CELH must bring in $7.8 million profit in Q3 + Q4. 

So why do investors value this company so high? Because they think its going to be the next Monster or RedBull yet its growing much farther then the industry leaders. Lots of bearish investors talk about how its easy to grow when youre very small but as you get larger it gets harder and harder x Thats a very big risk with companies like this. Such a high P/E ratio makes the stock subject to very volatile reaction to something like barely missing earnings. Even if they beat earnings by say 10% itll drop 10% because 20% earnings beat is priced in. 

Some more numbers to give you an idea how much pressure the stock has:

Price/Sales industry is 2.9X
CELH is 42.9X

Price/Book industry is 6.3X
CELH is 43.1

The main reason I bet against them is because their revenue is also very small. Theyre a very healthy company in terms of good revenue growth and good profit, but its a drop in the bucket compared to their valuation. 

Some companies are worth $70B and bring in $10B a year with $100 mil profit. Thats a bad ratio but at least we know the sales are there, and when they start to focus on profit and not growth they can trim and increase their gross margin. 


But in CELHs shoes, they have a great gross margin compared to industry average. So what they need is simply very very fast growth in sales, not 5-20% a year, more like 100-300% growth for the next 2-3 years, and they cant afford to miss any Quarter estimates. In fact right now whats priced in is that they need to beat earnings by 20%.

My position is:

The reality is due to a horrendous funding decision they entered into a Death Spiral Finance arrangement resulting in the SP being decimated and left for dead. They managed to get though that and keep the cash at the cost of significant dilution whilst progressing all product pipelines and making significant progress. They are sitting on a pot of cash to keep them funded for a year, have committed to no placing in the immediate future and the future is looking really really positive. However to date the SP has hardly moved and is still &lt; 2p despite being at 14p last year, with double the shares and no progress an SP of 7p would be fair to allow for dilution. However with new candidates in the pipeline, new patents and an exciting discovery regarding Covid-19 expected to be revealed in detail soon it should be much higher.

So many reasons to invest here, First as an investment, no placing confirmed by the CEO and rock bottom prices it will go up at some point.

They are value the same as they were pre-pandemic, but have since acquired a company to go global, and revenues have grown about 100% since back then. short interest is 17%, it is low float and low volume. a turn around could blast this company to space, just like it did at the start of the pandemic, when it ran from high $70s to $196  **

Alright you nerds, let's talk about a little known company called [Bandwidth Inc.](https://www.bandwidth.com/) ($BAND), and one of the most undervalued tech plays on the market.

**Who they are and what they do :**

Bandwidth is a CPaaS company, Communications Platform as a Service. They are a B2B company that provide APIs to enterprise customers, that allow them to integrate phone calls and text messaging into software and apps. Ever call into a Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or WebEx meeting on your phone? That is Bandwidth. Ever make a call through Google Voice? That is Bandwidth. Basically any apps or software that have native calling or texting built into will use Bandwidth or a competitor like Twilio.

**Some other examples of how the products and services work:**

* Service/Call center software, would use Bandwidth APIs to built the calling into the software, or if you are texting with a support center.
* 2 factor authentication texts
* making a call from you Amazon Alexa or Google Home
* Alert texts for things like Open Table, WaitMe, or Lyft
* Advanced Emergency/911 services, that allow for more accurate location mapping when people call from big office buildings. they can see what floor and where on the floor the call is coming from.

**Let's look at some bullish shit going on with them:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's look at the huge growth over the past 3 quarters:**

&gt;**Fourth quarter total revenue of $113.0 million, up 82% year-over-year**

[**https://investors.bandwidth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bandwidth-announces-first-quarter-2021-financial-results**](https://investors.bandwidth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bandwidth-announces-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)

&gt; **First quarter total revenue of $113.5 million, up 66% year-over-year**

&gt; **Second quarter total revenue of $120.7 million, up** **57% year-over-year** 

&amp;#x200B;

Some technical info:

Band is sitting at the lower bound of a multi-year trend, after having huge growth over the past year and a half, and expanding internationally. It is sitting at a fairly oversold level on the RSI, and right at a huge column support area. It stands to reason that we will see a bounce up from here, at least to the next supply zone in the $115-120, but could trend back up as high as the upper trend line in the $160-170 area.

**Short interest is also sitting at 17%.** Not a huge amount, but with such low float and low volume, this bad boy can easily be blown sky high.

So why id BAND valued so low? My theories are that:

* They are somewhat miscategorized. The price clearly tracks with telecom infrastructure, which is somewhat justified, in that they have a nationwide network. But not justified, because they are being compared to cash dinosaurs, and not the high growth software they are providing.

https://preview.redd.it/8jii5se69ey71.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea93d51f632e48aadbcf9b416e1eedc5de165f14

* Because they are low float and low volume, when ETFs and such sell that sector, they get shoved around more that usual. 
* I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding in the market of the company, what they do, and what the potential is. I believe this incorrect categorization will change over time, and the stock is being sold at bargain barrel prices until then.

**Positions**: Currently 1150 shares. Options could be played, but the volume is low, so spreads are a bit wide. Also, it is hard to say how long a it will take for the market to realize it is missing out. Selling puts is probably free money.

1,"11/09/2021, 00:06:38",Why BioNTech (BNTX) will have blowout earnings this quarter,heart___,"Fucking value. For the 90% of you who haven't heard the term, I mean this company makes money- a lot of fucking money at ridiculous margins.

**Upcoming earnings DD- even your wife's smoothbrain boyfriend gets it**

* PFE and BNTX share covid vaccine revenues based on 50/50 gross profit.
* PFE covid vaccine revenue in Q2: $7.8B
* PFE covid vaccine revenue in Q3 (reported last week during earnings): $13B. **A 67% increase**.
* BNTX revenue in Q2: $6.4B
* BNTX revenue *analyst estimate* in Q3: $5.9B. That's right. Current average analyst estimate is **less** than last quarter. The current estimate is wayyyy low.
   * My estimate for BNTX revenue in Q3: $6.4B \* 1.67 = $10.68B, I.E. a **HUGE revenue beat**.
   * This company's historical margins are massive. I.E. a **BLOWOUT earnings beat**.
* Earnings will be released **tomorrow (Tuesday)**
* After earnings, the p/e ratio should drop from 12 to **5**. By comparison, SPX and MRNA both have a p/e ratio of \~30.

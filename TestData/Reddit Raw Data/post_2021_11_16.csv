1,"11/16/2021, 23:25:05",Why $AUR is much closer to a Gamma Squeeze than HF would like you to think,invest_opinions," 

**WHY $AUR is short squeeze candidate:**

Aurora Innovation started to trade last week after they close a business merging with RTPY SPAC. During that process, **from 100M shares, ONLY 7-8M** are available for trading right now. (The float).

**How did we come up with this number?** 

Now, from the latest prospectus, we can see that there were 903M shares to be issued. 

From that 802M were locked in for certain amounts of time (usually 3 to 6 months for PIPE investors and early investors in Aurora). 

So we have some 100M shares not locked in, some 22% are the shares issued for sponsors (the guys financing the spac) and 80M were sold. So from that 80M sold (SPAC shares) only 5M ended up to be converted in common AUR shares as 75M were redeemed. 

The sponsor agreement [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1828108/000119312521215992/d326572d8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1828108/000119312521215992/d326572d8k.htm) is imposing the sposors to forfeit their number of shares proportionally with the redeemed ones so in theory the sponsors should own now only some 1.5M shares. 

I haven't seen any filling regarding this and neither any filling regarding the actual number of shares and the float.

Market watch is showing some 640M float, a number almost identical with the outstanding number of shares - that can not be possible because the biggest number of shares (former owners of Aurora and the PIPE investors) are under lock in conditions.

I would say that, if AUR will have a day with **3-4 M shares traded**, we will def' notice if our float estimation ois correct as it **should trigger a gamma squeeze.**

**On top of that, last weeks the trade volume from Fintell shows some 0.5 - 1M short sell trades each day.**

**Short sellers got overconfident and sloppy, getting used to see every SPAC dropping under $10 after merging, and even more so the companies in AV.**

OK - but in order to see a GAMMA Short Squeeze **we need spark, right?** A reason for many people to start buying.

**WHAT will move the price and volumes higher?**

**-NVDA move in the industry**

You might have notice the spike in LAZR, INVZ, OUST and pretty much all the autonomous driving technology since $NVDA decided to develop a special platform for this industry.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2999b454-bab5-3fe6-b88a-230fa512145e/luminar-wins-nvidia-business.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2999b454-bab5-3fe6-b88a-230fa512145e/luminar-wins-nvidia-business.html)

This is huge for industry as the 700B worth Nvidia is pushing money, technology and visibility over the AV industry.

**-Infrastructure bill will bring more trucks on the roads with larger volumes and more mileage and this will focus the attention on autonomous trucks like never before.**

The infrastructure bill is pushing a lot of billions ( $110 billion to be precise) in to roads, making them better,  connecting more areas and on top of that there are other 65B for broadband network making bring high speed data closer to any area in US. 

Actually all the other billions in ports, airports etc. will mean millions of tons of materials (from cement to high tech equipment) that will need to be delivered across the country. Now, most of this shipping will be done by... yup, trucks!

But hey, there is ALREADY a shortage in work force and that is even more acute for truck drivers.

Will all this billions on the table - the shipping industry has only one way to go: **Autonomous trucks.** 

**Where $AUR is standing in this picture:**

Now here is $AUR - Aurora Innovations - a special player in the Autonomous Truck technology - where Wall Street expects to see a much faster adoption.

The reason is pretty simple - shipping as a industry is growing fast all over the world (e-commerce delivery, food, etc.), there is a shortage in qualified employees and the truck drivers, pretty much as anyone else, are asking for bigger wages.

Autonomous trucks don't need to stop to eat or go to toilet (remember that Amazon troubles with drivers peeing in bottles?), they don'tsleep, they don't have syndicates, they can't go strike and most importantly the cost of using them is set at the acquisition.

Once a competitor in shipping industry is starting to use Autonomous trucks, this will push the costs down so they can afford to push their prices lower, forcing everybody else to start using AV or close the business.

**Why $AUR has its own share of pie in all this development?** 

1. Is a serious player in a very fast, very aggressive/disruptive new industry.
2. Their leaders are recognized and followed. ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005803/en/Ahead-of-Expected-November-4-NASDAQ-Listing-Aurora-Executives-to-Address-Self-driving-Advancements](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005803/en/Ahead-of-Expected-November-4-NASDAQ-Listing-Aurora-Executives-to-Address-Self-driving-Advancements))
3. Has a very special backing: Partners: *Toyota, Uber, Volvo, and PACCAR. This companies are also investors trough PIPE in the SPAC merging that just closed last week.*
4. Just got a little over 1B in cash to boost development and commercial adoption.

SO, ready or not for the next couple of weeks $AUR will be very hot potato for short sellers and very good asset to own- in common, warrants or calls.

Now, with short squeeze in mind or not AUR is a stock to keep in mind and maybe in your portfolio but please be aware that this is not an investment advice and all that nice disclaimers that mean one thing: do your research and don't come to me if you loose money while investing.

* They accelerated their production timeline by a quarter (from Q4 to Q3 2022) while most other EV SPAC's have announced delays. The CEO also emphasized that this was conservative, meaning they could very well advance again. 
* They announced Fayettville, Arkansas (\*cough home of Walmart \*cough) as the location for their corporate headquarters, a second factory, and a R&amp;D research center.
* Announced 3 more facilities in Oklahoma in addition to their first factory including an R&amp;D, Software Development, and Customer Support/Finance centers. 
* By including Arkansas in their state partnership they are receiving an additional $100 million in incentives, making the total incentive package $400 million.
* They are targeting $100 million in vehicle orders with the states and universities where their facilities will be located.
* Selected Panasonic as their battery supplier. As you may know, Panasonic supplies batteries to Tesla. When Panasonic picks partners, they don't just pick anyone. This adds even more legitimacy to Canoo as a business. 

My question: Why is Canoo worth barely over $2 Billion? They are only a couple quarters away from production in their own factories in the US and have 2 states on their side. Yet Canoo is currently worth 1/3 of Fisker, 1/40 of Lucid, 2/5 of even Nikola..... It gets almost no coverage on CNBC when EV is being discussed even though it clearly deserves to be in the mix. 

Canoo is criminally undervalued when compared with it's competitors and the market will likely realize this very soon.

""GMG is a clean-technology focused company which aims to offer energy-saving products and solutions and energy storage products, enabled by Graphene manufactured in-house via a proprietary production process. In 2017 and 2018, GMG developed and proved its proprietary production process to produce GMG Graphene from natural gas (methane), not from mined Graphite. This process produces high quality, low input costs, scalable, tuneable and low contaminant Graphene suitable for use in clean-technology""

""In the energy storage segment GMG and the University of Queensland are working collaboratively with financial support from the Australian Government to progress research and development, and ultimately explore the commercialization of GMG graphene aluminium-ion batteries. Aluminium-ion batteries have the potential to have better energy density than lithium-ion batteries. Graphene Aluminium-ion Batteries may eliminate many disadvantages of LI Batteries, including the risk of overheating/fire and performance degradation. Management believes that successful commercialization of the Graphene Aluminium-ion Batteries would result in a superior substitute to LI Batteries in targeted applications""

Goodmorning traders, I have been waiting patiently for the higher time frames to reach levels of overbought. Well yesterday the weekly finally hit overbought. Now, this doesnt mean we will all of a sudden just drop but it does open the door to breaking out of the range. Now I am back focus on the daily chart for it to cycle. what I am looking for is like a lock cylinder, in order for the key to turn the cylinder each individual pin has to be aligned before it can turn. Same with the charts each time frame has to be aligned before the market turns. Also, we start looking at the skew index. Skew in simple terms is a measure of the difference between out of the money put and call premium. It is indicative of big money hedging or preparing for a big move. Skew gave us a heads up back June before the July sell off so it's worth watching. Not sure if skew will reach its record setting levels it reached in June but above 140 its already say watch out. 

Today'sscenarios... 

Key levels to watch regardless of day type: 467 area and 466 area 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Range day structure. We establish first range high around 467 then we find the first range low which could be 466 area but dont be surprise if we over shot down below 465 area. I think thru out the day we will push the boundaries (higher or lower) one way or another. Remember so many variations to a range day must watch indicator or internals for divergence and convergence. **35% probability** 

2) Trangeday (rounded reversal) we take off from 467 area not looking back until we get to the midday chop area of 468-469 area. After a sideways move we look for fall back towards 466. **34% probability** 

3) Trend day up. We find support before yesterdays close of 467.43. We reverse and start a trend up morning session toward 469-470. We find our midday chop along the way where we chop sideways before going into a minor pullback before resuming the major trend of the day. **31% probability**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qv8y1e/skew_youwaiting_waiting_waiting_patiently/

1,"11/16/2021, 22:06:31",$MAPS DD -- an undervalued SaaS bet on Cannabis with 100%+ upside potential,earthWindFI,"WM Technology (NASDAQ:MAPS) is an undervalued / overlooked way to play the legalization of Cannabis and the growth of independent dispensaries.

&gt; Founded in 2008, WM Technology, is a leading technology and software infrastructure provider to the cannabis industry, comprising a B2C platform, Weedmaps, and B2B software, WM Business. The cloud-based SaaS solutions from WM Business provide an end-to-end operating system for cannabis retailers. WM Business tools support compliance with the complex, disparate, and constantly evolving regulations applicable to the cannabis industry. Through its website and mobile apps, WM Technology provides consumers with the latest information about cannabis retailers, brands, and products, facilitating product discovery and driving engagement with our retail and brand customers.

/u/UCACashFlow has already posted some great DD here, which I won't repeat:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsojc7/why_i_am_long_on_maps_wm_holdings_dd/

I wanted to focus on 3 main points:

* Analysts see huge upside potential for MAPS, with the latest price targets implying +55% to +130% upside
* MAPS has strong institutional ownership, including Senvest which made $700M of profit on GME
* MAPS is significantly undervalued on a multiples basis versus its peers

MAPS is currently trading at ~$9 per share (~$1.4B market cap). The latest wall street analyst price targets are:

* Piper Sandler: $14 (+55% upside)
* Stifel: $17 (+88% upside)
* JMP: $21 (+133% upside)
* Canaccord Genuity: $21 (+133% upside)

Here's a quote from Stifel's November 14th research report:

&gt; We continue with our Buy rating, but we are lowering our target price to $17 which we derive by assigning an 11x EV/FY22E gross
profit multiple suggesting a discount to cannabis peers and premium to local &amp; online marketplaces. Our outlook suggests WM
Technology will showcase a differentiated growth profile profitably capitalizing on cannabis category growth while utilizing its significant
capital advantage to expand the platforms reach and evolve its comprehensive SaaS offering for cannabis operators. We estimate 30%
CAGR revenue growth (FY21E-FY23E) predicated on increasing penetration, growing wallet share, and participating in the growth of six key
U.S. markets we estimate will grow from $11.5 billion (TTM June 2021) to over $15 billion in 2023. Our outlook does not include a significant
contribution from the Canadian adult-use market, existing markets currently sporting limited retail density impeding outsized monetization,
or new adult use commercial systems scheduled for implementation over the next two years (New Jersey, New York, Connecticut). We
believe our outlook will prove conservative given the resources for advertising, product development, and M&amp;A. We believe the current
U.S. environment provides WM Technology the ability to enhance its platform and deepen its moat without competition from well-resourced
technology companies, thereby enhancing the ability to capitalize on our estimate for a $100 billion U.S. category.

Here's a snapshot of the largest holders of MAPS:

https://imgur.com/cAs961H

Silver Spike Capital ($91M position / 15%) is the SPAC sponsor.

Senvest Management ($54M position / 9%) is the second largest holder.

Does that name ring a bell?

That's right, Senvest is the hedge fund that famously made $700M of profit on GME:
https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687

Apes recognize apes!

Senvest has a history of making contrarian bets on overlooked companies, and MAPS is now firmly in their crosshairs.

Speaking of valuation, here's a comp table showing MAPS (top row) versus other online marketplace / eCommerce / SaaS companies.

https://imgur.com/vvE2Ss2

MAPS is trading at 5.4x 2022 revenue and ~29.9x 2022 EBITDA, a significant discount to its peers.

The options chain going from around 3$ to 7,5$ contains around 17 million shares that potentially has to be delivered if exercised or alternatively bought gradually as the price increases for those who sold call options naked (without hedging with shares)

That in itself could see the price explode a fair amount past 7,5$, but the real extra gasoline on top of the fire, inside the burning house is the short interest being around 25% of the float obtained at roughly 2-3$, will start to bleed the shorts exponentially as the cost to borrow increases (currently sitting at around 90-100%) and as the required margin continues to get raised higher and higher, more and more shorts will be forced to cover.

There's 132,7M shares outstanding of which 9,35% is held by insiders and 58,32% is held by institutions.

The float is listed as 83M shares available, but as should be apparant by looking at the information I just gave you, there can't be more than approximately 32% of shares available of the total shares outstanding, which roughly translates into an actual free float of 42M.

Consider how big a portion of this float is already owned elsewhere (including retail) a sudden potential wave of gamma squeeze buying pressure of upwards of 17M shares combined with the shorts having to cover being an additional 25% of 80M listed float, meaning 20M. Resulting in a combined buying pressure of 37M shares in a company that cannot have more than 42M shares available for trading.

Add on top of that there's literally millions of failures to deliver that applies even more buying pressure.

This is a company that is seriously undervalued with a great looking long term potential future and it has the upside potential of mega-squeezing.

I'd also like to note that the market cap is at only 390M, meaning it'll take an unusually small amount of money to really get the ball rolling. And momentum is key here, as a large portion of the call options expire this Friday.

This could fizzle out and slowly rise over the next couple of years and be a very profitable play, or it could mega squeeze well into and above the 100's.

1,"11/16/2021, 21:42:50",Does MARA have more issues?,devnah721,"Not financial advice, I'm a retard who eats crayons and enjoys the public humiliation of being epicly wrong in my financial forecasts.  Do your own due diligence.

Yesterday MARA fell some 25-28% (if you included after hours) based on the issue of convertible notes and an SEC subpoena signaling a possible investigation.

I'm not here to talk about that, there's more salt to be rubbed in these wounds.  The dip had me looking at the last earnings report.  (1) The company is being looted by astronomical compensation packages. And (2) their mining is falling way behind their stated miner count.

(1) 97 million in compensation!!!

MARA paid 97M in compensation this past quarter. Last year they paid only 4.7M for the entire year!   This comes on the heals of paying 50M two quarters ago in compensation due to old stock options.  At least that was somewhat excusable when no one thought MARA would go up so high; everyone defending MARA at the time expected it to be a one time thing.  Now what's the excuse for paying nearly twice as much, did they even bother to provide one?  The company's insiders are looting its profits faster than it can produce.  I wish the company would give some guidance as to when these epic compensation packages are going to abate...like we're rich enough, now's your turn!

(2) Mining numbers aren't matching their Miner counts.

We are more than half way through November and the entire MARA Pool has only mined 23 blocks.  Last month, MARA mined 75 blocks and even that was low for their miner count.  But now after their miners-received increased from 26,960 to 42,381 why are we falling so far short of the previous month?

Mara's miners received increased by 57% at the end of last month, but the current pace of of mining has us producing only 61% of the previous rate.  If you check a certain blockchain website as of today you can see that the current estimate of their hashrate is only 0.94 EH/S; they reported at the beginning of this month their hashrate was 2.96 EH/S...

Okay, maybe their having trouble installing miners.  Well that alone wouldn't explain why we aren't keeping pace with last month.  Maybe the installation is also interfering with their existing operations.  Or maybe the just have epicly shitty RNG...there's a luck factor involved in mining...maybe its just really really bad luck.

Yeah, all those are possibilities, some of them aren't crippling but they still suck, but there's worse possible explanations too.  Last month RIOT mined 464 coins with only 2.8 EH/s; whereas MARA reported only 417.7 with 2.96 EH/s at the end of the month.  The month before that RIOT mined 406 with 2.6 EH/s whereas MARA mined only 340.6 with 2.7 EH/S.

You see the pattern, despite having the higher EH/S its underperforming, sometimes significantly, companies with lower EH/S.  Its been doing this for months.  Is that all due to luck?  And this month is likely to create by far the biggest discrepancy.  It raises questions whether the MARA Pool they created, or their ISPs, or whatever... is able to accommodate all these new miners its purchased.

I want to be clear, I have no idea what the reason for the discrepancy is, and it could be benign, it could still be that luck factor, or something else that goes away soon...BUT its there, and its a big question mark for me...and one of the reasons I'm hesitant to get back in to this stock.

Coles notes, XTM is a challenger bank that has a Tipstoday program that allows hospitality companies to pay their employees tips/salaries daily onto a debit card without the need for cash.

Theyre already in most of the biggest restaurant names in Canada but its the US expansion thats always been the big move that will ramp up their revenue numbers well beyond what Canada ever could (understandably so).

If you want a deep dive into them, I posted on them when I first started invested in $PAID / $XTMIF and it was a beauty double for anyone that listened: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxl1dk/this\_fintech\_play\_just\_landed\_mlse\_and\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxl1dk/this_fintech_play_just_landed_mlse_and_is/)

**The Chart**

They had a really nice run up early in the year before consolidating and creating a nice support area in the $0.30-0.40 CAD range (keep in mind, this was when stocks were tanking and it held up rather well).

It's been creating a support level along the way as it keeps moving up to a higher SP range each time. These last few weeks its consolidated nicely and I think on todays news and a push into the US this could make a move to ATHs over the coming weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Having spoken with management they said their expansion into the US, and especially on the Lightspeed $LSPD platform, was put on hold until they could land a US bank to offer their services south of the border. They have numerous partnerships lined up in the US including Groot Hospitality in Miami which has a host of bars and clubs wanting to use the tipstoday program but were waiting for the services to go online.

There's also a tip pooling system that theyre creating in house that will further provide a turn key solution for companies to easily pay all of their employees wages and tips right to their card without ever needing to exchange any cash.

I think this stock has the potential of reaching new highs before year end, and with the right US exposure Id like to see $1+ in the new year as other fintech companies have seen much great evaluations off of much less IP and promise imo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qv81bw/major_catalyst_xtm_inc_xtmif_just_landed_its/

1,"11/16/2021, 21:32:27",The Case for $PSFE,ConspiracyJustin,"Paysafe, $PSFE, took a nose dive last week after missing earnings and being downgraded by most analyst. Since August, the stock had been trading between $7 and $9 with good support at $7.

Currently, the stock is trading at around $4.50. Most analyst dropped the target price to down to anywhere from $7 to $13. Most analyst have the stock as a moderate buy or strong hold.

$PSFE has 723 million shares outstanding. This puts their current market cap at around $3.5 Billion. On the low side, valuations start around $5 Billion and stretch well over $10 Billion. This means that Paysafe is EXTREMELY ripe for buyout offers. While their digital wallet is suffering (which caused the earnings miss), the rest of their business is thriving. They did 1.49B in revenue last year with gross profit over $900 million. 

The case for $PSFE, therefore, is clear cut. The 52 week low of $4.11 has been tested and offers *really* good support levels. In the short term, the price will increase by 50% - $75% which presents a great return on a short term swing trade with almost 0 downside. If the merger rumors are true, then there are several potential buyers out there who are almost assuredly eyeing a takeover at these prices. If any of those rumors materialize, then the price could easily climb 100% to 200%. 

The biggest downside to $PSFE is that this may take some time for the price to run (could be weeks or could be today). When it does, these $4.50 shares will be gone very quickly. After declining volume over the past two days, watch for volume spikes on the 4h charts (with little price increase) to signal that institutions are loading up.

1,"11/16/2021, 21:08:21",Beachbody Stock (BODY),bestclips1000,"Stock price
Beachbody stock is at all time lows of 3.20 which makes becahbodys market cap 1B. It is down 70% from its ipo.

What is beachbody stock?
Becahbody is a one stop shop for fitness. Been around for 20 years. Before the merger beachbody sold subscriptions to their fitness content, nutrition goods (shakes/snacks/meals) and apparell. After the merger with Myxfitness and Openfit they also sell workout bikes and they can be streamed from any device via the becahbody app from openfit. Adding myx and openfit introduced a lot of growth potential to Beachbody. This is what beachbody included in their investor presentation
[beachbody Projections (these could easily be bullshit but connected fitness really does a lot of potential to grow)](https://woodlandreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/913utts6qsa71-1024x455.png)

Openfit potential
Openfit is a streaming and digital company that modernized beachbodys streaming providing them with Bodi and other streaming services. The main avenue for growth here is the potential for VR streaming through the metaverse. They have said nothing about this and I am speculating, but Openfit has the capabilities to make this happen. 

Myx fitness potential
In my opinion this is where the growth really is. This bike starts at $1400 (free shipping/assembly) while the base peloton starts at $1500 (free shipping/assembly) keep in mind that as of august when myx started selling a substantial amount of bikes Peloton lowered their cost of their base bike from $1900 to $1500. Clearly they had to be more competitive with myx. Now you might be asking yourself, ok well now its only a $100 difference and its the same thing so id rather take the well known giant brand peloton. Wrong, they are different, the my fitness bike screen can turn 180 degrees and has beachbody workouts on it like weight lifting, boxing, yoga, ect while the peloton bike is just a bike and all you can do is ride the bike while someone tells you to ride the bike. I think myx will steal a lot of market share from peloton and this stock is extremely undervalued because all growth avenues are totally overlooked. 

Q3 2021 earnings
Revenue 208.1M (-17% compared to 2020) 
2 year growth in subscription = 46%
14,700 bikes sold (only 44% were delivered so only delivered count as revenue)
 Lowered guidance from yearly revenue expectations of 1.1B to now 830M for year

[Sec Q3 report](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1826889/000095017021004603/body-20210930.htm)


Very bad earnings report. Main reason for this was a decrease in nutrition subscriptions. But i still think there is a lot of growth potential here long term with connected fitness and potential metaverse applications. They dont have to meet those investor projection numbers to get back over $10 they just need to show a few good quarters that show that the conpany is growing in the connected fitness area to get it out of this 800M-1B consistant revenue range each year. If that can be done then growth will be factored into the company again because right now this is trading at about a 1 p/s ratio which means all the fears of 0 growth are priced in already. 

Competition
Beachbody is only going to become more and more of a pain the ass to Peloton as they sell more and more Myx bikes. Peloton has also had a disaster quarter and lowered guidance. Peloton has a bankruptcy risk. They are a new company and they have a lot of debt. They have 1.6B in debt and 900M cash&amp;cash equiv. Beachbody on other hand has 0 debt and 200M of cash on hand. Beachbody has been around for 20 years and they are resilient like cockroaches but only now do they finally want to grow and modernize which is exactly what i think openfit/myx will help them do. Peloton p/s ratio is 7:1 while bodys is 1:1. 

Should you buy beachbody?
Obviously im not a financial advisor and this is a very risky company and youre listening to a degenerate finance student on reddit. But I think if you see any growth potential in this company, youre getting a good deal. 

My position
2,800 shares at 8.30

From the recent SEC filings I updated the 2012 Award package exercise progress ^((1) (2)).

Total sell-off progress towards Twitter goal: 33.16%.

Interesting tidbit: Elon sold the exact same number of shares yesterday as a week ago. Maybe today will be another Power Bottom Tuesday?

It seems that the trade plan from Sep 14, 2021 ^((3)) calls for \~10% of the 2012 options exercised every week, which projects an exercise progress of 80% by the end of the year. However, Elon seems to be well ahead of the exercise progress with the share sell-off. By this rate, he will reach his Twitter sell-off goal by Dec 4. By then, I expect TSLA to have lost 30% of its market cap from the last closing price before Elon's tweet: $1222.09-30%=$855.

Holdings: Short 2 TSLA, long 1 TSLA Feb18'22 1020P.

1,"11/16/2021, 18:24:01","$POWW - Ammo Inc - Earnings Beat, Revenue Guidance Increase, Next Multi Bagger",lFUCK1," **About:**

Ammo, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells ammunition and ammunition component products for use in handguns and long guns in the United States and internationally. Poww was founded in 1990 and is based in Scottsdale Arizona. Poww reported its second quarter earnings last night and crushed estimates.

**Earnings Highlights:**

Poww released its earnings last night and beat on both revenue and EPS

Revenues of 61.8m exceeding the 55m estimate

Net income of 14.1m vs 9.1m estimate

Earnings per share of 0.17 vs .11 estimate

Increased revenue guidance 19% for the next 2 quarters from 210m to 250m

Recorded a backlog of orders of 185million

**Revenue Growth:**

Poww has been growing at an exponential rate. seeing growth rates of around 50% per quarter and increasing margins.

**12/31/2020:**

Revenues - 15.4m

Net income -  -1.9m loss

**03/31/2021:**

Revenues -26.9m

Net income - -460k loss

**06/31/2021:**

Revenues - 42m

Net income - 9.5m

**09/30/2021 :**

Revenues - 61.8m

Net income- 14.1M

**12/31/2021 - Guidance puts the next 2 quarters at atleast 73.5m to reach 250m guidance** 

**03/31/2021 - Guidance puts the next 2 quarters at atleast 73.5m to reach 250m guidance** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Future Outlook**

Poww is primed to be a long term hold and multi bagger because of the following:

**1. Ammunition Shortage** \- Ammo shortage across the us yet production is at all time highs. More and more americans are buying and stock piling ammo due to civil unrest.

**2. Hunting Season** \- starts in quarter 3, this is when peak sales will occur as it runs from late September to November.

**3. 2x DoD Contracts -** awarded 2 government contracts in the past 6 months. 

On September 23 awarded defense contract for signature on target rounds

On June 23 awarded defense contract for ballistic ally matched multi purpose rounds

I am expecting this trend to continue with the ammo short in place.

**4. New Facility (3x Output in 2022)** \- is building a 160,000 square foot facility which will be done in the summer of 2022. This facility is 2-3 times larger then their current facility and will be state of the art. On the call last night the Ceo stated this facility will be mainly automated and be one of the most modern facilities in the U.S. Which just further increases the output + margins.

**5. $185,000,000 backlog** \- this backlog will continue to grow as the ammo shortage continues to burden the U.S

**6. Going to allow payment of cryptocurency soon**

**7. Acquired Gun broker for 240m in the summer of 2021 -** Gunbroker is one of the larger retail sellers of all gun, and gun related items. This acquisition has bolstered sales and created horizontal mergers. Allowing their ammo to be sold on the website and getting more global reach.

**8. Record Year for Gun Sales -** U.S. gun sales in January surged 60% to 4,137,480. This makes it the largest single month since figures started to be recorded in 1998. Gun sales and ammo sales will continue to grow as more and more civilians are uneasy from social unrest.

 **9. Bidens Russian Ammo Ban -** Biden announced that in August 2021 the U.S would be banning the importation of Russian Ammunition. This just created a further shortage in the ammo chain and is allowing U.S producers to increase prices and margins.

**10. Social Unrest Increasing Crime -** 2021 has had the highest crime rates on record as a result of defunding the police. More and more civilians are bearing their right to arms to counter this.

**11. Supreme Court Case &amp; Guns** in the news might as well be free advertising at this point.

**Price History**

The stock is trading 30% below its all time highs this year of 10.37. This earning announcement and increased guidance should cause the stock to climb back to its all time highs. There should be some new analyst coverage in the next day or so. Currently there are 2 price targets of 11 and 12, I expect these to be increased and new coverage/price targets to come out.

**Short Interest**

The stock currently has 17.1% of its float sold short. This isn't enough for a squeeze but after these earnings reports we may see some shorts start to cover their positions gradually which will help the stock climb back to it's all time highs.

**Price Target:**

I am expecting Poww to run to the 15-20$ range by end of 2022. Once the factory has been completed in Q1 2023 (summer 2022) their revenue run rate will be exceeding 500m a year, with a net profit margin of 25% (23% currently) puts this stock at 125m net income per year which will put the stock at a Price to Earnings ratio of 12.

**Disclosure:** I am long on the stock",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qv4tq7/poww_ammo_inc_earnings_beat_revenue_guidance/

5,"11/16/2021, 17:14:21",Rivian Is The Modern Day Pets.con,OtherwiseSail3,"Rvian has obtained legendary status among the Pets.com of the world with its ability to command a market cap of 130B+ on virtually 0 sales. Even banking Rivian will be able to deliver on all of its pre-orders (which are never guaranteed) there are so many obstacles and risks to their success; they should not command a massive multiple. Currently their biggest competitor Tesla is trading at 25x revenue and has traded from 15-30x revenue over the last 1-2 years. Today Rivian is trading at 150200even 250x Price to Revenue. While comparing Tesla ( a well known, huge company with multiple production plants, battery tech, great engineers, market dominance,  Elon, a huge following, massive assets, full AI self driving and a proven production / delivery method) is like comparing apples to apes, let do it. Lets use Price to Revenue as the model and compare Rivian revenue to Tesla revenue. To be fair we should take the anticipated cars being made this year (Rivian says they hope 1k)* average cost of each car (67.5k base + extras = ~75k lets say) = 75mm in sales. To make it a better comparison lets make this a yearly number. Also lets make a great case for Rivian with great production efficiently, no problems, continued refinement, and growth from current cars per day(CPD) (current pace is ~3per day or ~320 by EOY but they hope to deliver 1k cars by EOY 2021 which is goal of 1k/108 days since 9/14/21 production start = CPD of 9.25) and lets double it next year. That would give us 9.25 x 2 x 365 x 75k = 506mm per year in revenue and make todays valuation (at 131B) 258x FY 2022 revenue only after assuming a myriad of extremely positive assumptions. For fun lets triple 9.25 and even then at 760mm in revenue that is 172x FY2022 revenue. Said another way, in order for Rivian to have the same Price/Revenue as Teslas average of 22 they would have to produce 5.95Billion in revenue or 79.4k cars per year or ~218 CPD aka 72x their current CPD rate or 23.5x their 2021 target CPD rate. So lets reverse engineer that to find a reasonable stock price  FY2022 best case sales 760m*30 (highest Tesla P/R)=22.8B or ~21$ per share which is still ~8x what Amazon paid about a year ago.

A. After the stock price passes the strike price 
B. After it passed the break even price
or 
C. As soon as the stock goes up 1 cent from the moment I bought the call.
I saw a post earlier where some Chad sold his TSLA calls at about 70% profit within 3 hours before even reaching his breakeven point. I was under the assumption you had to first pass the breakeven point to make profit.

Pretty sure you guys have heard of SHIB which has been so overused these days especially since Elon Musk plays around too much with his tweets pumping these coins. FLOKI has caught the hype of the normal people and so did CATGIRL. Why did it catch the hype? Elon tweeted words that has something to do with these.

The market caps of these coins are as follows:

SHIB: $28 Billion

FLOKI: $2.5 Billion

CATGIRL: $450 Million

Keep in mind, these coins have gone higher in the past and will surely go past it as this bullrun isn't over yet. However, the probability of you getting 10x or more on these coins is less as the market cap is huge already. You might still have chance with FLOKI and CATGIRL, but again, chances are small.

The good news is there is one more coin that hasn't caught the eye of the public yet. Introducing Optimus Cat (OPCAT). This is the only other coin that Elon tweeted about that the public is still sleeping on. The developer so far has been delivering more than talking. It is available on PancakeSwap and will be available in Uniswap soon. The best news is, it is still $4.5 Million market cap. What this means is the probability of 100x is highest amongst the other coins I mentioned. CATGIRL once reached $850 Million market cap. Even if the heights that OPCAT can achieve is half of it, it is a 100x.

Like I've said DYOR and this is not financial advice.

I've been in the telegram group and talked to the devs myself and so far they have delivered more than planned. I believe this is a sleeping giant. Look into it.

Data is from Yahoo Finance GME historical prices.

'You are here' is Nov 15, 2021.

The  failure to roll produces FTDs C+35 days later from the futures roll and expiration.  Share offerings and sale by Blackrock in the last quarter reduced need to roll in September.  Shorts did not roll futures in December 2020 and that led to the  January Sneeze which was added to by FOMO and options play galore.

First some basic numbers on the company:

$270M current market cap @ $6.89/share

$215M cash on hand

$1M debt

$100M projected 2021 earnings which is 45% YoY growth

Fair market value based on DCF analysis: 

$45-65, depending on assumptions

The upper end of this range is still below the ATH of $77 back in Feb 2021.

Why is the stock so undervalued? There is an active DOJ investigation into insurance fraud.

Seeking alpha summarizes the potential impact of a positive or negative outcome to the investigation quite nicely.

Basically, a positive outcome likely means a rapid move to $47, or +682% from the current share price of $6.89.
A negative outcome would be a $100M fine, loss of 55% of revenue, and a move to $8.80. Which would still be +27% from the current price.

While we were working toward the completion of our business combination, we acted decisively to advance our plans for our global affiliate program and monetize one of our assets by leveraging a B2B partner relationship. The start of this program provided increased revenue in the third quarter and is an essential building block of our B2B2C strategy, which we expect will lead to an increased user base and additional revenue from those end users going forward. Additionally, the implementation of a dynamic pricing model and improvements to our app, such as push notifications, contributed to strong growth in gross profit per transaction compared to the prior year period.

Mr. DiMatteo continued, Now that we have successfully completed our business combination, we are focused on utilizing the proceeds we realized from the transaction, along with our third quarter profits, to accelerate our targeted user marketing campaigns, enter new markets, expand our product offerings, and execute strategic and synergistic acquisitions. With our low customer acquisition costs, large addressable markets and leading brands, we look forward to realizing the profitable growth opportunities before us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/quz5fx/ltry_earnings_low_float_highly_shorted/

1,"11/16/2021, 12:02:17",Want to profit off SPACE X? HERES HOW! DD on SPACEX payment partner $FOUR (Shift4 payments),Esports_Psycho,"$FOUR is a payment processing company that recently made a 5 YEAR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH SPACE X. 

Recently SPACE X made a deal with Shift4 payments(Ticker $Four) to handle all payments for Space X. Not only will they be the payment processor for all Space X Satellite customers they will also serve SpaceX restaurants and other hospitality venues in Starbase and they will only keep expanding by offering other payment services to nearly all Space X employees and customers. THIS IS HUGE FOR THE FUTURE OF A COMPANY LIKE SHIFT4(Ticker $FOUR). 

[5-year global Space X  partnership](https://preview.redd.it/9hycywdfqvz71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b4ec4152ef36ac9c899fcb80b39819f596ba4d2)

This company will reap massive gains from all the revenue they generate as a result of this partnership. Space X is already valued at 100 BILLION DOLLARS. With the total volume of payments, they make its not priced into the stock how much they will make in the future off this partnership. 

I expect once more people look into this they will realize the potential and the stock will keep rocketing. The stock just started trending upward already and I'm expecting more and more analysts are starting to realize this opportunity, therefore, driving up the price. $Four already hit $104.11 this year and I expect it to blow past it due to the newly announced partnership. I would say now is the perfect time to get in before more and more people realize how strongly this company will be affected due to SPACE X. My PT FOR $FOUR IS $150 by the end of the year.

Stop using it to confirm your bias.,kokanuttt,"As the quarterly Institutional Reporting season comes to end, you have likely seen an abundance of posts and comments that are formatted like this: **""{Insert major institutional investor here} bought shares of {ticker} so it MUST be good!!!""**

Vanguard and Blackrock have 8 and 9 Trillion dollars in AUM respectively, them being invested in your company with 2\*10-4% of their assets doesn't really mean much. They also have 13,756 and 14,996 reportable holdings respectively, your one stock really isn't that special when it comes to these two (and other massive institutions). Frankly, Vanguard and Blackrock NOT being invested in your stock should be a massive sign of concern.

In most cases most of the stocks held by Vanguard and Blackrock are just wrapped up into a nice mutual fund or ETF and given out to investors. The vast majority of the time you see vanguard or Blackrock buying or selling stock is due to them rebalancing their funds with set preset parameters. For example, here is how vanguard decides which stocks to buy for its largest ETF:

&gt;""The Total Stock Market Index Fund and Extended Market Index Fund use a sampling method of indexing, meaning that the Funds advisor, using computer programs, generally selects from the target index a representative sample of securities that will resemble the target index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics."" - [link](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/faces/JSP/Funds/ProspRep/FundProspectusReportsWinJSP.jsp?fundId=0970&amp;isReqFromProducts=true)

Subscribers here by thousands float,

And jostle one another down,

Each paddling in his leaky boat,

And here they fish for gold and drown.

&amp;#x200B;

Now buried in the depths below,

Now mounted up to heaven again,

They reel and stagger to and fro,

At their wits end, like drunken men.

&amp;#x200B;

Meantime, secure on Garraway cliffs,

A savage race, by shipwrecks fed,

Lie waiting for the foundered skiffs,

And strip the bodies of the dead.

 ***Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds*** is an early study of [crowd psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology) by Scottish journalist [Charles Mackay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mackay_(author)), first published in 1841 under the title *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions*.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds#cite_note-1) The book was published in three volumes: ""National Delusions"", ""Peculiar Follies"", and ""Philosophical Delusions"".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds#cite_note-2) Mackay was an accomplished teller of stories, though he wrote in a journalistic and somewhat sensational style.

Vroom fell off a cliff on August 10th, when the CEO shared his view that used car prices had crested. It also took a hit when the Wall Street Journal published a story on shitty customer service at Carvana and Vroom.

On the bright side, Vroom beat expectations for Q3 and made up ground on Carvana, which is currently valued 20x higher ($52B vs. $2.5B) despite reporting only 3.8x more in quarterly revenue ($3.48B vs. $897M), a drop from 4.4x in Q2.

But again the bizarre thing is that institutions report owning 121% of outstanding shares. Insiders own another 5M shares, for a total of 125%. I dont see how this is possible.

Meanwhile, the short interest on Vroom is 15%, or 18M shareseven though nearly the entire float is held by institutions or insiders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/quwrpm/wtf_121_institutional_ownership_at_vrm/

I have a question: Let's say I have a few $K to play with.  With the idea of course of making as much $$$ as I can, as quickly as I reasonably can (like everyone else), how should I invest (read below first, please)?

I'm getting a very late start in life on this.  I grew up extremely poor, no dad and so I never had anyone even mention thinking about my golden years, let alone how to invest and always thought stocks were for rich people who had advisors and you lose all your money otherwise.

But now I know better and I've been able to grow $500 into $10,000 by buying low priced and even penny stocks (carefully on those, thanks to warnings in subs like this one), over a period of about 15 months, by spreading it over 3 or 4 stocks and as it grew, across 10 to 20 stocks, all held short term (you only make money when you sell, right).

But over the last 4 or 5 months, it seems like I've plateaued and I'm just bouncing back and forth between $9,500 and $10,500 and I'm wondering if I need to change my strategy and how?  I figured maybe it's a stage lots of you went through and know how to proceed from here to break this cycle!

I've been shying away from higher (for me) priced stocks ($50+), because even if it goes up 20%, you have to have a lot of shares to make any real money and unless you risk dumping all of your money into that one stock, you're not going to make much and it could go the other way and really hurt you and I don't have the time or funds to keep restarting.  This is pretty much do or die for me.

So what strategy would you guys recommend?  Should I start looking at higher priced stocks?  Or maybe cap at $35 per share, but buy less stocks (symbols) and put more money into each one (symbol)?  Or even pick some really cheap stocks too?

Or is there something that I'm just altogether missing here???

I do read this sub and others, but it seems like every time I see a thread (?) about a stock that was a winner, it's right after it spiked. &lt;lol&gt;

I appreciate very much any advice anyone can give me!  I really wants to raise up off this plateau and turn my pocket change into a vault full of money.

**As an old engineer, I  have a tendency to look at moderate worse case scenarios. And while this  is not the Worse case by any means... I thought it would be an  instructive exercise to look at what happens with GOGL  Golden Ocean's business if Rates stay right about here for a while (I  think we are at the bottom of the current drop, but who can say for  sure).**   
 

**There is no question Q3 report will be Blow-Out (expected earnings Q3= 0.63... I think they will beat that handily)**   
**So this is about going forward... ie forward guidance.**   
 

**Some things to keep in mind in this exercise, GOGL has:**   
**Shares outstanding 200M, GOGL current stock price $9/share. Current dividend 50c/qtr. Mrket Cap $1.8 Billion**   
**All in Cost or BE operating cost Capesize 12.8K/day, Panamax 8.4K/day , or a blended BEC of about 11K/day/vessel.**   
**94 vessels mostly Capesize (50%) and Panamax size (40%)**   
[**CEO**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=CEO) **reported that GOGL has 25% of its fleet out on 6 month or longer charter at 35K/day.**   
**The rest is subject to spot rates.**   
 

**For this exercise I am going to use 28K/day for Capesize pretty much the bottom of the recent plunge from 80K/day.**   
**And surprisingly about the same for Panamax... this is just the way rates move around, its all about short term demand.**   
 

**This also makes the rest of this estimated exercise simpler, since its a educated guess in any case.**   
 

**FCF calculation:**   
**OK, blended AlL in OR BEC (break even cost) for entire fleet is about 11K/day. This is likely conservative, because GOGL is paying down debt etc.**   
**So 94 vessels X 75% of fleet on spot rates (25% are already on  charter at 35K/day) = 70 vessels with BEC at 11, earning 28K/day... so  net gain of $17K/day/vessel. 70 X 17k/day X 80 days = $95 Million FCF  for the 70 ships in a quarter.**   
 

**PLUS the other 25% on charter at $35k/day = 24 vessels X 24k/day(35k/day-11k/dayBEC) X 80 days = $46 Million/quarter.**    
**So Total FCF for the fleet per quarter if rates stay at this current charter spot rates is 141Million/qtr.**    
**There for TOTAL = 0.70/share/qtr FCF.**    
 

**Now keep in mind over the last month Capesize rates have fallen dramatically, so chances are there were charter fixtures for GOGL's  Capes in the last month that were significantly higher than 28K/day.  Probably more of an average of $35-40K/day. Q3 FCF will definitely be  much higher, and Q4 on average will likely be above this 70c/share FCF  as well. But I am going for a quasi-worst case scenario, that assumes  rates stay right here at the bottom of this current plunge.**   
 

**Using these lower rates, GOGL will  ""only"" be making $0.70/qtr FCF or $2.80 FCF on a $9 stock per year...  hmmm More than 30% FCF over the next 4 quarters in this scenario.**    
**They will pay out at least 50c/qter in dividends as well... for a 22% yld.**   
 

**Well, that is my conservative estimate. If it turns out that we have  seen the bottom of dry bulk rates and they begin to trend upward.. well  it only gets better. Obviously if rate continue to trend down, the FCF  will drop.**   
 

**Most recent analyst puts GOGL NAV at $12/share and a price target of 19/share.. We will see.**   
 

**However, BOATS are very volatile and we have seen extreme volatility in dry bulk Capesize rates recently.**   
**The container ships are doing much better and only over the last few days have seen a drop in prices from very high rates...** [**ZIM**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=ZIM) **being my main play here.** [**LNG**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=LNG) **rates and also energy product rates are still quite high as well.**   
 

**Stocks I own: GOGL,** [**SBLK**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=SBLK)**,** [**EGLE**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=EGLE)**,** [**SB**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=SB)**,** [**ZIM**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=ZIM)**, DAC, FLNG,** [**SFL**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=SFL)**, and of course specialty shipper** [**KNOP**](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=KNOP)**.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* On Monday, stocks struggled to find direction amid extreme volatility in Tesla Inc. and a jump in bond yields.
* Major equity indexes recovered from session lows as Tesla reduced losses after entering a bear market with a nearly 20% drop from a record. Earlier in the day, the company plummeted when CEO Elon Musk suggested selling more of his shares. 
* Treasuries fell on concern that the Federal Reserve may have to reduce asset purchases more quickly following the fastest inflation in three decades.
* Following a year marked by unrelenting stock gains and a bond selloff, analysts have begun pitching their calls for 2022, with the spectre of inflation looming big in investors' minds. 
* Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson anticipates the S&amp;P 500 to fall to 4,400 in the next 12 months, a 6% decrease from Friday. While profits are expected to expand further, he warns that a slowing economy and the withdrawal of Fed assistance would likely put pressure on valuations.
* It's the third week of the month when most equity options expire, and the event has regularly jolted equities this year. **While history is not always a reliable indication, the S&amp;P 500 has reported a 1% increase  in either direction  in six of the last eight expiration weeks, according to data provided by a major news wire.**
* According to Janus Henderson investors, worldwide dividends just had their best-ever third quarter, putting them on track to surpass their pre-pandemic peak by the end of 2021. The money manager boosted its projection for total payouts to $1.46 trillion this year, citing stronger balance sheets and optimism about the future, indicating a speedier comeback to an all-time high than projected in its previous report.
* This week's attention will be on consumer strength, with retail sales expected to accelerate on Tuesday and industry titans such as Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. reporting quarterly results. Strong merchandise expenditure should continue to put a strain on global supply systems, which are already struggling to keep up.
* Even if hopes for a breakthrough on big issues are low, Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will have much to talk about during their first virtual summit, including sanctions to Taiwan. According to a Biden administration official, the virtual summit, which begins at 7:45 p.m. on Monday night in Washington, will span many hours, including translation for both leaders in their third conversation this year.

Currently there is a shortage of workers and companies are having difficulty filling positions and as we move forward this is set to get worse before it gets better. 

Fords advantage comes from the fact that they stopped producing sedans, and the trained knowledgeable workers working on those lines were moved to more profitable new product lines like the Mustang MachE, F150Lightning, Bronco, Maverick ect ect.

12% month to month unit sales increase in October was supported by this advantage, but more importantly Ford will be able to scale up faster then its competitors because of the availability of Ford trained workers local to their factories..

Analysis &amp; Conclusion: 
Ford grew sales at 26% in September and 12.1 % in October. With a projected 8% growth rate month to month for 10 months Ford will have tripled sales and revenue by August 2022 from August 2021. If this were to take place Ford stock would be worth well over $100.00 a share IMO. Keep in mind the 26% growth in September and the 12.1 % in October is constrained by supply shortages. I used a conservative 8% projection to account for future potential supply constraints so I believe numbers are in the ballpark.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qus8qp/ev_play_bullish_as_f_ford_iil_fords_significant/

To make the post a bit longer here some barrons coverage:

&amp;#x200B;

Stock in Rivian Automotive isn't braking for anything right now.

Shares were up again Monday after an epic first week, making the electric truck start-up now the world's third most valuable auto maker.

Rivian (ticker: RIVN) stock tacked on another 13% to last week's roughly 67%. The company kicked off trading Tuesday at $78 a share, and the stock closed Friday at almost $130. Monday's price was hovering around $145.

The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both flat.

Monday's gain amounts to almost $15 billion in market value based on a fully diluted share count -- more than the market capitalizations of other aspiring electric vehicle producers Nikola (NKLA), Fisker (FSR), Lordstown Motor (RIDE), and Workhorse (WHKS), combined.

Rivian has, very roughly, 890 million common shares outstanding, assuming underwriters exercised their typical option to buy a few more shares after the initial public offering to satisfy strong investor demand. But the basic figure excludes roughly 67 million management stock options with a strike price of less than $12 a share; another roughly 35 million shares that were granted as restricted stock units; and another 20 million shares associated with outstanding warrants and other items.

On a fully diluted basis, the stock count is roughly 1 billion shares, making the fully diluted market cap about $145 billion. Only Tesla (TSLA), valued at more than $1 trillion, and Toyota Motor (TM), with a $300 billion market cap, are more valuable. Volkswagen (VOW3. Germany) comes in fourth with a market cap of about $139 billion. General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) are worth about $170 billion, combined.

All the cash that Rivian has on hand could be factored into its valuation. Comparing corporate enterprise values -- and not market capitalizations -- sometimes helpful. Enterprise value is, essentially, stock market value and debt, net of cash on the balance sheet.

The auto industry, however, tends to be a special case. Most auto makers have large automotive finance units -- like like banks with a lot of debt. But the finance units have a lot of assets, too, that need to be accounted for, such as the vehicles financed.

Ford is a good example. It has a market capitalization of about $80 billion and total debt of about $146 billion. But that debt, for the most part, is part of Ford Motor Credit -- and Ford Motor Credit has almost $130 billion in cash as well as loans outstanding to customers. Including those assets and adjusting for debt and cash held at Ford's automotive operations, Ford's enterprise value is a little lower the market cap.

In the end, it's easier to compare automotive market capitalizations.

No matter what numbers are used, the Rivian rally is amazing. Where it goes is anyone's guess. There are no Wall Street estimates to guide investors yet.

Sales in 2023 might approach $10 billion based on the company's production plans, which would put the stock at about 15 times sales. Tesla trades for roughly 11 times estimated 2023 sales.

Rivian, of course, is smaller and will be growing faster that Tesla in 2023, but that is one data point investors can use to help value the truck maker before analysts begin writing research reports.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qur32n/rivn_short_144_avg/

They reported earnings for Quarter 3 on November 9th, 2021. Revenue was reported to be $392 million, which is up 35.5% from the same quarter last year, beating expectations by $5.54 million. Furthemore, in Q3 they added 34 new customers and closed 54 deals worth at least $1 million, 33 of which were at least $5 million, and 18 of which were worth at least $10 Million. For Q4, Palantir is expecting $418 Million in revenue, consensus is $401.87 Million. The CEO of PLTR, Alex Karp, said that they expect revenue to grow at a rate of 30% or more for 2021 - 2025. Now lets discuss their valuation...

1. Since Palantir had a larger number of customers and government deals in Q3, they reported stronger revenue growth, However, growth did lag in comparison to other competitors who are in the same space such as Datadog and Snowflake. 
2. Palantir demonstrated the highest value for EBITDA margins compared to other companies in the space. Adjusted free cash flow for quarter 3 was $119 Million, which was a $172 million improvement year-over-year, representing a margin of about 30%. 
3. Despite the fact that this company looks like its trading at a cheap price compared to its peers, it is trading at 17 to 20x revenue multiples which means that if they happen to have a bad quarter, the stock can drop hard. However, keep in mind that they do seem to be executing pretty well since theyve been growing the amount of deals theyve been making with organizations and firms, Have strong revenue growth, and also have good EBITDA margins. 

All of this being said, Palantir may be a buy only if you believe in the company long-term. In order for Palantir to succeed, they will need to grow their commercial product offering, since they already have a good presence on the government side. Things do seem to be going well on that end though because the commercial side growth has been going up as of recently. In my opinion, this company is still trading at too high of a price, your money would be better off invested in a different tech company.

1,"11/16/2021, 04:46:12",Puts: Musk has a tax incentive to down ramp,BossDoesntKnow,"So tax is payable by reference to market value at exercise date. The ""cheapest"" way to lower that tax bill is to tank the price prior to exercising. 

So, to simplify the math: let's go a 50% tax rate and compare 1 call option, zero exercise. Two scenarios 1. set market at 100 and 2. Set market at 1000 

In the first instance, elon has a 50% x 100 x $100 = 5k tax bill. To pay, he sells 50 shares.

In the 2nd 50% x 100 x $1000 = 50k tax bill. Again 50 shares sold to satisfy. No difference 

BUT

Let's say elon sells shares first. His first tranche of sales, let's say 5, sell for $1000. His second tranche, sell at $100 for another 5 shares. Now he has 5.5k cash. The share price however is now 100. So he exercises his options. His tax bill on the options: $5k. Guess what - he has the cash already and it only cost him 10 shares.

In short, if the endgame is maximise shares in tesla, the best approach is to sell first exercise later",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qupzc8/puts_musk_has_a_tax_incentive_to_down_ramp/

1,"11/16/2021, 04:13:59",GPRE DD - High short interest and obscene margins unforeseen by analyst community. Parabolic?,platinumsombro,"Green Plains is one of the largest ethanol producers in the US producing almost a billion gallons per year with ethanol production revenue accounting for almost 75% of their total revenue. For those unaware, ethanol is a corn based alcohol that is primarily blended at a 10% ratio into gasoline and is found in almost every blend per federal mandate.

They just got wrecked by Q3 earnings vs Analyst expectations. Due to the corn inverse in July and August, the entire industry had been paying between 100-150c above the Chicago corn price in basis throughout most of Q3 (equates to -.55c of ethanol margin contribution on the high end using 2.9 gallons per bushel of corn) that the analyst community did not seem to realize. Spot margins mostly ended up being negative on a $/gal basis for July and August once you include corn price, so you get ugly as sin earnings report and the stock has corrected 15%.

Now consensus analysts expect $.25c EPS for Q4 (roughly 15 mil earnings) With that said, GPRE per their 10Q is looking to produce roughly 240 MMGal in Q4 and October spot margins were about $.70/gal and halfway through Nov weve averaged $1.30 of board crush margin. I easily think we could average over $1 for the entire quarter and with 240 mil gallons would give us well over $250 mil EBITDA (it does depend on how much margin theyve hedged though) given corn is mostly at a discount to the CBOT corn price across the country. 

Ethanol Chicago Platts Argo Swap is the primary trading instrument for ethanol and is a full-month average financially settled swap if youre interested in checking it out. The commodity is going parabolic currently while corn stays flatish.

Combine that with an 18% short interest on a low volume stock that equates to ~10 days to cover on the short interest (surprisingly close to Avis and GameStop in terms of days to cover), my gut feeling is that they show a $2 to $5ish EPS (depends on non-spot margin parts of the business and hedging) vs current consensus analyst expectations of $.25 which could start making the stock parabolic after Q4 earnings as bears get routed, similar to Avis.

Position: long 3/17/22 $60 calls vs $39.50 underlying. Will post screenshot in comments.

Has gone parabolic in the past, as recent as July from $12-70. Setup is similar now with open interest and volume at the outer most call strikes for this week ($115). 

My play: long shares and short covered calls (boomer play, yay). My degen play: call debit spread, long 20, short 40 strike plus long 115 strike as additional cost (positive for gamma vs MM). Ratio of call debit spread to straight long 115 is 1:2.

 As you probably know IONQ is recent deSPAC and first publicly-traded pure-quantum company. The company is proud to be the leader in quantum computing (QC) market. The company is backed by Amazon, Samsung, Kia, Hyuandai, Bosch, Lockheed Martin, HP, Bill Gates' BEV, Michael Dell and others. The biggest shareholder here is Alphabet (Google) with &gt;10% stake. Currently products of IONQ have highest quantum volume of all QCs (65K x more than products of competitors) and they are already available for public on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure. The business models is QCaas (quantum computers as a service). And QCaas market is estimtaed to be worth $26B by 2030, while the enterprise value of IONQ is only ca. $1.6B. 

https://thequantumdaily.com/2021/08/19/quantum-computing-as-a-service-market-sizing-how-we-did-it/ 

Many think that quantum computer are millions years away, but ""they are just here, just now"". IONQ in their investor presentation says that inflection point will be as soon as in 2023, while ""broad quantum advantage"" will appear in 2025. And there are many breakthrouugh, disruptive and world-changing applications of that technology, like better optimization, faster new drug discovery (in 2028), better materials for EVs and others, like preventing next pandemic.

And now one of the most exciting (based on what's most trending now) application is QC krypto mining This article shows that this is VIABLE, using so called Grover's algorithms. 

And now: if - hypothetically - IONQ's work on that and find an effective sollution from QC krypto mining and further patents it technology, it could potentially grab most of krypto mining market, which has potential of $100B+ given the current price of Bictoin and the fact that ca. 2M of Bictoin remains not mined. This opportunity looks very promising, given that the company estimates to have $523M of revenue in 2026 and $271M EBIDTA in that year. And here it might potentially boost it revenue to multiple dozen billion dollar.

So why not use this, if IONO is the leader of QC market, with so strong advantage over its rivals? The confidence is so strong, that the CEO dedared in some of recent interviews that he's not worried about competitors as for now. 

Unfortunately, Peter Chapman, CEO of IONQ, rejected that he's working on that potential application. He said ""We have not started doing any kind of real work on how to mine Bictoin with a quantum computer. We run jobs for thousands of customers. So maybe there's somebody out there working on that, but it's not something we're working on"". 

Source: 
https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-273799/ 

And I think this is not the right thing, that they are not working on it, beacuse they are leaders and ifthey don't do it, someone else WILL much likely do it. And personally I think that this would be unfair, if a breakthrough technology company earned only small portion of money from QCaas and the real money (big money) are earned by third parties. 

And now imagine that potential extra cash from Bictoin mining. Not only may it boost stock price, but could also help the company to fund further active growth and development to strengthen its leadership and supremacy over rivals. 

Thus, I suggest that we all- minority shareholders and members of that community/board - regardless of differences between us - SHOULD write emails to the company (info@ionq.com) to convince or at least encourage them to work on potential application of their QC technology and using Grover's algorithms - KRYPTO MINING. 

And if we - minority shareholders, members of that conmmunity - UNITE and try to encourage IONQ to work on it, they SHOULD consider it., because the voice of minority investors who invested and trusted them should be considered.

Furthermore, personally I think that engagaement of IONQ in such an additional project which is associated with core activity, has almost only advantages, I actually don't see any disadvantages of it at all. First, the company, given its current cash position, strong backings and some prestige as of being a public company has all the resources to engage in such project. Second, the positive outcome from such project could be EXTREMELY beneficial to all stakeholders, the company would have extra cash for growth, shareholders would profit and that would also come with social benefit. 

Why the last? Because of ""clean krypto mining"" idea, which is really relevant here. If those Grover's algorithms enable faster krypto mining, it will mean that the same output require MUCH lower input (energy consumed). Thus, krypto mining - which will be continued regardless of circumstances- by applying QC technology will leave CONSIDERABLY LOWER carbon print. 

I invite you all for real, essential discussion about that and to contacting the company with your suggestions about that. Please comment here about your thoughts, suggestions, findings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/quozvg/ionq_and_krypto_mining/

MULN is working on a few things that I believe will significantly increase the value of the company.

1) They are unveiling their first US-manufactured vehicle at the Los Angeles Auto Show in 2 days. They have a countdown to the international world debut on their website:

2) Their debut vehicle is an Electric SUV crossover. They also have a couple of cargo van models in the pipeline. As we've seen with Rivian, the demand for electric SUV is palpable, and a strong debut will shine a light on what MULN can deliver.

3) They have bought up factory space in Mississipi (near Memphis TN) and are planning to 10x the capacity [increasing the manufacturing space by 1.2M sq. ft](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/02/2325391/0/en/Mullen-Automotive-Begins-Expansion-Plans-for-1-2M-sq-ft-of-Additional-EV-Manufacturing-Space.html). 

&gt;Mullens Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering Facility (AMEC) currently occupies 124,000 square feet of manufacturing space. The total available land on the property is over 100 acres, and Mullen is moving ahead with plans to build out another 1.2 million square feet of manufacturing space to support class 1 and class 2 EV cargo vans and the Mullen FIVE EV Crossover.

4) Mullen is rolling out the Mullen Five (SUV crossover) with Lithium Sulphur battery technology and they are investing in Solid State battery tech. I'll be honest, I don't know what this means, but Lithium Sulphur seems to beat current EV tech in several measurable areas and it sounds like large Solid State batteries is a new frontier for battery technology.

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly for me, the **current market cap of MULN is less than $75 million**. Compare this to Rivian (mkt cap $123 BILLION) or Lucid (mkt cap $71 BILLION) and it's hard to imagine a world where MULN is not undervalued.

I believe once investors catch on to the fact that MULN is an EV and Battery company with the capacity to deliver on their product, it will achieve similar multiples to other major EV players. Even at a fraction of the multiples the stock still stands to increase in value considerably.

In my estimation the world debut of their electric SUV crossover this week will be the catalyst for the stock being valued as an EV company.

Polestar, an EV company that sells electric cars in Europe, wants to go public through a SPAC merger with Gores Guggenheim.

Polestar itself is, in my opinion, definitely worth more than 1.5 Billion dollars in Market Cap if you compare it to other EV stocks, like Lucid, Rivian or Fisker.

However, Gores Guggenheim has a market cap of only 1.5 Billion dollars. Surely, I'm missing something here? I'm quite certain that I'm missing something. If the merger goes through, what happens to the market cap and stock price of Gores Guggenheim? 

Will the MC just go to a few billion while the stock price stays the same? Will the stock disappear? I really don't know how this works.

1,"11/16/2021, 02:26:18",Opendoor is full of red flags,Striking-Menu-2491,"I believe Opendoor Technologies financial statements and investor communications provide false and/or misleading information about the financial performance of the company. The problems center around two main areas, the use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and a lack of disclosure regarding the companys portfolio of single-family homes.  

This post includes some background on the company/industry, a discussion of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures, a discussion of the inadequate disclosures and a brief summary.  

**Recent Events &amp; Background**

Opendoor is one of at least four public companies engaged in the business of buying and selling single family homes using automated pricing algorithms. Others include Zillow, Redfin and Offerpad. The companies aim to streamline the home buying and selling process by moving the buying and selling process online. They hope to buy homes, fix them up and then relist the homes with a 10-15% mark-up. Additionally, they hope to add additional services and fees to the transactions that will improve their revenue. Opendoor went public through a SPAC transaction last year and has been in business since 2014. The company had $2.3 billion in sales last quarter and has a balance sheet with $9.0 billion of assets ($6.3 billion of homes) and $6.6 billion of liabilities ($5.3 billion of SPE debt). At the beginning of 2021, Opendoor had real estate inventory of $465 million and $346 million of SPE debt. Opendoor is the largest of the four companies and is roughly 2x the number two, Zillow.

On November 2, Zillow announced it was exiting this business and taking total charges of over $569 million because the company had over-estimated the ultimate selling prices of homes in its portfolio.  The charges represent a roughly 8-10% discount to the original purchase prices. Zillow commented that the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated.''

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

Opendoors financial statements and investor communications focus heavily on several Non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit/Margin, Contribution Profit/Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA/Margin.  These measures serve to obscure the true nature of the business and the underlying financial performance of the company.  

Opendoors business model is to buy assets (homes) using significant financial leverage and to subsequently sell those assets at a profit. Additionally, they hope to capture fees around the buying/selling transactions to supplement their revenue. Banks, investment banks and finance companies have similar business models and similar balance sheets. However, most their assets generate income during the holding period. Banks make loans (assets) and hope to add additional non-interest fees and business to existing relationships. Unlike other financial institutions, Opendoor doesnt earn income from its portfolio of investments and must spend money to maintain the houses for maintenance, taxes, utilities and other items. 

By electing to focus on Contribution Margin and EBITDA Margin, the company seems to be trying to differentiate itself from other firms that generate income by financing assets on the balance sheet. This focus has the potential to mislead investors. When combined with the lack of disclosure, discussed below, the company is misrepresenting and omitting key information in their public filings and financial statements. The Non-GAAP measures can show positive results while the true performance is deteriorating. That started to happen this quarter and is the direct result of how Opendoor calculates Contribution Profit. Given the dramatic downturn in Zillows business, this is a potential red flag.

The Letter to Shareholders for 3rd Quarter 2021 proudly states (page 9 of Letter to Shareholders):

*Contribution Profit, which accounts for the direct selling and holding costs incurred on the homes sold during the quarter, was $170 million in 3Q21, up 33% versus 2Q21. Contribution Margin, which we view as an important measure of unit economics associated with a specific resale cohort, was 7.5% versus 10.8% in 2Q21.*

The contribution margin calculation adds the Inventory Valuation Adjustment to the Gross Margin. The Inventory Valuation Adjustment is a number that reflects the impairment of existing inventory (page 43 3rd Quarter 10Q). Some part of the homes on the balance sheet are now worth less than the original cost of the home and their value is now adjusted downward. This is similar to a loan loss reserve for banks or finance companies.  Imagine a bank saying their Net Interest Margin was great if it werent for the loan loss reserves. In future quarters, higher impairment charges will not have a negative impact on Adjusted Gross Margin or Contribution Margin. Because the company has framed itself in non-financial terms, they can continue to report positive Non-GAAP results even if portfolio quality declines.  The company is presenting false and misleading information about its financial reporting and will continue to do so with the existing focus on Non-GAAP measures.

The focus on Adjusted EBITDA has the same effect as the focus on Contribution Margin. It reframes the company as a non-financial business and seems to show positive cash flow (EBITDA) because of the add backs and adjustments. Costs for financing are central to the business model for this company. By adding interest financing costs and inventory impairment to GAAP Net Loss in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, the company is overstating its available cash flow significantly.  Most companies that report EBITDA numbers are showing they have cash available to support long term debt obligations. Although Opendoor has some long term debt, they seem to be using EBITDA to obscure the fact they are a financial company.  (page 45 of 3rd quarter 10Q).  

**Disclosure Issues**

The companys disclosures relating to its portfolio of homes makes it impossible to do any real analysis of the performance of these assets.  Additionally, some metrics that would usually be available for financial service firms and not presented by Opendoor. 

**Portfolio Aging**  The company presents a three line description of its portfolio on page 15 of the 3rd quarter 10Q.

The company should report aging of the homes in the portfolio. The aging is important in the credit facilities because it determines eligibility and potentially haircut for financing. For investors this would be a key metric to evaluate the company performance. This is especially important going into the seasonally slow period of the year.

**Inventory Impairment Detail ** There is no detail on the inventory impairment. However, it went from $942,000 in the 2nd quarter to $32,602,000 in the 3rd quarter. In previous quarters, the company apparently made more than anticipated on some homes with impairment. However, that information is hidden in the cash flow statement. Much like banks report loan loss reserves, Opendoor should detail impairments. This is especially true given the huge charges at Zillow and the dramatic rise in Opendoors impairments. I was able to review a sampling of homes available for sale in four markets. Based on a semi-random analysis of homes currently for sale, Opendoor has many homes for sale at or below the original purchase price. 

**Portfolio Concentration -** The company had 17,164 homes at the end of the 3rd quarter. Based on an initial review of property records in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Opendoor owns 1,724 homes in that county. If we added the surrounding counties to include the full Phoenix MSA, Opendoor would have a significant concentration of assets in that one market. Since this was where they started, its not surprising to see the high concentration, but portfolio diversification is key any investment strategy. Concentration should be disclosed. The company talks about being in 44 markets, but that figure misrepresents the real situation. 

**Portfolio Status**  Offerpad breaks down homes into three categories, homes listed for sale, home under renovation and homes under contract. This disclosure would help investors understand Opendoors performance.

**Negative Carry Metrics**  Since Opendoors assets have a significant cost of carry, in the form of financing costs, property taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance, and other items. Details on these costs should be available for investors. Much like banks and finance companies break out details of their interest income, Opendoor should provide detail on their negative carry costs. 

**Material Weakness**  On page 57 of the 3rd Quarter 10Q the company says:  

*Management identified control deficiencies that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to our information technology general controls over certain accounting and proprietary systems used in our financial reporting.*

Given the enormous ramp in the companys activity this year, it seems unlikely the disclosures on page 58 sufficiently address the issues. A financial services firm with thousands of properties to repair, maintain and resell needs rock solid systems and controls. That needs more discussion in the disclosures. My analysis of several markets showed they my be under reserved for potential losses in the existing portfolio.  Given the weakness of systems and financial controls, this isnt surprising.

**Summary**

Opendoors financial statements and disclosures misrepresent the true nature and performance of the company. By focusing on Non-GAAP measures and limiting portfolio disclosure, the company obscures its true financial performance. Given the recent implosion of Zillows business and the historic issues of subprime mortgage companies, this company is full of red flags.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qumwcl/opendoor_is_full_of_red_flags/

Walmart has dramatically underperformed the market over the last 12 months despite incredible amounts of growth in the company. It is up 2.50% YTD versus Costco at 37%. It makes absolutely zero sense to have this wide of a divergence in performance with incredibly similar businesses. 

Comps are going to be killed led by Chase Freedom 5% this Q, Walmart+ being rolled out and Black Friday to come. My entire family spent $1,500 this Q there and loved Walmart+. 

There is tremendous upside to the company right now and is undervalued relative to other consumer discretionary comps and the stock market getting defensive with inflation.

Backblaze, Inc. is a cloud storage and data backup company, founded in 2007 by Gleb Budman, Billy Ng, Nilay Patel, Brian Wilson, Tim Nufire, Damon Uyeda, and Casey Jones. It IPO'd last week and nobody's even given it a mention on this sub.

Frankly, I'm disappointed in you all. The meme potential for $BLZE alone is worth investing in, nevermind the actual rock fuckng solid fundementals and growth potential.

Backblaze is one of the cheapest cloud storage providers out there. The name might ring a bell, they're the little darling of /r/Datahoarder, partly because they're cheap and partly because they release regular statistics on [hard drive failure rates](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-hard-drive-stats-for-2020/).

The product is solid, it's API compatible with Amazon S3 which means it's trivial for a developer to swap them in and immediately pay 1/4 of what their closest competitor charges.

I use them myself. I backup all my porn to B3, the tune of about 500GB worth and it costs near fuck all:

The CEO and founder, Gleb Budman, has got balls bigger than you. This IPO happened just because he [wanted to prove that it could be done](https://www.businessinsider.com/backblaze-cloud-storage-ipo-on-little-vc-revenue-2021-11?r=US&amp;IR=T) without an absurd amount of VC capital. $13M (total) is the only VC funding $BLZE took before going public. And why do it like this? Because he wanted people to work efficiently, not waste money sitting in a big pile. I would throw shade here at the numerous other darlings on this sub that raised a fuckton of money and pissed it all away trying to find a viable business model, but there's just so many to choose from I won't bother, you get the point. 

There's a viable business model here. There's a huge market demanding to be served.

**Steady foundations within minimal investment required to prep for massive growth.**

Growth of their core product is up 62% year on year and they're just getting started. Cloud is a growth market, there's tens of billions of dollars in cloud storage alone and Backblaze has barely scratched at it, pulling in  $53.78M last year.

On the downside, that lead to a $6.6M loss. BackBlaze has posted losses for the last couple of years, but growth is still up and it's only getting started. Hard Drives aren't cheap (But they are getting cheaper!).

It doesn't matter what business you're in, you need storage. Even cryptos need storage (and they use a lot of it), the market is only going to grow from here on and BackBlaze is in the perfect position to capture a tonne of it.

It IPO'd at $16, by the end of the day it was already at $20 and as I write this the price is sitting at $25.

I'm clearly not the only person that sees the value on offer here and the potential of this fantastic company, how high can it go? With revenues of less than $60M in an industry worth Billions, as high as you can get. Figuratively and literally.

Most importantly, $420 isn't just a meme, it's a viable target so you can literally $420 $BLZE it

* Huge growth potential 
* Solid foundations

EVgo stock tumbles after BofA says sell, citing recent EV charging euphoria and pending lockup expiry

 Shares of EVgo Inc. took a dive Monday, after BofA Securities analyst Ryan Greenwald questioned the recent charging euphoria that triggered a near-doubling in the electric-vehicle charging companys stock last week, at a time that investors should be worried about a potential significant amount of shares that could be sold.

The stock **EVGO,** **-16.14%** tumbled 14.9% in midday trading, on volume that already surpassed the full-day average. The stock had rocketed 89.4% last week amid investor optimism over the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that included billions of dollars for EV charging and after the company reported a surprise third-quarter profit.

The company had also announced last week expansions of its collaboration with auto maker General Motors Co. **GM,** **-0.08%** and its partnership with ride-sharing company Uber Technologies Inc. **UBER,** **-2.66%**

During the day the stock fluctuated 6.19% from a day low at $1.29 to a day high of $1.37. The price has been going up and down for this period, and there has been a -1.48% loss for the last 2 weeks. Volume has increased on the last day along with the price, which is a positive technical sign, and, in total, 10 thousand more shares were traded than the day before. In total, 137 thousand shares were bought and sold for approximately $182.73 thousand.

The stock lies in the lower part of a very wide and weak rising trend in the short term, and this may normally pose a very good buying opportunity. If the lower trend floor at $1.28 is broken, it will firstly indicate a slower rate of rising, but may also be an early warning for a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 7.5% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $1.38 and $1.74 at the end of this 3-month period.

1,"11/16/2021, 00:59:04",Does Ryan Cohens Newest Tweet reveal a potential MOASS date? (Theory),meekie18,"So, I know we have probably all seen that Ryan Cohen tweeted roughly 10 hours ago.

Now, I know it's simple to see this tweet as just a ""funny joke"" written backward but I think it's more than that.

If we look at the letters as values using the **Gematria Values** we can see some interesting things come to light.

**Gematria Values:** Gematria is a Jewish form of numerology in which the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are substituted with corresponding numbers. The first ten letters are given number values that increase consecutively from 1 to 10. The next eight letters are given number values that increase by a factor of ten from 20 to 90.

**Eew Eew Llams A Evah I** in Jewish Gematria equals: **2705**

**Eew Eew Llams A Evah I** in English Gematria equals: **1014**

**Eew Eew Llams A Evah I** in Simple Gematria equals **169 &lt;----** *what are the chances!*

Now here are some phrases that match the same Gematria values:

*Concentrate On What Is Pure And Good Ignore The* *Rest* = **2705** in Jewish Gematria (basically saying Buy, HODL, and DRS)

*The Clues Are Everywhere* *=* **2705** in Jewish Gematria (too specific to be a coincidence)

*What Prophecy Am I Supposed To Fulfill* = **2705** in Jewish Gematria

Twin Flames Both Born On **December Seventh** = **2705** in Jewish Gematria

It Takes A Lot To Rattle Wall Street I Fixed It = **2705** in Jewish Gematria (this one is crazy)

If You Don't Believe You're Retarded Fr = **2705** in Jewish Gematria (if you don't believe in MOASS you are intellectually disabled)

But then I found something interesting:

The phrase *The Time Is Coming* *= 1014 in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria

*Coronavirus = 1014 in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria

I'm Done Being Quiet *= 1014 in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria

Okay, so I was a bit skeptical at first but found a lot more crazy coincidences.

What other words/phrases have the same value?

***December Nineteenth*** *= 1014 in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria

and 12/19/2021 is a Saturday

and what else has the same values?

***Holy Saturday*** *= 1014 in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria

also,

***World War December*** *in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria.

and then when I dove a bit deeper, I found another interesting phrase that matched the Jewish Gematria value of **Eew Eew Llams A Evah I.**

This one is crazy, okay, ready?

**""Maybe If U Guys Hodld Women Like U""** = **2705** in Jewish Gematria

I think Ryan Cohen wants us to know that to get a female partner we need to HODL our $GME shares

then also i looked at more phrases that had the values of *1014 in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria.

this one is crazy, **""March Eleven Friday""** had the values of *1014 in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria.

**March 11th, 2022? Yup, it's a Friday!**

also we have

**Three Zero Eight** had the values of *1014 in* English Gematria **AND** 169 in Simple Gematria.

which gives us another possible date

March 08, 2022

so we got a few dates (i know, no dates) from this tweet:

***December*** ***19th, 2021***

December ***7th, 2021***

both dates are in **December.**

then we have some dates in March

**March 11th, 2022**

**March 8th, 2022**

and also, the hidden message of:

**""Maybe If U Guys Hodld Women Like U""**

points towards Ryan Cohen telling Apes to HODL

Is Ryan Cohen trying to sneakily tell us that MOASS will be in December or March?

probably not, but i was bored in class and felt like doing this so...

you are welcome.

I basically didn't know what the stock market was until Friday, and spent the weekend cramming as much info as I can, so I'm making this thread to see if I'm misinterpreting that info and about to do something dumb as a result .





The plan:





I'm gonna watch BFLY when the market opens. During the largest dip I see in the first two minutes, I'm gonna put $40 in. Then when there's a spike, I'm going to sell, supposedly gaining more money than the $40 I had initially (if it goes as planned).



It is my understanding that the stock goes up when a lot of people buy it, which increases the price of the shares (meaning its a good time to sell), and when a lot of people sell, there's a drop, which makes the stock cost less (making it a good time to buy).

**PART 1: Intro**

Hello my fellow WSB friends. Looks like the market has been doing great this week lol. But of course, none of you are capable of making money on your own. So here I am to share

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6zq6bu6dsz71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4990e6342c8e1f6e94cb799daab4aee09a8a83ff

**PART 2: The Company**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img d9zmh849dsz71...*

Sooo What is GGPI? They are a SPAC known as Gores-Guggenheim Inc., backed by Gores Group and Guggenheim Partners. GGPI is bringing Polestar public, which is a Swedish electric vehicle company that has ACTUAL REVENUE from vehicle sales worldwide! They have delivered well over 20,000 vehicles so far, and they are projected to have a revenue of $1.6B this year.

Here you can see some sales data from Europe, not included are the sales in China and North America:

&amp;#x200B;

[Polestar Car Sales \( They actually sell cars! Yes!\)](https://preview.redd.it/0u31l63adsz71.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32a757f3640f7f67d8b422fca950432e1341114a)

&amp;#x200B;

[Polestar Revenue \(They actually make money unlike other EVs!\)](https://preview.redd.it/hyrhe7cddsz71.png?width=1176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0289a5b6056828516d422197c307bb07eba3722)

The table shows the numbers in million SEK, **Polestar did $636 million USD in revenue in 2020 which is slated to grow by 151% in 2021 to $1.6B**. Thats BEFORE the release of the Polestar 3, their new SUV which will be made in the USA in Ridgeville, NC, as well as their 4th model which is the Polestar Precept. It is a full-size electric sedan comparable to an S-Class or the Lucid Air in size. If you dont get any Bladerunner vibes from it, please ask your wife's boyfriend to watch that movie with you.

**PART 3: THE SPONSORS**

Guggenheim Partners is a massive investment bank with over $250B AUM. They are well-known within the industry with a great reputation. Ever heard of the Guggenheim Museum for modern art in New York? They belong to the big boys club.

The Gores Group is a highly prolific and successful SPAC sponsor. Theyve created a pipeline of SPACs with an amazing hit rate. They have an average 28.2% average and 20.9% medium return on their SPACs.

Oh yeah just to mention: GGPI is by far the biggest SPAC in terms of trust size backed by Gores Group. Great things are about to happen.

**PART 4: THE BIG BOYS (Institution Holdings) &amp; (Leadership)**

**(Thank you** [u/Zooomr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Zooomr/) **for the info)**

Some of the big players in GGPI that weve all heard of are:

TD Asset Management - 500,000 shares

Deutsche Bank - 608,174 shares

Goldman Sachs - 50,000 shares

UBS - 1,000,000 shares

Weiss Asset Management - 750,000 shares

Saba Capital Management - 2,399,090 shares

Citadel - 2,751,557 shares

Credit Suisse - 60,000 shares

Millennium Management - 1,385,634 shares

D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. - 416,666 shares

Bank of America - 150,000 shares

In terms of ownership, Here's who we've got and who they are affiliated with

* Alec Gores / Gores Group
* Mark Stone / Gores Group
* **Andrew M. Rosenfield / Guggenheim Partners President**
* Andrew McBride / Gores Group
* Randall Bort / Gores Group
* **Elizabeth Marcellino / Additional board member, who brings unique expertise**
* **Nancy Tellem / Additional board member, who brings unique expertise**

**Why did I highlight the people above?**

They are the ""interesting faces that bring additional expertise above and beyond what we usually see in a Gores space. So just who are these people? I will copy and paste info from the S1 to answer that.

**Andrew M. Rosenfeld**

* Mr. Rosenfield is the **President of Guggenheim Partners**,
* He is responsible for many aspects of firm management and strategic planning and leads the firms principal transactions. Mr. Rosenfield is also a Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School, whose faculty he joined in 1986. From 2010 through 2018, while remaining a Managing Partner at Guggenheim Partners,
* Mr. Rosenfield was the founder and Chief Executive Officer of TGG Group, a behavioral economics consulting firm.
* From 1977 until 2001, Mr. Rosenfield was the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Lexecon Inc. (now known as Compass Lexecon), a leading law and economics consulting firm.
* From 1999 until its sale in 2004, Mr. Rosenfield was the founder and Chief Executive Officer of UNext Inc., an early online education business that partnered with Columbia University, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, Carnegie Mellon University, and the London School of Economics.

Bottom line, impressive resume. Hes the President of Guggenheim Partners, and he's on the board of this SPAC. That carries weight in terms of both raising capital for a PIPE, and also the quality of potential targets.

**Nancy Tellem**

* Ms. Tellem is the Executive Chairperson of Eko, a media network that reimagines storytelling by using proprietary technology to create interactive stories that respond and leverage the interactive nature of todays media devices
* In addition, **as a board member of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Holdings Inc.** (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) **since** **2013**, Nancy expanded her role from January through July 2019, becoming Executive Director to the Office of the CEO to help develop the overall long-term strategy for the company.
* Until October of 2014, Ms. Tellem was President of Xbox Entertainment Studios where she oversaw Microsofts TV strategy and created a studio focused on the development and production of interactive programming.
* From 1997 to 2012, Ms. Tellem was **President of the CBS Network Television Entertainment Group**. She oversaw both CBS Entertainment Network and CBS Studios.
* Before CBS, Ms. Tellem was the **Executive Vice President of Business and Financial Affairs for Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.** where she shepherded in such hits as ER and Friends.
* Ms. Marcellino has also served as a member of the board of directors of Gores Holding VI since June 2020 and will continue to do so until the pending completion of the Matterport acquisition

**PART 5: Fundamentals**

Gores has a great SPAC track record

* $38 billion of transaction value across eight completed/announced transactions
* $6 billion of new cash equity delivered across eight completed/announced transaction
* 13 SPACs raised to date, totaling $5.7 billion (prior to PIPE commitments)

This is a great opportunity to get in early / lots of upside for shareholders

* Polestar shareholders compelling valuation and upside potential from rollover shares and earnout
* New investors get an attractive entry with long-term return potential

One thing about GGPI/Polestar is that this is something you can hold forever unlike those SHORT SQUEEZE TO THE MOON SPACs that are absolutely worthless and die after the squeeze. You can see the redemption rate for Gore SPACs below

**PART 6: SOME COMMON QUESTIONS REGARDING GGPI/POLESTAR**

* Why would Polestar go public with a SPAC rather than a traditional IPO?

The reason for this is because a SPAC deal allows Polestar to benefit from the support, experience, resources, and expertise of the Gores Guggenheim team, being backed by a great sponsor means a better future for Polestar

* Why did Polestar decide to become a public company now?

Polestar believes going public right now would accelerate their strategy and they expect rapid growth in the near future, some of their plans include:

1. Launch 3 new cars by year-end 2024
2. Build sales to approximately 290,000 cars per year-end 2025
3. Expand global distribution footprint to 30 markets by year-end 2023
4. Execute on sustainability commitment with the target of creating a truly climate-neutral car by year-end 2030 and being the MOST TRANSPARENT PURE EV COMPANY

* Since 49.5% of Polestar is owned by Volvo, a Chinese company, would it be accurate to describe Polestar as a Chinese company?

The answer is simply No. Polestar is a Swedish premium electric performance car brand that is headquartered in Sweden with a global presence. While the Chinese market is important for polestar, their main growth focus is in the market in Europe and North America. Polestars holding company will be in the UK and they will be listed on the Nasdaq in the United States backed by top-tier institutional investors.

Polestar has made great progress separating Polestar brand from Volvo car over the past four years, their relationship is conducted on an arms-length basis

**PART 7: PRICE TARGET**

Oh yeah my favorite part of writing a DD!

Heres the price target:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kcaqyqkqdsz71.png?width=737&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d48ec151c6c18aef86c1eced05f910474607a40

Being an EV SPAC with actual existing vehicle production and revenue, I believe GGPI/Polestar will at least hit $20 once it gets more attention. We were able to get 32M in trading volume on the first day after the deal announcement. Combine that with the 50M combined volume since the merger rumor and its safe to say that most of the arbs are already out of GGPI and we could shoot straight up.

There are also a ton of open interest for GGPI dec/jan calls. Keep in mind, for every calls you buy from the hedgies, they have to buy shares to achieve delta-natural, so the more they buy the higher the stock price goes, this is gamma squeeze baby. TO THE MOON!!!

**PART 8: POSITION &amp; DISCLOSURES:**

1600 Warrants @ 1.99, added 1500 more on the way up

Holding until we are at the moon

Disclosure: I am not a financial advisor, please do your own due diligence before investing.

TLDR: Buy GGPI/Polestar, the next tesla!!

**A poem for our beloved Gores:**

Our papa gores

Who art in the Beverly hill

Hallowed be thy wallet

Thy merger come

Thy DA be done

On mainstreet as it is on wallstreet

Give us our daily tendies

And forgive us our paper hands

As we forgive those who paperhand unto us

And lead us not into bankruptcy

But deliver us from poverty

For our money

Our asses

Are yours

1,"11/16/2021, 00:24:50",BLZE,SauceDragon2020,"Backblaze went public last week after generating just $16 million in revenue in the second quarter.

The company is valued at under $1 billion even after its IPO pop.

Backblaze shares climbed 24% in their debut on Thursday, another 12% on Friday and 25% today, lifting the price to $27 and giving the company a market cap of around $800 million.

Over 100 technology companies have listed on U.S. exchanges this year and, by the standards of its peers, Backblaze is a micro-cap. At least 21 tech companies to debut in 2021 are worth over $10 billion.Coinbaseis valued above $70 billion,Robloxis over $50 billion andAffirmtopped $40 billion.

Those companies all routinely tapped venture investors for hefty amounts of capital on their way to the public exchanges. Backblaze, by contrast, had raised less than $3 million from outside investors between its formation in 2007 and earlier this year, when itissued $10 millionin convertible notes.

One of Backblazes competitors isAmazon, the worlds fourth most valuable U.S. company. Amazon has been one of the great growth stories over the 25 years, expanding from online bookseller to giant e-commerce site to full-stack technology platform.

Backblaze executives had other reasons to go public in a highly-competitive market that features the biggest cloud services in the world from Amazon,MicrosoftandGoogle. Backblaze currently stores two exabytes of data  thats 2 million terabytes  and has a half-million paying customers.
Budman said the IPO presented a clear opportunity to open Backblazes books to customers and prove that its mature enough to be a long-term technology provider. He said the fresh capital will help the company expand its sales team as it faces off against industry heavyweights. Its B2 business, which competes with Amazons S3 cloud storage offering, grew 61% in the second quarter.

Let's assume you decide you want to randomly invest. You create 3 random number generators, 1 to pick what you're investing in, 1 to determine how much, and 1 to determine when to buy/ sell. You could also have one to determine what type of purchase to make. 

What do yall think the odds of making money are? 50/50? Very low? High? 

I'll never do this in the actual market but I am very curious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/quk1eo/odds_of_making_money_on_random_investments/

Look at previous insider buys of companies like $SOFI, $ASAN, and $TSLA, all led to large improvements in price in the following months. I think the market overreacted to the most recent earnings quarter I have been buying in the 68-71 dollar range.

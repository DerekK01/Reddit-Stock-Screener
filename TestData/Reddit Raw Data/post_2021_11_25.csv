# New Coronavirus Variant a Serious Concern in South Africa

By  [Prinesha Naidoo](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AT4lGFNecyc/prinesha-naidoo)  and  [S'thembile Cele](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AU8puCGvjMA/sthembile-cele)   November 25, 2021, 6:00 AM EST                   Updated on              November 25, 2021, 8:07 AM EST   

&amp;#x200B;

 

Scientists in South Africa are studying a recently identified [new coronavirus variant](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R34QH9T0G1KW)  that is a cause for serious concern, stoking fears the country may face  a potentially severe fourth wave that could spread internationally.

The  new discovery, called B.1.1529 until a Greek letter is assigned,  carries an unusually large number of mutations and is clearly very  different from previous incarnations, Tulio de Oliveira, a  bio-informatics professor who runs gene-sequencing institutions at two  South African universities, said at a briefing on Thursday. 

Here is a mutation variant of serious concern,  Health Minister Joe Phaahla said at the same media event. We were  hopeful that we might have a longer break in between waves -- possibly  that it would hold off to late December or even next year January.

Virologists have detected almost 100 cases linked  to the variant in the country to date, said Anne von Gottberg, clinical  microbiologist &amp; head of respiratory diseases at the National  Institute for Communicable Diseases. World Health Organization officials  have met to discuss the virus, which has also been detected in  Botswana, according to a separate statement.

 

The new variant is likely to have evolved during a  chronic infection of an immuno-compromised person, possibly in an  untreated HIV/AIDS patient, Francois Balloux, director of the UCL  Genetics Institute, said in a statement published by the Science Media  Centre. The worlds biggest number of HIV cases has complicated South  Africas efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, as  immuno-compromised people can harbor the virus for longer, scientists  say.

 

The findings come as several European countries [battle a renewed surge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-24/singapore-cases-rise-morgan-stanley-reimbursement-virus-update)  in Covid-19 case numbers, with hospitals in some German cities starting  to feel the strain. Governments are considering a fresh round of  restrictions, largely against the unvaccinated, to try and curb the  spread. South Africa is currently on the lowest level of lockdown  measures, though the new variant prompted the cabinet and coronavirus  council to call a meeting for the weekend.

One key  difference is that while European countries have broadly got  vaccination levels to a healthy majority and have moved on to booster  shots, only about 35% of South African adults are fully inoculated. The  health department has even asked [Johnson and Johnson](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JNJ:US) and [Pfizer Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PFE:US) to hold off on new deliveries due to a slump in demand.

The rest of Africa is in an even worse position,  with only 6.6% of the continents population fully vaccinated, Africa  CDC Director John Nkengasong said at a virtual briefing. The challenge  of securing supplies has given way to a lack of demand, with about 45%  of the 403 million doses delivered to the continent yet to be  administered, he said.

### Rising Cases

South  Africa has started to see a pick up in Covid-19 case numbers,  particularly in the most-populous province of Gauteng. There were 1,275  infections recorded on Wednesday, up from less than 900 the previously  day, with more than 1,000 detected in the hub that includes Johannesburg  and Pretoria.

While the government opted for a  very strict lockdown at the start of the pandemic in March 2020,  subsequent curbs have generally been driven by hospitalization rates. A  prefered tactic is to ban the sale of alcohol, as it spares health  centers from the burden of drink-related accidents and fights.

The  outbreak of the new variant is at an early stage and studies are  ongoing, but officials do expect, unfortunately, to start seeing  pressure in the healthcare system in the next few days and weeks, De  Oliveira said.

""Wearing a white T-shirt, KoGuan laid out a no-frills roadmap to his trading riches: stick to a single stock, in this case, Tesla; keep doubling down; and, most important, believe in Elon Musk. 

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, KoGuan says. Fortunately, I win more of the time than I lose. 

Then markets cratered and his stake was almost wiped out in a cascade of margin calls. 

I lost almost everything, KoGuan said. 

He kept buying, following what he described as a simple playbook: buy short-term in-the-money stock options;take the profits when the stock goes up; use some of those proceeds to buy actual shares  and plow the rest into another options bet. In other words, double down again and again and again.""

1,"11/25/2021, 22:50:17",[IDEA] Make bank using USDT,KieronWiltshire,"#  Idea

So the first thing's first, let me just start by saying that this idea revolves around the fact Tether has around 80bn in circulation despite the claims that they do not hold 80bn in reserve.

US Senator Sherrod Brown who is the banking committee chairman has asked that stable coins open up about their processes, calling for greater transparency on how stable coins are minted as distributed. He's also given a response deadline by December the 3rd. I am concerned that if Tether fails to adequately respond or show that they hold a good amount of reserves then the price of Tether could potentially tank on the basis that no one would use it. The demand would be left dry whilst the supply is dumped causing the price to drop. If more Tether is then printed, we run into hyperinflationary waters where the quotes against other cryptocurrencies runaway to extreme prices against Tether.

So my proposal is that on the 2nd of December, the trade would entail leveraging up on exchanges against USDT and using the leverage to purchase other cryptocurrencies such as BNB. On the 3rd, if Tether shows to be stable, the conversion would remain the same and you could sell your assets to pay off the debt. Now from what I understand, the potential loss is whatever you put in since you're levered right up. However, if I'm correct and Tether crashes, in theory you should be able to sell a small portion of your BNB to pay off any out-standing debt. You would then be able to pocket the rest of the BNB moving it from your margin accounts into cold wallets.

**Example:**

You deposit 1,000 USDT and borrow 10x leverage to receive 10,000 USDT. You then purchase $10,000 worth of BNB (You may want to purchase less just encase volatility requires you to post more collateral in order for you to remain within the margin requirements).

You wait for Tether to drop. You would then be able to sell some of your BNB to purchase Tether back at extremely low prices, so effectively purchasing back 1 USDT for 0.00001 of it's asking price, effectively securing your 10,000 USDT for next to nothing.

You could then repay the 10,000 USDT liabilities whilst still keeping the majority of the BNB. Once your liabilities have been paid, your assets then become yours to transfer where you please.

# Disclaimer

So let me begin by saying that I'm not 100% sure about this but I could do with some advise, so I'm encouraging discussion on this and hopefully someone will be able to clarify whether or not it could potentially work out or if there are any further associated risks I have not considered.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r1y6x8/idea_make_bank_using_usdt/

here's my reasons why it'll go back up: it's a solid company that has a product people want. what's affecting their stock price isn't product problems, it's personnel problems, and getting rid of a couple of dumbasses can fix personnel problems pretty quickly. most people want to achieve, once the roadblocks are removed. they don't have to strip the company to change it, is what I'm saying.

on the other hand, xbox and playstation might have reasons to stop doing business with activision, and now that there's an opening to do that, they might cut activision out completely. i think that's an extremely small possibility, but what do I know?

1,"11/25/2021, 22:17:20",MCF: John Goff v. KKR,seae7e,"Follow this story. Legendary deal maker John Goff owns a controlling interest in an energy company called Contango. It trades as MCF. He decides that they can do better deals if they are bigger. A deal is made with a company called Independence, which is not publicly traded and owned by KKR. The deal is that the two companies will be combined, where Contango shareholders own about 25% and Independence owns 75% after the merger. Contango was trading for about $5.70 per share making the equity value about $1.15B when they made the deal. 
But wait. Now the stock is $3.78, about 40 percent less. So someone who buys an MCF share (Contango) gets converted to a combined company share at a huge discount.  This means that if John Goff negotiated a good deal before, the deal just got much better for new shareholders.  The merger vote by Contango is December 6, and the merger will supposedly happen the next day. 

One other interesting thing. The combined company will change its name to Crescent and John will remain Chairman of the Board. Crescent is Johns marquis business name. He is showing that he will make this work and betting his reputation. 

I bought a ton of shares at $3.78 this week.  My guess is that it should revert to the equivalent of $5.70 after the merger on the 7th of December, maybe much more. Because the exchange ratio is .2 to one new share, what I am actually saying is Contango shareholders made a deal at $28.50 per new share of Crescent, the combined company, but new shareholders get to buy in at $18.90. My bet is that it goes up 50% post merger. What am I missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r1xipe/mcf_john_goff_v_kkr/

&amp;#x200B;

Sineng had an excellent performance and being one of the 2 inverter manufacturers to win a 5.5 GW inverter procurement tender in September 2021 by the Chinese state-owned mining and energy company  China Energy Investment Corporation, with Sineng winning orders of 1.1 GW of central inverters and Huawei secured orders for 4.4 GW of string inverters. This proves that Sineng is one of its kind among competitors of its size in the business and with Beijings commitment to corner the global solar panel- and inverter market with policies to create supply and demand, Sineng is on the right track to grow exponentially for the coming years.

&amp;#x200B;

Sinengs capabilities include its continuous automation, its scale and scope economies, cooperative partnerships as well as a fixed standardization of products to offer those at a competitive market price in the B2B business. Sineng is a preferred company in Chinese government tenders and the firm invests substantially in R&amp;D to secure an innovation and first-mover advantage over their competitors\[34\].Chinas Solar- and Energy storage industries are set up for success and Sineng Electric is likely to benefit from that.

1,"11/25/2021, 20:03:16",How Can I Give Reality Check To My ''Sigma Male'' Nephew ?,74538,"My nephew is a teenager, this year he made around %3000-%4000 profit on meme coins with a small amount of money. After that he bought himself a designer suit, fake Rolex, fake followers on Instagram and Tiktok. A few months ago, he came to my house and took hundreds of pictures with different clothes to share until next year. He is now selling trading/investing courses on a site and giving financial advices while making a good amount of money for a teenager. But, he is failing every class and probably will fail SAT too.

I have talked with my lawyer about his situtation, and consequences that can happen. According to him, he may even go to a state prison if someone sues him for a big amount of money.

Last week we had an argument. I have a private Instagram account that I only follow family members and close friends. Because of his increasing follower base I had to remove him from my Instagram for not being associated with him. He sent me a message asking me why I removed him, after telling why, he told me exactly this ''Sigma males don't need other people, no worries''. I still can't believe to the things I'm hearing from him. He became a different person after getting into this meme coin cult.

His parents are middle class and on the softer side, so he did not listen their advices and continued to invest in stupid coins, and now his parents have hopes that he may become a millionaire. Even though he doesn't tell the exact amount of money he has, I'm assuming that it's more money than his parents have in their bank account. Because his parents opened his account with parential consent, they can stop all the transactions and withdraw all the money, but they won't do it to not effect his life goals...

I did a really long talk with him yesterday. He told me about his plans, and it's so dumb. He is waiting for Elon Musk to tweet about next meme coin so he can multiply his money and become a millionaire while growing up his ''financial advice'' business. Also he is hoping to go to Stanford or Harvard by showing his ''entrepreneurship'' on shitcoins, then drop out and start his own cryptochain with his friends and become billionaires. When I told him that it was just luck that he made profit, he told me that dinasours will not understand the cryptomarket, and he made a profit in a month that I will never make in 10 years...

Even though he is a disrespectful dumbass, he will waste his life by doing this. He will either go broke, or get sued by someone for bad financial advice. I can't believe that there are sites letting him sell financial courses and give financial advice. Sad thing is that his parents are literally not stopping him from doing this because they don't believe that someone can sue them over cryptostuff, and he can lose all the money.

There is no possiblity of me recommending him to someone, so if he doesn't go to a college he will be working for a minimum-wage job.

Any advices ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r1v404/how_can_i_give_reality_check_to_my_sigma_male/

In the first half of this year I opened up a cash account with Merrill edge and tried my hand at day trading. After losing about 5k I decided to stop using real money and just do paper trading for a while until I get better. After looking through previous monthly statements I realized I was making an extremely high volume of trades. Everyday taking positions in small chunks. Sometimes buying and selling 5 shares at a time dozen of times in a row. Over the course of 6 months i traded the amount of individual trades could easily have added up to several thousands. My question is when Merrill edge says unlimited commission free trades on stocks is it really unlimited or will I be paying for hidden fees come tax season or something unforeseen like that.

[can I stop climate crisis by not eating meat?](https://preview.redd.it/6q2zmvp1do181.jpg?width=1199&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3504764ce038fe58820792c629732aefb91d9bc1)

 

The concept of your personal carbon footprint was popularized by the oil producer BP in a 2005 ad campaign. Arguably one of the most effective and sinister pieces of propaganda that still seriously distracts all of us from the reality of the situation.

I feel this is true as we are confronted with so much pressure from all around to make us feel guilty:

""stop eating meat - don't you know the carbon footprint is to high for meat"" 

""don't always fly on vacation by plane!""

""stop driving your car so much - go by bus instead"" ......

But if you eliminated 100% of your emissions for the rest of your life, you would save one seconds worth of emissions from the global energy sector. Even the most motivated person cant even make a tiny dent. 

[If I eliminated 100&amp;#37;.... so If I eliminate only 10&amp;#37; by not eating meat it's even less](https://preview.redd.it/v9tnxj58fo181.png?width=1302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a8c153a34332716a1ce9f7b70b8503e34632619)

So what can we do (in addition to this one second xD

The sctuctural problems have to be solved. An industry not relying on fossil fuels.

Vote in elections for a greener futer:

In Germany the green party was elected and is now part of the new federal government.

In the US President Biden dedicates $9.5bn for the hydrogen industry with his $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Bill.

&amp;#x200B;

Vote with your money (investing): 

""Hydrogen can replace current high-carbon in many areas as fuel. It could be able to meet a big chunk of industrial energy demand, used in hydrogen-powered transport or as an energy storage medium that allows for renewable energy to be stored in a supply-based and flexible manner or hydrogen produced with green electricity might be used for heating homes""

I invested in Nel, a leader in the hydrogen industry (Fueling, Elektrolyseurs, H2-Production...). As we see the oil prices rising an substitute like hydrogen is getting even more intresting. And the Nel Stock has not yet reached it's potential. In comparison to ""plug power"" and ""fuelcell energy"" ""Nel""  could reach a stock price around 12$.

Or any other new tec that could benefit a greener futer. Carbon capture. Solar Power and other renewables... These technologies are expensive to buy now but investing early can drive down the prices later.... so e.g. everybody/the industry can buy cheaper hydrogen for homes planes ships cars in the future...

&amp;#x200B;

[the prices for renewables are already falling](https://preview.redd.it/80nsdetpuo181.jpg?width=982&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda0109629b42039721160ffefed38d6e25e7096)

 

What I find most disturbing is that the big investing funds still go bold on oil coal and gas stocks. Who then (BP) shift the responsibility to the little men and women. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's the same with Tesla. In the early state only a few invested in Tesla. But it made a difference and now Tesla is the biggest car company (market cap). And what is even more important everybody is building electric cars now even tho the old car producers like Ford and VW missed the shift to electric cars in the beginning. 

&amp;#x200B;

So investing really makes a difference. Not eating meat.... helps a little....

But I am eating meat again and without a bad conscience.

&amp;#x200B;

For tax loss purposes, I just sold all 200 shares now and plan to buy them back after 30 days (say January 1st 2022). My understanding is that this generates tax loss for 150 shares out of 200. The 50 shares I purchased during the last 30 days washes out some of the sold shares at a 1:1 ratio.

I've also purchased a Chinese internet ETF with 9% holding in BABA at the same time, but that is ""substantially different"" from just BABA shares so won't cause a wash sale.

*Is my understanding correct?*

What makes it difficult for me find a definite answer, is that I also have a tax-free account holding 50 shares of BABA purchased &gt;30 days ago. Do I need to sell this 50 shares to prevent a wash sale situation for the 200 shares I've already sold in my regular account? Because I can't claim any capital losses in this account, I try to avoid selling it if I don't have to.

Lastly I'm trading from Canada - but I'm pretty sure the rules around washed sales are very much the same.

The journey starts on a cold winter night in January. It is my birthday and in my drunken stupor, I proclaim to my friends that this will be the year I enlarge my small pp, get over my fear of woman and lose my virginity. Thus, I embarked on the journey of trying to understand what quantitive easing is. My hope was that understanding this magic term would lead me to great wealth that would cure me of my small pp and virginity. Spoiler alert, I do not have great wealth, my pp is the same size and I'm still a virgin. 

So help me God

For those of you who wish to also know this useless knowledge that I have obtained, buckle up because this is a long one. 

To start, we first need to understand ""how does the banking system works?"" 

# Banking 101

A bank has a balance sheet. On one side we have the banks assets and on the other, the liabilities. Here is a simple balance sheet:

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|Securities -- Government Debt (S)|Deposits (D)|
|Loans (L)||
|Reserves (R)||

Deposits are liabilities because the bank owes you that money. On the asset side, the bank holds securities (short term government debt, usually 1-3 months), loans (money to be paid back with interest) and reserves which is basically just cash (digital or physical). A simple way to calculate reserves is to do D - S - L = R. Works most of the time.

One other key concept, is the reserve ratio. This is a magic number set by central banks. If the reserve ratio is 10, that means that banks **must** have a minimum of 10% of the total deposits as reserves. So if I have 10,000 dollars in deposits, I must have 1,000 dollars in reserves.  

Now, banks have a special power that allows them to create more money. They use reserves as collateral to create a loan, which in turn creates a deposit, hence creating more money! Let's take the following example:

https://preview.redd.it/33nba8szrl181.png?width=2292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0572a1aef069da80c13800fd810a3520e6d38c7

In this example, Alice deposits 10,000 dollars into Bank A. Mr. John, in need of a pp enlargement surgery, takes out a 9000 dollar loan, which gets deposited into Mr. John's bank account at Bank A. Now, Mr. John takes out that money and gives it to Doctor Big D, who performs the surgery and puts that money into Bank B. So, let's walk through the balance sheets! Aren't we having fun??!?!?!?

Bank A: Alice deposits 10,000 dollars

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|10,000 (D)|
|0 (L)||
|10,000 (R)||

Bank A: Mr. John takes out a loan for 9,000 dollars

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|19,000 (D)|
|9,000 (L)||
|10,000 (R)||

Now at this point, Bank A has just created 9,000 dollars of new money. Because the money was put into Mr. John's bank account, the total amount of reserves at this bank, have not yet decreased. In addition the reserve requirement went from 1000, to 1,900 dollars.

Bank A: Mr. John withdraws the 9,000 dollars for pp enlargement surgery

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|10,000 (D)|
|9,000 (L)||
|1,000 (R)||

Since Mr. John. withdrew this money, we now only have 1,000 dollars left in reserves (D - S - L = R), meaning Bank A can no longer create any new money through the creation of loans because they have no excess reserves (amount of reserves over the reserve requirement).

In the meantime Doctor Big D will deposit the 9,000 dollars at Bank B (Thanks for the op Doctor Big D!). These 9,000 dollars will become reserves that Bank B can use to create more loans and expand the amount of money in the system.

Bank B: Doctor Big D deposits the 9,000 dollars

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|9,000 (D)|
|0 (L)||
|9,000 (R)||

So what have we learned? Well, the banks use reserves as collateral to create loans, which create deposits, thus increasing the amount of money in the system. As the money works its way back into the banking system, those new deposits become reserves which can be used to create more loans. Depending on what the reserve requirement is, changes how much the money can be ""multiplied"" by. So a reserve requirement of 10, means we can multiple the base reserves in the system by a factor of 10 (theoretically). If we have 1,000 dollars of base reserves, it could eventually be turned into 10,000 dollars.

https://preview.redd.it/91q0rkrcyl181.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c162a986861f4b64afa2b12c12d30e8d1974cf

""So how do base reserves get created?"" We'll look at that in the quantitive easing section but first let's look at what happens when Mr. John starts paying back his loan. Then we'll look at the security part of the bank's balance sheet. After that, it is onward to the credit cycle, and quantitive easing.

**Loan repayment**

Loans are a sneaky son a bitch and help create demand for money because the loans have to be paid back with interest. This is one way, money derives its value (i.e. more demand, more valuable something is). Now when a loan is paid back, it destroys the amount of deposits in the banking system, thus lowering the amount of money.

So let's say, after Mr. John get his pp enlargement surgery, he finally has the balls to ask his manager for a raise due to the new found confidence from having a big dick. Due to this new raise, Mr. John starts paying back his loan to Bank A. 

Bank A: John gets a 1,000 dollar paycheck

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|11,000 (D)|
|9,000 (L)||
|2,000 (R)||

Bank A: John pays 1000 dollars back on his loan with 100 dollars going to interest

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|10,000 (D)|
|8,100 (L)||
|1,900 (R)||

So what happened here? Well, 900 dollars were removed from circulation since they are no longer deposits. Im addition, 100 dollars were paid as interest to bank A. As the bank pays their expenses with those 100 dollars, the 100 dollars just end up back in the banking system as deposits.

This leads to an important concept. As the amount of loans grow in the system the amount of money will expand and as those loans are paid back the amount of money in the system decreases. Or in male monkey talk, the more ass and boobies, pp expands, the less ass and boobies, pp contracts. 

**Securities**

Okie dokie, securities are not any different from loans. Banks need to pay interest to depositors (although this is pointless today), so when banks can't find people to give loans to (only so many pp enlargement surgeries to be had), they instead buy short term government debt. 

https://preview.redd.it/st52wbx2em181.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9736a12a5056dea1ad11a690031fc721dbb5c59

Let's say in the example above, AOC thought it was unfair some males had a small pp and other had a big pp. Thankfully, AOC, being the progressive she is, passed the bill, equal pp sizes for all. This bill reimburses men afflicted with the curse of a small pp. So back to the balance sheets.

Bank A: Starts off with 10,000 dollars in reserves

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|10,000 (D)|
|0 (L)||
|10,000 (R)||

Bank A: Buys 9000 dollars of government securities

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|9,000 (S)|10,000 (D)|
|0 (L)||
|1,000 (R)||

Bank A: The government reimburses Mr. John for the 9,000 dollar pp enlargement surgery by depositing the money into Bank A

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|9,000 (S)|19,000 (D)|
|0 (L)||
|10,000 (R)||

In this example, the money that the government borrows will work its way back into the bank system, thus increasing the total amount of deposits by 9,000 dollars, thus increasing the total amount of money. Much wow, very cool. For Americans this means we all own US debt \^.\^.

Now that we understand the basics of banking and how the money is created, let's move on to the next step, the credit cycle.

# The Credit Cycle

You've made it this far, and we still have a ways to go. Take a break, watch a youtube video, engage in that late modernity cest pool of dopamine. I certainly did at this point.

The creation of new money through debt is usually referred to as the ""expansion of credit."" As we expand the amount of credit in the economy, more and more debt is being taken on. Eventually, something is gonna go, wrong, very wrong. You see, Doctor Big D had a boom in business after AOC passed the equal pp sizes for all bill. So Doctor Big D took on lots and lots of debt to expand the number of clinics he ran. However, eventually the pp enlargement business faced a great bust. There was simply not enough pps left to enlarge!   

Everything starts going south. Doctor Big D, unable to pay back his debt, blows his brains out. His business, ""Big Ds for All"" goes under. His army of 10,000 pp enhancers all lose their jobs. No longer can they make their debt payments. Banks across the nation panic as mortgage default rates start increasing. They tighten up their lending standards. Companies, start panicking and cutting cost by laying off workers. Suddenly those workers don't have money to pay back their debts. More defaults! The economy enters free fall as everyone cuts spending, hordes dollars, and pray they'll have enough money to service their debts in this credit contraction.

Yikes! Now, who the fuck wants to live through that? Not me AND ESPECIALLY NOT BOOMERS. So this is where where the FED (or whatever the fuck your central bank is called) comes in with its big bad ass weapon, quantitive easing.

You can skip this part, and go to quantitive easing but if you want to see how a bank goes insolvent during a credit contraction, we gotta look at the balance sheet. FUCK, I hate these things.

Bank B: Life is good

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|120,000 (D)|
|90,000 (L)||
|30,000 (R)||

Let's say this is Bank B, before Doctor Big D kills himself and Big Ds for All goes under. They've loaned 70,000 of that 90,000 to Big Ds For All. 

Bank B: Big Ds for All defaults  

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|120,000 (D)|
|20,000 (L)||
|30,000 (R)||

O dingis in my kungbunghole! Bank B, now only has 50,000 dollars in assets but 120,000 dollars in liabilities. They'll never get enough money back in the form of loan repayments to pay back their depositors. This is how a bank enters insolvency.

# Quantitative Easing

Shit, this has taken all morning. My brain is shot... Here, I made a video on my anal abscess [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPu8rvk3QZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPu8rvk3QZc). I gotta pretend to work for a bit.

Okay, where did I leave off, ahh yes! Quantitative Easing. So remember that question you had, ""So how do base reserves get created?"" Well, this is where central banks come in. They're the bank for the banks. Thus central banks also have their own balance sheet (GOD DAMMIT).

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|Government Bonds and Securities (S)|Base Money Supply (B)|
|Loans to Banks (L)||
|Other Assets (A) -- mortgage backed securities, stonks, teslas, gold, whatever ||

In order for central banks to get some juicy assets, they go to their respective commercial banks and swap out commercial bank assets and in return give them reserve notes. From here, I'll just refer to central banks as the FED because I'm too retarded to think generically.

Here is a simple digram:

https://preview.redd.it/uqteb41adn181.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007fe17d3b9669a74fc50f6d4b54bb4d3ec6bf0f

And in balance sheet shenanigans:

Bank A: Has 90,000 dollars of U.S. treasuries

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|90,000 (S)|100,000 (D)|
|0 (L)||
|10,000 (R)||

Now the FED comes in and takes those 90,000 dollars of treasuries and gives Bank A 90,000 dollars of reserves.

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|0 (S)|100,000 (D)|
|0 (L)||
|100,000 (R)||

Here's the thing, the FED just increased the base reserves in the system, making it easier for banks to give out loans. Thus this is referred to as making credit cheaper. At the same time, Bank A, still gave the U.S. government 90,000 new dollars that will work its way back into the banking system as 90,000 dollars of deposits thus increasing the amount of reserves again, by 90,000 dollars!

In the meantime the FED balance sheet has become this

|Assets|Liabilities|
|:-|:-|
|90,000 (S)|90,000 (B)|
|0 (L)||
|0 (A) ||

Historically the FED has engaged in this mechanism through what is called the target Federal Funds Rate. There's quite a bit to this actually but the key takeway here is when the FED lowers the federal funds rate, one action they take is swapping short term securities from banks for reserves. When they raise the federal funds rate, they sell the securities back to the banks and take the reserves. Here is a chart of the Federal Funds Rate over time. (Note, these securities are so short in duration, the FED only has to wait 1 to 3 months for the US government to pay them back and thus, destroy the reserves)

https://preview.redd.it/lm03ez44fn181.png?width=2342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93ff9fbf1b200e4932df061915abe48d50835d2

As we can see, the federal funds rate has been mostly declining since the 1980s and every time we enter a credit contraction in the credit cycle, we massively cut the federal funds rate. This blunts the credit contraction by increasing bank reserves, lowering interest rates and resuming the increase in credit and debt. Low and behold the graph below.

https://preview.redd.it/p2lpq2iqin181.png?width=2376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3610eb6edafeb4dd3ad14dba66b3f97522ee16eb

This means, we keep kicking the can down the road and never letting the credit cycle complete. But remember, no one, and especially boomers wanted to go through a full contraction of the credit cycle. Today, it would be global suicided.

So, in 2008 (or if your Japan 2001), eventually the federal funds rate hits zero and it is time to get serious. Quantitative Easing (QE) is the next step. QE simply allows the central banks to swap what ever they want from a bank's balance sheet for reserves. For example, QE has allowed the FED to gobble up mortgage backed securities. The result is banks loan at lower interest rates in order to get home buyers to take out more/new loans. This result occurs because when a central bank engages in a swap with the bank, the bank loses an asset it was gonna make money on. Now the bank needs to create that asset again.

So QE helps keep the credit cycle going by increasing reserves, lowering interest rates and ultimately increasing the amount of credit/money in the system. Now for reasons in a different post, consumer price inflation has remained low despite this all this. However it has arguably caused massive asset inflation, contributing to an ever increase of wealth concentration.  

\---

To end it all, let's get back to the story of Doctor Big D and his clinic Big Ds for All. Let's imagine, instead of Doctor Big D having to kill himself and his life work going under, the FED in it's all mighty power comes in, engages in huge amount of QE, lowering interest rates for all! Big D is able to refinance, keep his business solvent and see his business recover as more zoomers come of age and get pp enlargement surgery. A happy ending for the day. Happy Thanksgiving.

but alas, Doctor Big D doesn't exist, my pp is small and I'm still a virgin.

[Wednesday Nov. 24 Aftermarket close for LGVN](https://preview.redd.it/hhm5v54vln181.png?width=3362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=228c241fa30a1beea5e5811385971e811c553fa1)

Hi, I hope you all had a great week in the market. It's not that often we get monster plays like **LGVN** to inflate our portfolios so when they come around we should take full advantage. What I mean by that is not only taking one run in each stock. **LGVN** for example was up and down for the whole week so you could have bought, sold, bought, sold and rinsed and repeated, etc...

The recent Trump stock that ran, **DWAC** was another good example of this type of opportunity and as you can see it hasn't done anything in a while.

Now on to the DD, **LGVN** made another similar run to $45 as it did the other day just before market close on Wednesday before settling in the aftermarket at about $30. As you can see from the picture above, it is a picture perfect **Cup and Handle** formation which is bullish, so look for good price action in the Premarket on Friday morning after Thanksgiving, and during the day as well. I don't always like holding volatile stocks through off-days but the image is undeniable, in my opinion.

Have a great holiday with friends and family and save me a turkey leg...

i dont know how this company actually makes money but i entered a position right away since i read it was on huge sale

it's trading at 0.3x book value, i just bought a logitech G305 this week because it was -40% on amazon so imagine my joy when i found out that i could get a stock that was -70% off

not even companies that just went bankrupt are trading for that cheap, Hertz is trading at 3x of book value

&amp;#x200B;

## why is it on sale?

so JXN listed a couple months ago as a demerger off prudential plc and a bunch of foreign shareholders sold it without caring what the price was because they didnt want to or couldnt trade on NYSE

because it doesnt even have a page on stocktwits yet, i was so excited to finally be smart money and enter an unknown stock before the other brainlets FOMO in

i did try to read into what they do but i couldnt understand any of it, they are a financials company so i think the basic idea is that they provide retirement funds to boomers while profiting a lot through advisor fees or something

the only thing i could understand is that theyre doing a lot of share buybacks and like 5% in dividend yields so i assume theyre making a lot of profit

also one of their insiders is named chad and he just bought $1.2 million in shares at $32 for him and his family

Well, I play both stocks and the digital stuff.

But Ive just been made aware that theres people buying virtual real estate for real life real estate value.

&amp;#x200B;

## what sale?

i dont know how this company actually makes money but i entered a position right away since i read it was on huge sale

it's trading at 0.3x book value, i just bought a logitech G305 this week because it was -40% on amazon so imagine my joy when i found out that i could get a stock that was -70% off

not even companies that just went bankrupt are trading for that cheap, Hertz is trading at 3x of book value

&amp;#x200B;

## why is it on sale?

so JXN listed a couple months ago as a demerger off PUK and a bunch of foreign shareholders apparently sold it without caring what the price was because they didnt want to or couldnt trade on NYSE

because it doesnt even have a page on stocktwits yet, i was so excited to finally be smart money and enter an unknown stock before the other brainlets FOMO in

&amp;#x200B;

## are they a good company?

i did try to read into what JXN does but i couldnt understand any of it, they are a financials company so i think the basic idea is that they provide retirement funds to boomers while profiting a lot through advisor fees or something

BlackBerry is set to have a parabolic run over the next few weeks/months with many upcoming catalyst! Below is my analysis of why I think the stock is going higher.

**Background - The turn around story of the SLEEPING GIANT**

Under the leadership of CEO John Chen, BlackBerry has spent the past 8 years pivoting from hardware smartphones to the future: (1) IoT Internet of Things (2) Automotive/EV and (3) Cyber Security. 

All three of these areas are growth opportunities and BlackBerry has strategically partnered with many large tech companies including: Amazon, Microsoft and Qualcomm. 

The market value of Blackberry is criminally undervalued at \~$7 Billion compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $53 Billion, $PANW at $54 Billion and $ZS at 48 $Billion to name a few.

The transformation of the business can be summarized in the slide below. Mickensy Consulting has estimated that the pool of reoccurring revenue from the IoT and connected car will grow exponentially over the next 10 years, which is good for BlackBerry's new business model.

**Patent Sale Announcement** 

There is been lots of speculation and rumors over the past few month from various sources, ranging from Facebook $FB being the sole purchaser for cash up from and/or a partnership deal, to a group of parties. The range of the deal is said to be worth $1 Billion to $2 Billion. 

On the last conference call, CEO John Chen said that there is about an ""80% probability that the deal closes by Q4"". This date is November 2021, which is next week. However, they could also be waiting to release it during their next earnings call on December 21st, 2021.

**QNX, Amazon IVY and the I****oT and the connected car ecosystem**

QNX real-time OS is installed in 195M cars today, out of 1.4B cars in total on the road worldwide. QNX enables many different software pieces to run in a car, so acts as a kind of central control unit. QNX is becoming the predominant OS for connected cars, since its installed in so many cars. Whilst today $BB licenses QNX to OEMs on a per-unit royalty basis, QNX is effectively set up (through Blackberry Ivy, in partnership with $AMZN) to be the foundation of the data value chain for the auto industry, which McKinsey estimates will be quite big, specially for a company ($BB) with a market cap of 5B$ today. I think this will extend to other verticals over the next decade.

**CES 2022 BB will be demonstrating both cyber and IoT with key partners**

BlackBerry has started testing their BETA version of IVY with Amazon this fall and are looking to showcase more features and capabilities with key partners at the CES in early 2022.

**Institutions are loading up.** 

Over the past months, big institutions have been increasing their position. Today for example, Morgan Stanley's 13F filing showed that they alone increased their $BB holdings by +51%!

**Technical Analysis** 

The weekly chart is a tight equilibrium pattern looking to break out on the bullish catalyst. Price target $30 by early next year.

It'd be actively managed by the finest wallstreetbets degens and we could vote on what to add and add the most updooted DDs. We could easily beat SPYs yearly returns and accelerate returns just by allocating a large portion of the funds into SPY FDs as well. Literally beating the S&amp;P by riding on its tail coats, it's genius. We'll be even bigger than SPY! According to Investopedia all we need to come up with 100k, which shouldn't be problem considering all the gain porn we've seen in the sub this year. Imagine the possibilities.

Jimmy was wrong.

Jimmy was mad. Jimmy got rejected by his high school crush to a guy named Chad. Chad was the son of a local retard who hit big on GME. To Jimmy he had no idea what GME meant nor WSB. 

Later in the evening, Jimmy went on his computer and typed in wallstreetbets in google. What felt like a rabbit hole.....Jimmy could feel his brain cells being destroyed. He had a slight drool coming down his face as he read the shit posts and all the massive gains.

Jimmy was motivated.....he wants to win back Veronica like the true nice guy he was, by winning big in the market. By having money set aside for college from his grandma's inheritance, Jimmy decided to deposit all of his grandma's money into his investment account. He quickly picked a random ass stock from WSB and proceeded to buy far OTM calls that expired at close.

His reasoning behind this trade was that people shared that the stock ""can't go tits up"" and the contracts seemed ""cheap"". Jimmy watched the chart go the opposite direction near market close and his contracts plummet to zero.

Jimmy yelled out a ""FUCK, I WANTED TO FUCK VERONICA""

His dad slammed open the door with a giant fucking dragon dildo and said ""You WANT TO GET FUCKED?""

We all know metaverse craze is massive I bought mana at 2.5 (want to be honest don't want to make up stories) and Sand at 2.3. I have tripled my money with sand and doubled my money with Mana. I took all my money to stocks that too OTC, yeah you heard right OTC. You would have thought that I am the dumbest person in the world but I am pretty sure you will definitely change your mind after reading it completely.

When pokemon go introduced a stock known as NTDOY pumped from 17 to 70+ but why ? That ticker belongs to Nintendo which has trademark rights of pokemon. Since it's developer Niantic doesn't publicly traded, it's a wiser move to own the stock that's own Pokemon.

Most of us would have collected Pokemon cards and some rare cards are worth millions just imagine the worth of NFTs of Charizard. We all know how cool the pokemon world would be and I leave rest to your imaginations.

Here's my current plan:  


* Invest $200/week at an 80/20 split between long term reliable stocks and higher-risk options trades
* Until I start working, use my $500 to start my options trades
* Buy calls and puts in pairs on stocks with $1-2 monthly volatility, in hopes of cashing a profit on both at different times of the month when they're profitable
* Do this in $500 batches, so starting with one option at the time and then using two when it doubles, etc
* After I hit a sufficient amount of diversification, start raising the amount of money in each batch
* I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my risk tolerance

**Fundamental Analysis Discussion:**

*Improvements in the business model since 2017 have culminated in transformative profits for the company.* Now, DKS is a pandemic sugar baby, people have turned out to play sports in record numbers in the last 2 years. These new athletes need new equipment, and DKS is happy to provide. **Operating margin has gone from 5% to 20%** in the last year, as a result of a stricter promotional policy. **Online sales are up 100%** from this point in 2019.

Dicks recently entered a **new strategic partnership with Nike** to provide new value through exclusive products, experiences, content, and other specialized offers. 

*Dicks opened 2 new house of sport stores in Rochester and Knoxville that focus on the athlete experience. The house of sport does this by becoming a pseudo gym, integrating climbing walls, putting greens, batting cages, etc. They're really fucking cool. Dicks opened 2 new Golf Galaxy centers in Boston and Minneapolis to capitalize on the explosive re-popularization of Golf. Dicks opened 2 new Dick's public lands stores in Pittsburg and Columbus to capitalize on the incredible demand the pandemic has created to experience public land and national parks.*

That's a total of **6 new stores this year**, up from 728 in 2020. 

**Dicks has ordered aggressively to circumvent pandemic shortages** from their suppliers to ensure the company can get ahead of the robust demand. Quarter ending inventory increased 7.3% compared to last year. In other words **Dicks is ready to serve holiday shoppers, regardless of whether factory workers in Vietnam are quarantined or not.** 

**Quarter 4 is about to give Dicks a raging erection.**

Technical Analysis:

[DKS 2021 Bull Run](https://preview.redd.it/0xwdz0o5fl181.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ef71ac3e0bec99c42ba6cfc0fe03dfe68efd8de)

As you can see, DKS has been printing big green dildos for all of 2021, and has established a consistent pattern of rising support levels. 

[DKS Sept 23 Dip](https://preview.redd.it/ralo8lhegl181.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27589b2542bd16f2aa949c4e13196991aa0b44b9)

As mentioned previously, DKS got castrated at earnings, had a rally at the end of the day, and dropped again this morning. Resistance formed around 143.5$, before dropping back to a higher level of support around 127$. Watch for a breakout around 129.5$, and a rally beyond 134$.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:**

Shares, Call (Singular, I'm a college student).

https://preview.redd.it/au3l42h6kl181.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ae70bddce70d6d1b3351c8b4174c7cd06d594b

2 Shares (long term hold). 

1 1000$ call @ a strike price of 125$, 29 DTE.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

***I'm horny for DKS.***

**DKS got castrated despite 55% earnings beat. DKS is a bargain at current prices, and trading near historic support. DKS expanded to magnum dong levels in 2021 due to the pandemic and its long term effects on sporting goods demand. DKS is ahead of the game and prepared for robust holiday sales with an aggressively large inventory.** 

***Also, DKS could become a meme stock not even gay bears can resist.***

Last up is Innoviz, another tech stock  but this one has a much more hands-on approach. Innoviz is a producer of LiDAR systems for the automotive market. These advanced sensor systems (LiDAR stands for light detection and ranging) were originally developed for cartographic applications, allowing aircraft and satellites to create highly accurate topographic maps  but they have been adapted by automobile manufacturers as the eyes of the cars, and are now a vital technology in the autonomous vehicle niche.

As for Cathie Wood, she was impressed enough by Innoviz to buy up 352,816 shares in the company in Q3. This stake has a current value of $2.36 million.

Wood isnt the only INVZ fan. Covering the stock for investment banking firm Cantor, analyst [Andres Sheppard](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/andres-sheppard) takes up coverage of this stock with a bullish attitude.

1,"11/25/2021, 00:16:10",$WISH - buy rumor (short) sell fact (cover),Spiritual-Prize-4491,"Going on a limb and calling this a  bottom for $WISH. 

Now can the stock go down, maybe idk but if I knew I would certainly not be posting on WSB sub reddit, but here is my logic as to why this is the bottom.

I will make this quick b/c WSB users have an attention span of a goddamn goldfish, and that would still be a complement.

&amp;#x200B;

1. WISH is a turnaround story which is highly susceptible to perception manipulation
2. What we saw with French ban is utter pollical posturing - at best, and at worse manipulation. To settle this I would want to see the double blind test the French used across all suppliers to determine to pull WISH from the search engines. 
   1. For the smooth brain apes I will break this down further.
      1. French citizens can still use WISH they just cant google for it. That's it. 
      2. This decision is now challenged in court and good chance it will be reverted. Okay IDK if there is any chance it will be reverted but it smells like bullshit. I just know the same people banned RedBull 

But to me the ban raises more questions than answers. Why only the search engine ban? Why WISH? Why now? Don't the French have enough short stocks to go after? Well actually it turns out short  selling was banned for a time in France. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/france-italy-spain-ban-short-selling-to-curb-market-plunge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/france-italy-spain-ban-short-selling-to-curb-market-plunge) This ban was lifted but I am certain the message was sent for short sellers to go else where.

 But I digress, back to WISH.

I will go out on a limb and call a bottom for WISH. With one caveat, if the folks who shorted get greedy, you may expect more FUD to come. If this was an inside job, and they knew about the French ban prior to opening the position they must be well connected. because this is a great move purely from making money point of view. 

I fully expect the market to see through it as I did.

WISH revamped its QA, and have an excellent customer service ( I know first hand that they will refund in US any item like Amazon did in the early days) 

Planning to keep adding to my position every chance I get.

PS: I was angry when I wrote this, so excuse the sharp tone. I have great respect for the role in history the French played and also I love French Fries, so I hope me and the French are still cool. I only have beef with the legislators of the ban",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r18rk7/wish_buy_rumor_short_sell_fact_cover/
1,"11/25/2021, 00:14:40",BYSI,Axu-mite,Im currently looking and researching on BYSI which has an FDA approval on Nov 30th. I wanted to know what everyone thinks of this. It looks to be promising according to my research but needed a little bit more. I personally think it is looking good and soon will be going up a lot and it is already making an upward movement. Lets get some real analysis and opinion in the comments. Are we gonna go to the moon? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r18qdz/bysi/
1,"11/25/2021, 00:13:58",Institutions dont want you to know about these companies,park9720,"Theres an industry in the US that is currently booming, seeing record revenue growth YoY with massive  growth predicted in the near term and future. That industry is US Cannabis. When I say US Cannabis Im talking about Trulieve, Cresco Labs, Curaleaf and Green Thumb. Most of you dumb fucks comment TILRAY and SUNDIAL on every post pertaining to US Cannabis but have absolutely no idea that there are currently massive cannabis companies already dominating the US markets; these companies are undervalued, operate in a market that is CURRENTLY 3x LARGER than the Canadian market and major institutions are sitting on the sidelines.

Since US Cannabis companies are not allowed to trade on major exchanges like the Nasdaq and the NYSE and technically run federally illegal businesses, most institutional investors will not touch them. In fact, retail investors currently account for about 95% of these companies free float. Once Legalization takes place or the Safe Banking Act (Might get passed through the [NDAA](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bipartisan-senators-urge-passage-of-marijuana-banking-through-defense-bill/)) goes through and these companies can uplist from the OTC and CSE, institutions will be loading up on these American based Cannabis behemoths- but until then retail investors have a significant opportunity.

I know 75% of you had your assholes clenched since the second you read the word cannabis, but there is a significant difference between the Canadian Cannabis companies (Licensed Producer's) youre currently holding the bag on, and US cannabis companies (Multi State Operators). Im going to quickly compare the numbers and  show you why youre buying in low on the US based cannabis companies.

 

US Market Currently has 18 Recreational States and 36 Medical States- Total Population 110M

Recreational States coming in 2022- [New York](https://www.nytimes.com/article/new-york-marijuana-legalization-facts.html), [Ohio](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/republican-ohio-lawmaker-announces-marijuana-legalization-bill-reflecting-recent-bipartisan-shift-on-issue/) &amp; [Pennsylvania](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/philadelphia-voters-approve-marijuana-referendum-calling-for-statewide-legalization/)\- Total Pop 44M

Canadian Market; Entire Country is recreational- Total Pop 37.5M

As it stands right now the US market is 3x larger than the Canadian market, when the 3 states listed above go online it will be 4x larger. A lot of you probably had no idea the legal market was so big in the US, and if youre wondering if it directly correlates to higher sales- youd be correct.

&amp;#x200B;

[Numbers based on most recent Quarter](https://preview.redd.it/78kxhuudhk181.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a78f127118b99c0f2ba78552544f515ad83b5ef4)

 Not only do the US based companies have significantly better Revenues and EBITDA, Trulieve and Green Thumb are profitable (40M &amp; 22M), with Curaleaf (-7M) and Cresco (-4M) on the cusp of profitability.

US Cannabis companies are clearly better built and operate in a market that is literally 4x larger than their Canadian peers but for some reason trade at half the multiple of the Canadian companies. There is no media hype around these companies, they are some of the heaviest [shorted](https://shortdata.ca/largest-short-positions) companies on the CSE, Morgan Stanley even recently [banned](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-jpmorgan-restrict-trading-us-cannabis-stocks-letter-2021-11-02/)  the buying of US cannabis companies. These companies are hidden gems that institutions dont want you to know about so they can get in on the  low, but it is an incredible opportunity for retail investors.

[Valuation Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/s2v04jbiik181.jpg?width=1020&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bfe88793acb9a50faf7b579340a7130e5927fb3)

During the cannabis bull run Canadian companies were valued as high as 36-427x their current revenues. None of the US companies Ive listed  are currently valued above 6x revenue.

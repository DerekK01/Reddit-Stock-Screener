So first, we are going to look at the past three days of trading. The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.

**Why did MU pop on Friday:**

**Micron opened at 78.93, had a high of 83.86, a low of 78.93, closed at 83.03 (7.80% change), and 47.22M volume.**

[Covered in the first DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/) *Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).*

(
*In his note, Muse wrote that while shares of chip makers like Micron have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor index, or SOX, since early June, the tide may be shifting.*

*We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021, Muse wrote.*

[Useful Nasdaq article explaining Fridays hype ""Why Is Everyone Talking About Micron Stock?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-everyone-talking-about-micron-stock)

This is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).

**Why did MU pop on Monday:**

**Micron opened at 83.66, had a high of 87.67, a low of 83.66, closed at 83.86 (1.00% change) and 34.35M volume.**

MU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Mondays rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.

**An important thing to note is that despite the market slide on Monday, Micron generally held its own and remained green.** The rest of my calls were obliterated, meanwhile the calls I bought pre-market and 5 minutes after open remained in profit. I did not sell these on the peak, I am still holding them. 


*Evercore ISI analyst upgrade from Friday:* 
Again due to the Evercore ISI price upgrade on Friday, MU saw strong momentum on Monday.

*Citi analyst upgrade from Friday:*
*Citi analyst Christopher Danely said the pricing correction in the DRAM market was ""drawing to a close"" as the PC and server markets stabilized and expanded. As such, he expects Micron to benefit from ""more positive catalysts"" in the coming months and maintains a ""buy"" rating with a price target of $120 -- more than 40% above its current price.*

*CNBC article released pre-market:*
[An article was released on Monday from CNBC, 7:00AM EST.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html)  This highlighted the two analyst upgrades, their targets, and the upside. Due to CNBCs wide reach, this highlighted the stock to other investors and drove momentum. 

One bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC Trading Nation: On CNBCs ""Trading Nation,"" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.
However my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.

*Microns LPDDR5X DRAM is going to be used in the MediaTek Dimensity 9000:*

**This is important news, Im going to cover this later in my DD.** This was also announced pre-market. 
*[Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) revealed that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) DRAM for MediaTek Inc.s new Dimensity 9000 5G flagship chipset for smartphones has been validated.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)*
 
*Built on its 1 (1-alpha) node, the new chipset will help smartphones unlock applications powered by artificial intelligence and 5G innovation. Micron claims LPDDR5X to be the fastest and most advanced mobile memory available. It says that it has shipped the first batch of samples.*
 
*Meanwhile, Micron disclosed that it was joining hands with leading smartphone manufacturers and chipset vendors to enable ecosystem innovation with LPDDR5X.*
[*Micron outperformed the general market on Monday*](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-technology-inc-stock-rises-monday-outperforms-market-01637619013)

[*Nasdaq recommended Micron as one of top 4 stock trades for Monday*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-monday%3A-lcid-hood-mu-fl-2021-11-19)

[**Furthermore MU was the 3nd (2nd according to other scrapers) most discussed stock on Wallstreetbets Monday**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24215526/gamestop-top-discussed-stock-on-wallstreetbets-heading-into-new-week-micron-tesla-and-th)

**Why did MU pop again on Tuesday:**

**Micron opened at 85.04, had a high of 87.71, a low of 84.33, closed at 85.41 (1.85% change), and had a volume of 31.64M**

Micron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. 

The primary reason for this was that [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/) upgraded Micron back to a buy (one month after it was downgraded). 

[Link to Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539?mod=mw_latestnews)

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.

*When Rakesh downgraded Micron last month, he cited expectations of a soft demand outlook for the first half of 2022 for PCs and notebooks, server and handset markets.*

*However, our recent checks indicate the ACTUAL demand is improving across all three markets, Rakesh wrote in a research note, with first-quarter PC/NB builds only flat to down 5% from the previous quarter, compared with expectations of a 10% to 15% decline and handsets flat versus expectations of down 10%. He also believes server demand could improve.*


[From Barrons:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537)
New data indicated actual demand was improving across PCs, servers and handsets that could support an improved pricing, prompting [Rakesh to raise the stock to Buy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537) and boost his price targets. The new target for Micron is $95, up from $75

*Rakesh estimates that first-quarter PC and netbook builds will only decrease between 0% and 5% quarter over quarter, up from previous estimates that they would fall between 10% and 15%. PC demand alone could be up as much as 5% year over year, a shift Rakesh said was surprising given Wall Street consensus that demand would be down between 2% and 3%.*

*Requests for memory chips in China also could improve compared to previous estimates, as well as orders from server hosts like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google (GOOGL). An additional boost could come from upcoming investments in the metaverse and virtual reality.*

*Micron may be a new darling among analysts. Last week, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse added Micron to his list of top stock picks, anticipating a return to earnings growth next year.*

[**Micron was once again one of the top discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets on Tuesday, being in the fourth position.**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24243247/gamestop-remains-top-wallstreetbets-interest-zoom-video-micron-technology-and-these-are-)

**Wednesday outlook:**

MU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today.

Update: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M). Current price (10:27AM EST) is 86.15 representing a  0.85% change. 

*Wednesdays news/articles:*
12:36AM EST: [Micron Rallies Against The Grain (Investing.com)](https://www.investing.com/analysis/micron-rallies-against-the-grain-200609364)

Approx 8:40AM EST [:Micron Technology Stock Is at the Middle of an Upswing, Not the End](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

An analysis of the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 news [(Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000):

[Micron is the first semiconductor company to sample and validate this fastest, most advanced mobile memory](https://www.mediatek.com/blog/mediatek-and-micron-validate-lpddr5x-for-dimensity-9000) in the industry and has shipped the first batch of samples of LPDDR5X built on its [first-to-market 1 (1-alpha) node.](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-industrys-first-1a-dram-technology)

*This 1 node achievement confirms Microns excellence in DRAM and is a direct result of Microns relentless commitment to cutting-edge design and technology, said Scott DeBoer, executive vice president of technology and products at Micron. With a 40% improvement in memory density over our previous 1z DRAM node, this advancement will create a solid foundation for future product and memory innovation.*

*Our new 1 DRAM technology will enable the industrys lowest-power mobile DRAM as well as bring the benefits of our DRAM portfolio to data center, client, consumer, industrial and automotive customers, said Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief business officer at Micron. With our industry leadership in both DRAM and NAND technology, Micron is in an excellent position to leverage the growth in memory and storage, which are expected to be the fastest growing segments in the semiconductor industry over the next decade.*

It is noteworthy that Samsung was the first to announce LPDDR5X DRAM, however Micron was the first to validate its LDPDDR5X module DRAM in partnership with MediaTek. **Micron has already shipped the first batch of this DRAM module.**  This is not surprising as Micron has been making GDDR5X and GDDR6X VRAM for Nvidia GPUs for many years. 

Micron has also revealed that samples of this new memory module for smartphones supports data rates of up to 8.533 Gbps, making it 30% faster than LPDDR5 modules (it is worth noting these are the highest achievable figures for the standard, and not real world figures). 

**How is LPDDR5X RAM on the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 better than LPDDR5?**

[Relevant chart of the Micron LPDDR5X used by MediaTek](https://imgur.com/yKsnPyo)

This RAM is the newest standard in RAM technology for mobile devices. It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.

[**When sampled**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/lpddr5x-ram-vs-lpddr5-dram-dimensity-9000/) Microns LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speeds (or that it is maybe saving them for other manufacturers than MediaTek). LPDDR5 (highest rate) achieves 6400Mbps. 

*Based on these results, MediaTek concluded that LPDDR5X modules lead to 17% faster transfer speeds and 15% lower latency compared to the previous generation.*

*MediaTek remarked the new RAM technology will allow increasingly higher levels of data processing, which are needed for the complex and heterogeneous processing units that are built into modern-day chipsets. These higher processing capabilities will be vital for the high-data requirements of the 5G era.*

**The difference between Microns and Samsungs LPDDR5X solutions can only be compared once the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks are released, or newer chips featuring the most recent RAM technology.**

*Availability of Microns new DRAM:*
*Microns Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1 node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.*

**P/E Ratio:**

MUs current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. Im sourcing from the below linked article for this section. 

*[Recent times have been advantageous for Micron Technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb) as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.*

*Micron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.*

Last year delivered a 117% gain to the companys bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.

*Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 35% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.*

Microns P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. Its superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. 

The risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility. 

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q3 2021:**

[Recent relevant article released today, I will be sourcing from this for this section.](https://evertiq.com/design/51010)

Hyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. 

Major smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models. 

*As such, clients in both server and smartphone industries made significant contributions to the revenue growth of the NAND Flash industry for 3Q21.* 

However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEMs are showing signs of decline. 

On the whole, the industrys quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.*

*Demand from the data center segment remained strong, and clients continued to adopt Microns 176L products. However, Microns shipment share in the smartphone market lagged behind that of other NAND Flash suppliers. Furthermore, its PC OEM clients were starting to be affected by the uneven supply of semiconductor chips. In light of these factors, Microns NAND Flash bit shipment increased by a modest 4% QoQ. On the other hand, the NAND Flash market remained in a severe shortage in 3Q21, thereby driving up Microns ASP by about 5% QoQ. Hence, Microns NAND Flash revenue for 3Q21 reached USD 1.97 billion, an 8.8% QoQ increase.*

[*Sales ranking of Branded NAND Flash makers, Q3 2021 (in million USD)*](https://imgur.com/sbJyTmY)

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q4 2021:**

The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. 
Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. 

*For OEMs and ODMs, the differences between the NAND Flash inventory level and the inventory levels of other components have been growing over the past several months. Therefore, they have to scale back orders and reduce stock for NAND Flash. As inventory adjustments are happening, NAND Flash contract prices will start to drop and thus bring about an end to the several quarters of strong revenue growth enjoyed by suppliers.*

I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Microns business though. 

**Microns CEO, an analysis of his performance**

[Memory chip demand has been exploding since Sanjay Mehrotra was recruited as Micron CEO in 2017.](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

Mehrotra previously founded SanDisk. He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.

[After Mehrotra joined Micron as CEO, strong performance was seen in 2017 and 2018.](https://investorplace.com/2018/05/micron-technology-inc-booming-despite-low-stock-price/). Microns sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time. Long term debt fell to $7.8 billion nd could be paid out of cash on hand. Its price to earnings ratio was 10 (as of May 2018), which would mean a 25% bump in stock price. 

*In March 2020* [Micron surprised analysts by earning $405 million, 36 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter ending in February.](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/micron-mu-stock-offers-hope-in-turbulent-market/) Certainly strong performance despite being at the start of the pandemic.

*The results sent MU stock up over 5% on March 26, although shares are down over 3% in mid-morning trading March 27.*

Shares rose sharply thanks to a [conservative outlook from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-earnings-conservative-outlook-seen-as-prudent-but-rest-of-year-remains-a-big-question-2020-03-23), who has seen many booms and busts in his 30 years as a memory company executive.

*Last week, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a letter that the company took early precautions in January to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in its facilities in China and the rest of Asia and expanded those protections as the virus spread world-wide.*

*We have also carefully managed raw materials and our supply chain to maintain our manufacturing capabilities and production, Mehrotra said. Our global team has shown tremendous strength and solidarity, operating with excellence despite lockdowns and quarantines that challenged staffing, shipments and work schedules.*

Because memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a supercycle, with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.

*Analysis as of today 24th of November 2021:*
Memory has been going through a super-cycle for years now, this is due to SSDs/flash memory replacing standard HDDs in consumer devices and more recently in data centres. SSDs/flash memory are faster and more reliable. As the price has been coming down for SSDs/flash memory, the switch to these has accelerated. 

Analysts may warn that this super-cycle is peaking, however it is just [cooling down](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107140009). And as outlined in my previous DD, in 2023, 2024 and the future. We can actually expect memory demand to exponentially increase. 

[Chart showing price projections of various DRAM product categories for Q3](https://imgur.com/bPkMum5)

The current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (The super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&amp;no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/). As well as cloud-computing. 

Mehrotra sees it continuing. As outlined in my previous DD, he has set a capital budget of [$150 billion for the next decade.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-plans-over-150-billion-in-capital-r-d-spending-in-decade-ahead-11634724001). Please see my last DD or the link for more info on this budget.

**TL;DR:**

* Fridays performance was strong due to Evercore ISI Analyst upgrades, as well as a Citi upgrade.

* Mondays performance was due to the Evercore ISI and Citi analyst upgrades, as well as other factors including; CNBC article, LPDDR5X DRAM announcement, and other articles released/general hype. It was one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

* Tuesdays performance was due to Mizuho analyst upgrade. It was also one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

* Microns LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speed.

**TL;DR of the TL;DR:**
Analyst upgrades, hype and new RAM technology have contributed to the price rise this week. NAND flash shipments are rising Q3. There is a supply shortage across the market. The memory supercycle is expected to continue until 2023 and perhaps beyond.

[Part one link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/)

So first, we are going to look at the past three days of trading. The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.

**Why did MU pop on Friday:**

**Micron opened at 78.93, had a high of 83.86, a low of 78.93, closed at 83.03 (7.80% change), and 47.22M volume.**

[Covered in the first DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/) *Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).*

(
*In his note, Muse wrote that while shares of chip makers like Micron have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor index, or SOX, since early June, the tide may be shifting.*

*We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021, Muse wrote.*

[Useful Nasdaq article explaining Fridays hype ""Why Is Everyone Talking About Micron Stock?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-everyone-talking-about-micron-stock)

This is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).

**Why did MU pop on Monday:**

**Micron opened at 83.66, had a high of 87.67, a low of 83.66, closed at 83.86 (1.00% change) and 34.35M volume.**

MU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Mondays rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.

**An important thing to note is that despite the market slide on Monday, Micron generally held its own and remained green.** The rest of my calls were obliterated, meanwhile the calls I bought pre-market and 5 minutes after open remained in profit. I did not sell these on the peak, I am still holding them. 


*Evercore ISI analyst upgrade from Friday:* 
Again due to the Evercore ISI price upgrade on Friday, MU saw strong momentum on Monday.

*Citi analyst upgrade from Friday:*
*Citi analyst Christopher Danely said the pricing correction in the DRAM market was ""drawing to a close"" as the PC and server markets stabilized and expanded. As such, he expects Micron to benefit from ""more positive catalysts"" in the coming months and maintains a ""buy"" rating with a price target of $120 -- more than 40% above its current price.*

*CNBC article released pre-market:*
[An article was released on Monday from CNBC, 7:00AM EST.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html)  This highlighted the two analyst upgrades, their targets, and the upside. Due to CNBCs wide reach, this highlighted the stock to other investors and drove momentum. 

One bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC Trading Nation: On CNBCs ""Trading Nation,"" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.
However my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.

*Microns LPDDR5X DRAM is going to be used in the MediaTek Dimensity 9000:*

**This is important news, Im going to cover this later in my DD.** This was also announced pre-market. 
*[Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) revealed that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) DRAM for MediaTek Inc.s new Dimensity 9000 5G flagship chipset for smartphones has been validated.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)*
 
*Built on its 1 (1-alpha) node, the new chipset will help smartphones unlock applications powered by artificial intelligence and 5G innovation. Micron claims LPDDR5X to be the fastest and most advanced mobile memory available. It says that it has shipped the first batch of samples.*
 
*Meanwhile, Micron disclosed that it was joining hands with leading smartphone manufacturers and chipset vendors to enable ecosystem innovation with LPDDR5X.*
[*Micron outperformed the general market on Monday*](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-technology-inc-stock-rises-monday-outperforms-market-01637619013)

[*Nasdaq recommended Micron as one of top 4 stock trades for Monday*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-monday%3A-lcid-hood-mu-fl-2021-11-19)

[**Furthermore MU was the 3nd (2nd according to other scrapers) most discussed stock on Wallstreetbets Monday**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24215526/gamestop-top-discussed-stock-on-wallstreetbets-heading-into-new-week-micron-tesla-and-th)

**Why did MU pop again on Tuesday:**

**Micron opened at 85.04, had a high of 87.71, a low of 84.33, closed at 85.41 (1.85% change), and had a volume of 31.64M**

Micron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. 

The primary reason for this was that [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/) upgraded Micron back to a buy (one month after it was downgraded). 

[Link to Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539?mod=mw_latestnews)

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.

*When Rakesh downgraded Micron last month, he cited expectations of a soft demand outlook for the first half of 2022 for PCs and notebooks, server and handset markets.*

*However, our recent checks indicate the ACTUAL demand is improving across all three markets, Rakesh wrote in a research note, with first-quarter PC/NB builds only flat to down 5% from the previous quarter, compared with expectations of a 10% to 15% decline and handsets flat versus expectations of down 10%. He also believes server demand could improve.*


[From Barrons:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537)
New data indicated actual demand was improving across PCs, servers and handsets that could support an improved pricing, prompting [Rakesh to raise the stock to Buy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537) and boost his price targets. The new target for Micron is $95, up from $75

*Rakesh estimates that first-quarter PC and netbook builds will only decrease between 0% and 5% quarter over quarter, up from previous estimates that they would fall between 10% and 15%. PC demand alone could be up as much as 5% year over year, a shift Rakesh said was surprising given Wall Street consensus that demand would be down between 2% and 3%.*

*Requests for memory chips in China also could improve compared to previous estimates, as well as orders from server hosts like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google (GOOGL). An additional boost could come from upcoming investments in the metaverse and virtual reality.*

*Micron may be a new darling among analysts. Last week, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse added Micron to his list of top stock picks, anticipating a return to earnings growth next year.*

[**Micron was once again one of the top discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets on Tuesday, being in the fourth position.**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24243247/gamestop-remains-top-wallstreetbets-interest-zoom-video-micron-technology-and-these-are-)

**Wednesday outlook:**

MU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today.

Update: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M). Current price (10:27AM EST) is 86.15 representing a  0.85% change. 

*Wednesdays news/articles:*
12:36AM EST: [Micron Rallies Against The Grain (Investing.com)](https://www.investing.com/analysis/micron-rallies-against-the-grain-200609364)

Approx 8:40AM EST [:Micron Technology Stock Is at the Middle of an Upswing, Not the End](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

An analysis of the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 news [(Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000):

[Micron is the first semiconductor company to sample and validate this fastest, most advanced mobile memory](https://www.mediatek.com/blog/mediatek-and-micron-validate-lpddr5x-for-dimensity-9000) in the industry and has shipped the first batch of samples of LPDDR5X built on its [first-to-market 1 (1-alpha) node.](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-industrys-first-1a-dram-technology)

*This 1 node achievement confirms Microns excellence in DRAM and is a direct result of Microns relentless commitment to cutting-edge design and technology, said Scott DeBoer, executive vice president of technology and products at Micron. With a 40% improvement in memory density over our previous 1z DRAM node, this advancement will create a solid foundation for future product and memory innovation.*

*Our new 1 DRAM technology will enable the industrys lowest-power mobile DRAM as well as bring the benefits of our DRAM portfolio to data center, client, consumer, industrial and automotive customers, said Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief business officer at Micron. With our industry leadership in both DRAM and NAND technology, Micron is in an excellent position to leverage the growth in memory and storage, which are expected to be the fastest growing segments in the semiconductor industry over the next decade.*

It is noteworthy that Samsung was the first to announce LPDDR5X DRAM, however Micron was the first to validate its LDPDDR5X module DRAM in partnership with MediaTek. **Micron has already shipped the first batch of this DRAM module.**  This is not surprising as Micron has been making GDDR5X and GDDR6X VRAM for Nvidia GPUs for many years. 

Micron has also revealed that samples of this new memory module for smartphones supports data rates of up to 8.533 Gbps, making it 30% faster than LPDDR5 modules (it is worth noting these are the highest achievable figures for the standard, and not real world figures). 

**How is LPDDR5X RAM on the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 better than LPDDR5?**

[Relevant chart of the Micron LPDDR5X used by MediaTek](https://imgur.com/yKsnPyo)

This RAM is the newest standard in RAM technology for mobile devices. It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.

[**When sampled**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/lpddr5x-ram-vs-lpddr5-dram-dimensity-9000/) Microns LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speeds (or that it is maybe saving them for other manufacturers than MediaTek). LPDDR5 (highest rate) achieves 6400Mbps. 

*Based on these results, MediaTek concluded that LPDDR5X modules lead to 17% faster transfer speeds and 15% lower latency compared to the previous generation.*

*MediaTek remarked the new RAM technology will allow increasingly higher levels of data processing, which are needed for the complex and heterogeneous processing units that are built into modern-day chipsets. These higher processing capabilities will be vital for the high-data requirements of the 5G era.*

**The difference between Microns and Samsungs LPDDR5X solutions can only be compared once the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks are released, or newer chips featuring the most recent RAM technology.**

*Availability of Microns new DRAM:*
*Microns Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1 node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.*

**P/E Ratio:**

MUs current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. Im sourcing from the below linked article for this section. 

*[Recent times have been advantageous for Micron Technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb) as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.*

*Micron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.*

Last year delivered a 117% gain to the companys bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.

*Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 35% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.*

Microns P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. Its superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. 

The risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility. 

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q3 2021:**

[Recent relevant article released today, I will be sourcing from this for this section.](https://evertiq.com/design/51010)

Hyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. 

Major smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models. 

*As such, clients in both server and smartphone industries made significant contributions to the revenue growth of the NAND Flash industry for 3Q21.* 

However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEMs are showing signs of decline. 

On the whole, the industrys quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.*

*Demand from the data center segment remained strong, and clients continued to adopt Microns 176L products. However, Microns shipment share in the smartphone market lagged behind that of other NAND Flash suppliers. Furthermore, its PC OEM clients were starting to be affected by the uneven supply of semiconductor chips. In light of these factors, Microns NAND Flash bit shipment increased by a modest 4% QoQ. On the other hand, the NAND Flash market remained in a severe shortage in 3Q21, thereby driving up Microns ASP by about 5% QoQ. Hence, Microns NAND Flash revenue for 3Q21 reached USD 1.97 billion, an 8.8% QoQ increase.*

[*Sales ranking of Branded NAND Flash makers, Q3 2021 (in million USD)*](https://imgur.com/sbJyTmY)

**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q4 2021:**

The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. 
Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. 

*For OEMs and ODMs, the differences between the NAND Flash inventory level and the inventory levels of other components have been growing over the past several months. Therefore, they have to scale back orders and reduce stock for NAND Flash. As inventory adjustments are happening, NAND Flash contract prices will start to drop and thus bring about an end to the several quarters of strong revenue growth enjoyed by suppliers.*

I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Microns business though. 

**Microns CEO, an analysis of his performance**

[Memory chip demand has been exploding since Sanjay Mehrotra was recruited as Micron CEO in 2017.](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)

Mehrotra previously founded SanDisk. He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.

[After Mehrotra joined Micron as CEO, strong performance was seen in 2017 and 2018.](https://investorplace.com/2018/05/micron-technology-inc-booming-despite-low-stock-price/). Microns sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time. Long term debt fell to $7.8 billion nd could be paid out of cash on hand. Its price to earnings ratio was 10 (as of May 2018), which would mean a 25% bump in stock price. 

*In March 2020* [Micron surprised analysts by earning $405 million, 36 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter ending in February.](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/micron-mu-stock-offers-hope-in-turbulent-market/) Certainly strong performance despite being at the start of the pandemic.

*The results sent MU stock up over 5% on March 26, although shares are down over 3% in mid-morning trading March 27.*

Shares rose sharply thanks to a [conservative outlook from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-earnings-conservative-outlook-seen-as-prudent-but-rest-of-year-remains-a-big-question-2020-03-23), who has seen many booms and busts in his 30 years as a memory company executive.

*Last week, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a letter that the company took early precautions in January to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in its facilities in China and the rest of Asia and expanded those protections as the virus spread world-wide.*

*We have also carefully managed raw materials and our supply chain to maintain our manufacturing capabilities and production, Mehrotra said. Our global team has shown tremendous strength and solidarity, operating with excellence despite lockdowns and quarantines that challenged staffing, shipments and work schedules.*

Because memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a supercycle, with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.

*Analysis as of today 24th of November 2021:*
Memory has been going through a super-cycle for years now, this is due to SSDs/flash memory replacing standard HDDs in consumer devices and more recently in data centres. SSDs/flash memory are faster and more reliable. As the price has been coming down for SSDs/flash memory, the switch to these has accelerated. 

Analysts may warn that this super-cycle is peaking, however it is just [cooling down](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107140009). And as outlined in my previous DD, in 2023, 2024 and the future. We can actually expect memory demand to exponentially increase. 

[Chart showing price projections of various DRAM product categories for Q3](https://imgur.com/bPkMum5)

The current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (The super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&amp;no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/). As well as cloud-computing. 

Mehrotra sees it continuing. As outlined in my previous DD, he has set a capital budget of [$150 billion for the next decade.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-plans-over-150-billion-in-capital-r-d-spending-in-decade-ahead-11634724001). Please see my last DD or the link for more info on this budget. 


TL;DR:
Fridays performance was strong due to Evercore ISI Analyst upgrades, as well as a Citi upgrade.

Mondays performance was due to the Evercore ISI and Citi analyst upgrades, as well as other factors including; CNBC article, LPDDR5X DRAM announcement, and other articles released/general hype. It was one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

Tuesdays performance was due to Mizuho analyst upgrade. It was also one of the top discussed stocks on WSB.

Microns LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speed.


*Microns Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1 node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.*

TL;DR of the TL;DR:
Analyst upgrades, hype and new RAM technology have contributed to the price rise this week. NAND flash shipments are rising Q3. There is a supply shortage across the market.

What I was  going to do was to invest 30% in something like VTI (U.S. total market),  20% something like VXUS (international market), 10% bonds, and split  the remaining 40% equally among the MFs in the attached picture. They  all have been growing more than 20% in 10, 5, 3 years time frames. So it  will be around 4% in each MF in the attached list.

I  know there are some redundancy but this way if one MF does not perform  well then it wouldn't affect my portfolio too much. The expense ratio is  too high but if you put $10,000 into one of these MFs then the fee  would be around $70 but if they continue to beat the market by about  10%, that would be $1000 a year. These funds need dedicated people to be  able to beat the market over a long period so the expense ratio seems  necessary to outperform the market.  I am looking for comments on this  strategy.

I  did a backtest for 10 years with an initial amount of $1000 and  invested $1000/month and my final balance would be $202,000 vs $150,000  so a difference of $50,000. The fee difference would have been around  $5000.

Thanks

**Part 1: Supply Chain Update**

You may have seen the good news this week, with stories like:

* [Supply-Chain Problems Show Signs of Easing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-chain-problems-show-signs-of-easing-11637496002)
* [Port of Los Angeles making great progress in reducing backlog, official says](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/11/17/port-of-los-angeles-backlog-shipping)

One of the statistics I've seen thrown around is that ""[the ports have seen a decline of 33% in aging cargo on the docks](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/california-ports-report-supply-chain-progress-delay-fines-for-lingering-cargo.html)."" But there is a problem here, as the number of ships waiting to unload has actually grown to an all time high today. And call me a conspiracy theorist (I'm not), or a healthy skeptic, but I do not believe one second that ""air quality"" of LA (of all places) is the reason for [requiring ships to wait 150 miles out](https://www.businessinsider.com/cargo-ships-queues-pushed-150-miles-from-southern-california-coast-2021-11). I think it is a fear of the photo ops. No matter the real reason, if the problem is easing why does it matter? And this is during a period in which the backlog supposedly got better, ships were diverted to other ports with less congestion, like Seattle. On a recent drive past the port of Seattle, I was shocked to see how many containers have flooded in. But [now they're out of space](https://theloadstar.com/port-of-seattle-becomes-the-latest-casualty-of-container-congestion/), so I must ask where will the ships currently coming go? To me, it sounds like they'll hop back in line in Cali.

Why does this matter? Because less ships available means less cargo capacity. Less cargo capacity by ship means more needs to be moved by air. It also means ocean freight rates skyrocket, in turn pushing airfreight rates up dramatically. And based on the above, *I do not believe this is subsiding anytime soon.*

**Part 2: The New Era of Air Freight Rates**

So we've got significantly boosted earnings for a while to come. But what happens when it eventually subsides? Well, I believe AAWW will continue to reap big profits as airfreight rates will settle well above pre-pandemic rates

I want to mention inflation here because there is something interesting here. I believe inflation is playing a feedback loop on airfreight rates. Sure, the act of increasing freight rates is naturally a driver of inflation. But as inflation increases, the giant pool of printed money does not get allocated to every entity (consumer, company, funds, etc) in equal measures. Instead it finds its way to those with more utility or value add. In the context of a laptop, you'll have the foundry that makes semiconductors, the factory that made the plastic shell, the factory that makes the laptop, the store that sold it to you, the shipper that transported it to the store, etc etc. That logistical piece has been long neglected. Now, companies realize how important it is and the natural spending allocation to it will remain increased. I hope I am explaining this theory well enough - I'm happy to elaborate but also don't want to bore you all.

Other factors come from AAWW competitors (and customers). Groups like Amazon have [used freight as a loss-leading measure](https://outvio.com/blog/amazon-shipping-policy/) to gobble up market share and capture America in their ecosystem. Airlines used to offer rock bottom rates to fill the belly of aircraft that were already going from Point A to Point B anyways. Both of these will change. In a new inflationary world, companies will be expected to post profit. And Airlines can no longer afford to use freight for small extra cash, as they have very large debts to repay. They'll instead be using airfreight as a core element of their offerings going forward.

Oh, and let's not forget - key airfreight rates are to and from China. Pretend for a second that the world is reopening [despite the renewed lockdowns](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/24/germany-considers-a-full-covid-lockdown-and-mandatory-vaccines.html). Do you really think tourism to China and Asia will fill passenger aircraft on those routes? These route-specific dislocations offer massive benefit to companies like AAWW.

**Part 3: Locking in Rates**

AAWW has also been actively locking in long term contracts at elevated rates. Sure, they don't lock in at rates *this* high, but they still do drive significantly higher long term profits. Lets listen to this gem from the Q3 earnings call:

&gt;...But then to get to the duration of these long-term charter contracts, the vast majority of them go into 2022, and 2023. Some of them go into 2024 and 2025. During the quarter, we added an aircraft with a customer for a term of 3.6 years, so it goes through April 2025, at a really good rate. We also extended term with another customer that goes to October 2024, with a higher rate. And so on a fairly regular basis customer's are extending these agreements at higher rates, so we feel good about the long-term charter business. -**Spencer Schwartz,** *Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer*

(I can't link this website, you can search for the transcripts of the call.)

On top of the above, I believe a lot of companies are waiting for ""supply chain issues to ease"" before they negotiate contract extensions. For the reasons I mentioned above above, I think they are on a fool's errand. If I am correct about this, we may see contract renewal rates jump dramatically in Q1-Q2 of next year as a bunch of companies try to all at once, when they see that these freight rates just aren't going down like they're ""supposed to."" You'll note my significant options allocation to Jan and Feb when I think this will become more evident.

So let's do some critical thinking. Contracts with locked in rates are going 2-3.5 years out. AAWW has a P/E of 5.5. Using a DCF model, half of the market cap is paid for, and that is excluding any surge pricing we're getting from the non locked rates over the next few quarters AND the potential for a windfall with even *greater* long-term contract rates. Now *that* is deep fucking value.

**Part 4: YOLO Update**

Thanks a million $AAWW! I am now a millionaire (including my other cash and work-related accounts).

I did cash out *some* AAWW. It was not due to low conviction in my thesis or anything else related to the company. It was solely for the purpose of derisking my account as my AAWW position grew too large for my comfort in any single equity. I am still in with a large amount, and I still believe in my original bear-base-bull case targets of 120-150-180.

And call me a conspiracy theorist (I'm not), or a healthy skeptic, but I do not believe one second that ""air quality"" of LA (of all places) is the reason for [requiring ships to wait 150 miles out](https://www.businessinsider.com/cargo-ships-queues-pushed-150-miles-from-southern-california-coast-2021-11). I think it is a fear of the photo ops. No matter the real reason, if the problem is easing why does it matter? And this is during a period in which the backlog supposedly got better, ships were diverted to other ports with less congestion, like Seattle. On a recent drive past the port of Seattle, I was shocked to see how many containers have flooded in. But [now they're out of space](https://theloadstar.com/port-of-seattle-becomes-the-latest-casualty-of-container-congestion/), so I must ask where will the ships currently coming go? To me, it sounds like they'll hop back in line in Cali.

Why does this matter? Because less ships available means less cargo capacity. Less cargo capacity by ship means more needs to be moved by air. It also means ocean freight rates skyrocket, in turn pushing airfreight rates up dramatically. And based on the above, *I do not believe this is subsiding anytime soon.*

**Part 2: The New Era of Air Freight Rates**

So we've got significantly boosted earnings for a while to come. But what happens when it eventually subsides? Well, I believe AAWW will continue to reap big profits as airfreight rates will settle well above pre-pandemic rates

I want to mention inflation here because there is something interesting here. I believe inflation is playing a feedback loop on airfreight rates. Sure, the act of increasing freight rates is naturally a driver of inflation. But as inflation increases, the giant pool of printed money does not get allocated to every entity (consumer, company, funds, etc) in equal measures. Instead it finds its way to those with more utility or value add. In the context of a laptop, you'll have the foundry that makes semiconductors, the factory that made the plastic body, the factory that makes the laptop, the store that sold it to you, the shipper that transported it to the store, etc etc. That logistical piece has been long neglected. Now, companies realize how important it is and the natural spending allocation to it will remain increased. I hope I am explaining this theory well enough - I'm happy to elaborate but also don't want to bore you all.

Other factors come from AAWW competitors (and customers). Groups like Amazon have [used freight as a loss-leading measure](https://outvio.com/blog/amazon-shipping-policy/) to gobble up market share and capture America in their ecosystem. Airlines used to offer rock bottom rates to fill the belly of aircraft that were already going from Point A to Point B anyways. Both of these will change. In a new inflationary world, companies will be expected to post profit. And Airlines can no longer afford to use freight for small extra cash, as they have very large debts to repay. They'll instead be using airfreight as a core element of their offerings going forward.

Oh, and let's not forget - key airfreight rates are to and from China. Pretend for a second that the world is reopening [despite the renewed lockdowns](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/24/germany-considers-a-full-covid-lockdown-and-mandatory-vaccines.html). Do you really think tourism to China and Asia will fill passenger aircraft on those routes? These route-specific dislocations offer massive benefit to companies like AAWW. 

**Part 3: Locking in Rates**

AAWW has also been actively locking in long term contracts at elevated rates. Sure, they don't lock in at rates *this* high, but they still do drive significantly higher long term profits. Lets listen to this gem from the Q3 earnings call:

&gt;...But then to get to the duration of these long-term charter contracts, the vast majority of them go into 2022, and 2023. Some of them go into 2024 and 2025. During the quarter, we added an aircraft with a customer for a term of 3.6 years, so it goes through April 2025, at a really good rate. We also extended term with another customer that goes to October 2024, with a higher rate. And so on a fairly regular basis customer's are extending these agreements at higher rates, so we feel good about the long-term charter business. -**Spencer Schwartz,** *Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer*

(I can't link this website, you can search for the transcripts of the call.)

On top of the above, I believe a lot of companies are waiting for ""supply chain issues to ease"" before they negotiate contract extensions. For the reasons I mentioned above above, I think they are on a fool's errand. If I am correct about this, we may see contract renewal rates jump dramatically in Q1-Q2 of next year as a bunch of companies try to all at once, when they see that these freight rates just aren't going down like they're ""supposed to."" You'll note my significant options allocation to Jan and Feb when I think this will become more evident.

So let's do some critical thinking. Contracts with locked in rates are going 2-3.5 years out. AAWW has a P/E of 5.5. Using a DCF model, half of the market cap is paid for, and that is excluding any surge pricing we're getting from the non locked rates over the next few quarters AND the potential for a windfall with even *greater* long-term contract rates. Now *that* is deep fucking value.

**Part 4: YOLO Update**

Thanks a million $AAWW! I am now a millionaire (including my other cash and work-related accounts).

I did cash out *some* AAWW. It was not due to low conviction in my thesis or anything else related to the company. It was solely for the purpose of derisking my account as my AAWW position grew too large for my comfort in any single equity. I am still in with a large amount, and I still believe in my original bear-base-bull case targets of 120-150-180.

Altos Labs research is centred on biological reprogramming, a technique discovered in 2006 by scientist Shinya Yamanaka, who will chair the companys scientific advisory board. Yamanakas work revealed that after adding just four proteins, now known as Yamanaka factors, cells can be made pluripotent  that is, able to become any cell in the b0dy.

In 2016, a study led by Spanish biochemist Juan Carlos Izpisa Belmonte, who will be joining Altos Labs, saw the technique reduce cellular and physiological signs of ageing in living mice and extend their lifespan by an average of six weeks. Following the studys success, Izpisa Belmonte hailed cellular reprogramming as the elixir of life.

Another study, published in 2020, successfully restored the eyesight of mice using the technique.

The new discovery encapsulated in the patent includes a powerful new way to unblock the secretion signal from the hypothalamus, thereby stimulating the anterior pituitary gland to naturally secrete human growth hormone (HGH).

One of the major contributors to aging and the decline in cardiovascular health is the increase in the production of [dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4). ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=euT_KjTU0mYgUyNYqmjtwUFdo719bWKZU-TrYb9I6nBtUb8nyWuDG0n08xvELIRm2zOsQ25ryQ_QIm8PYc8MBnCWU9ziqMR14apP92Itp7v9QUWCUsMgN8k8CtcdaxNx6BJJzWzY1IIXUv1bTvh7rA==)DPP4 acts a signal to the anterior pituitary and it degrades over time as humans biologically age. With a new combination of natural ingredients including Tahitian NONI fruit and pterostilbene, NewAge scientists have developed a method of action to unblock the DPP4 signal by 99.1% and allow the secretion from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary, thereby triggering the b0dy to naturally regulate itself and secrete growth hormone, as it did when the b0dy was in growth and development mode versus in the aging process.

The filing of this patent and unveiling of this unique discovery is an incredible achievement in both science and technology to help people take control of the aging process and age healthy, said Brett West, NewAges Senior Director of Research. This is the first product to simultaneously address specific multiple pathways by which Human Growth Hormone declines in the b0dy. The results from our laboratory studies and trials represent real scientific breakthrough with globally relevant applications, and we are incredibly proud of the team that contributed to the discovery.

In addition to unblocking the hypothalamus secretion signal, NewAge scientists have leveraged a mechanism to suppress somatostatin release and stimulate the anterior pituitary gland, a major organ of the b0dys endocrine system that affects growth, hormone production, and regulation. Growth hormone is essential during childhood development and continues to help maintain tissue and organ health throughout ones lifetime. As a person ages, however, the amount of HGH produced slows dramatically. This decline is due in part to both a reduction in GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and an increase in somatostatin, also known as a GH-inhibiting hormone (GHIH). In addition, an enzyme produced in the b0dy  dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4)  also works to inhibit GHRH, thereby contributing to further decline resulting in lower energy levels, reduced muscle mass, weight gain, and a variety of other age-related changes. NewAge has discovered a natural way to simultaneously inhibit DPP4 and decrease somatostatin.

Now listen to this.Following publication in the [Journal of Biosciences and Medicine](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fc_eHgyMKhEBpxPG12mRzItZxN8xrZTYZOffRewaBMJXxsbmugLrrUiqp5OCD6sYoHRL77hY3l6kh3k-2KfQI59BZV96NnV7TmkmuWnf0GppgO9Ak7qZR-Rz0RvCvPbg7buV-rNq3Iw8sXkE_1c9Zsv4gdUtByl4CkS2_qWG7IQ=) of the recent discovery on how to block spike proteins from binding to human cells, NewAge scientists have filed for a patent that contains multiple unique claims, and a new discovery that supports cardiovascular health and anti-aging. The new discovery encapsulated in the patent includes a powerful new way to unblock the secretion signal from the hypothalamus, thereby stimulating the anterior pituitary gland to naturally secrete human growth hormone (HGH).

One of the major contributors to aging and the decline in cardiovascular health is the increase in the production of [dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4). ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=euT_KjTU0mYgUyNYqmjtwUFdo719bWKZU-TrYb9I6nBtUb8nyWuDG0n08xvELIRm2zOsQ25ryQ_QIm8PYc8MBnCWU9ziqMR14apP92Itp7v9QUWCUsMgN8k8CtcdaxNx6BJJzWzY1IIXUv1bTvh7rA==)DPP4 acts a signal to the anterior pituitary and it degrades over time as humans biologically age. With a new combination of natural ingredients including Tahitian NONI fruit and pterostilbene, NewAge scientists have developed a method of action to unblock the DPP4 signal by 99.1% and allow the secretion from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary, thereby triggering the body to naturally regulate itself and secrete growth hormone, as it did when the body was in growth and development mode versus in the aging process.

The filing of this patent and unveiling of this unique discovery is an incredible achievement in both science and technology to help people take control of the aging process and age healthy, said Brett West, NewAges Senior Director of Research. This is the first product to simultaneously address specific multiple pathways by which Human Growth Hormone declines in the body. The results from our laboratory studies and trials represent real scientific breakthrough with globally relevant applications, and we are incredibly proud of the team that contributed to the discovery.

In addition to unblocking the hypothalamus secretion signal, NewAge scientists have leveraged a mechanism to suppress somatostatin release and stimulate the anterior pituitary gland, a major organ of the bodys endocrine system that affects growth, hormone production, and regulation. Growth hormone is essential during childhood development and continues to help maintain tissue and organ health throughout ones lifetime. As a person ages, however, the amount of HGH produced slows dramatically. This decline is due in part to both a reduction in GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and an increase in somatostatin, also known as a GH-inhibiting hormone (GHIH). In addition, an enzyme produced in the body  dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4)  also works to inhibit GHRH, thereby contributing to further decline resulting in lower energy levels, reduced muscle mass, weight gain, and a variety of other age-related changes. NewAge has discovered a natural way to simultaneously inhibit DPP4 and decrease somatostatin.

***Pretty nice , right?***

***Brennan ED*** *,Director at NewAge,* has the same opinion as me. Not only that , but on 18 NOV he buys another **500.000 shares.** I don't have to see the future in order to realise that a filing of patent and such an insider transaction are signs that something big is coming

***Tell me your opinion***

What's your opinion on this? For me , they didn't get me to invest with their ass beverages , but this research made me throw 10k$ on them.

Looking at the chart also , there is a lot of upside room. They went from 1$ to 9$ in the past without the anti aging research. So i question myself if they will reach new ATH in the near future

Stock Price: 1,28$

And I am an anonymous blogger. I have my reasons for remaining anonymous, and those reasons don't matter. Can you really trust articles on Bloomberg or Wall Street Journal any more than an anonymous opinion? All I ask is to debate the content of my message. Not who I am or my motivations. If you agree with what I say and think that it's in-depth, quality and truthful work, then make sure to share this on every retail channel available to you. Reddit, Discord, Stocktwits, Twitter, Telegram, Whatsapp, Tiktok and wherever else. If these ideas go viral, retail can make a lot of money at the expense of dirty shorter tactics, hedge funds and other HFT traders. 

The stock that I think is ripe for a gamma squeeze are Gores Guggenheim, Inc. (NASDAQ:GGPI) a.k.a. the ""Polestar SPAC"".

First off GGPI. GGPI is in the right industry as it will be merging with Polestar, an electric vehicle company that is further along than recent IPOs like SEV, RIVN, LCID and FSR. Despite that, at GGPI at $15, Polestar's $30 billion post-merger valuation is less than half of most of these companies. A blog post on Seeking Alpha with a target of $35 puts forth a straightforward fundamental argument for going long GGPI: 

CCIV, the former SPAC shell for LCID, ran from $10 to $63 in a little over a month in January, and started off eerily similarly to how GGPI is trading now:

CCIV was considered overvalued at the time and did crash post-merger, but LCID has since come roaring back to challenge the highs it made as CCIV. This is a blueprint for GGPI, with $35 being a decent target based on effective valuation as well as float as GGPI has 80 million shares outstanding. 

But the gamma squeeze potential is what needs to be addressed here for the short term gains I expect over the next couple of days. The funds have been trying hard to keep GGPI under $15, and for good reason. This is a screen shot of the call options outstanding for November's expiry:

Each strike price above $10 has tens of thousands of options outstanding. A couple of weeks ago when many of those options were written, the $10's were expected to be slightly in-the-money while the $12.50's out-of-the-money. Both of these options will be deeply in the money. They combine for 37,408 contracts, representing 3.74 million shares that must be presented to call option holders.

Two questions will come up to debate this. 

1. The retail option holders will likely sell their options in order to avoid taking possession of the stock and running

Two questions will come up to debate this. 

1. The retail option holders will likely sell their options in order to avoid taking possession of the stock and running into margin issues. 

Yes and no. When you look at the volume compared to the open interest, only a small percentage of in-the-money call option holders are closing off their trades. There are only two trading days left before expiry and with that small volume relative to the open interest, I don't expect that open interest to decrease. Plus the call option seller isn't necessarily selling back to a call option writer. It could be a third party who is buying the option and wants to take possession of the stock instead of buying on the open market for whatever reason, and the call option writer is still obligated to sell the shares to them. 

2. The volume of shares that this represents is still only a small part of the trading volume, so it should be easily absorbed. 

This is an issue with high frequency and bot trading. The 80 million share float has flipped over three times in the last four days. This is highly indicative of HFT traders selling to each other repeatedly in order to spoof the volume and make it look like the covering of any shorts or presentation of any shares from option writing is no big deal. Two firms could sell 100,000 shares back and forth to each other in mirrored bot programs dozens of times a day. The 3.74 million shares that must be presented in a real transaction that has to take place. It's 5% of the float which is pretty significant and can cause a gamma run that can't be hidden behind large volume. In fact, large volume only hurts them as large volume and increasing share price is a very bullish signal for retail traders. 

The $15 strikes and higher are where the option writers can come into a world of hurt. And this is why they have been working so hard to keep the $15 resistance. An additional 20,884 in open interest, representing over 2 million shares would need to be presented to option holders if GGPI lands over $15. There's an additional 3 million shares worth at the three price intervals above $15 up to $22.5. If this was to run, it would be similar to what we have seen on IONQ in the last couple of days. IONQ wasn't looking too hopeful immediately after its earning report when it was trading in the $18's after hours. That was the market makers trying and failing to keep a lid on that stock price at $20. IONQ's $20 is GGPI's $15. If GGPI breaks $15, it's off to the races. Especially since the same funds tend to work across multiple SPACs. So if they are hurting on IONQ, they are more vulnerable on GGPI.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r14p68/the_stock_with_the_best_gamma_squeeze_potential/

SPACs and wsb have had a special relationship. Just like the relationship between web and electric vehicles. In case youve been living in your wifes boyfriends basement, EV stocks have been drilling towards the stratosphere in the past couple weeks. The latest spike in EV interest has been the result of a bunch of factors, but the biggest one seems to be good ol supply and demand.

With rising issues surround climate change, interest in sustainable and eco friendly fuels rises with it.

&amp;#x200B;

In late September, GGPI announced that it will be taking EV company Polestar public. Polestar itself is an offshoot of Volvo and Geely Automobiles.

Polestar currently has two vehicles types, the Polestar 1 and 2, both for sale across Europe, North America, and Asia. A couple users in this subreddit have even commented stating that they have seen the vehicles driving around New York city, meaning that they are out and about in the American populace.

Thats right. Theyve actually sold product. Mind fuckin blown.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

GGPI anticipates increasing 2020 sales of 10,000 vehicles to 290,000 vehicles sold in 2025.

The company has added 46 new retail locations in 2021, which includes 20 U.S. locations. New York City and Boston are among the latest U.S. retail locations added. The company has 86 retail locations open globally as of Monday. Polestar reports that over two million people have visited company retail locations since August 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

**Use of Funds**

Back in September when the initial merger was announced, it was noted that GGPI would provide $800 million in cash. Further, an additional $250 million in PIPE financing is being provided in the deal.

As announced then, Proceeds from the business combination are expected to be used to help fund significant investment in products and the expansion of operations and markets to create a leading company in the rapidly growing global premium EV market.

The two firms have provided recent updates to those initial plans. Polestar vehicles are available in 14 markets. In 2021 Polestar will expand into eight additional markets in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.

Those funds will also be used to increase its manufacturing footprint. Polestar is manufactured at two plants in China, with future manufacturing planned in the U.S.

So, thats where the funding is being spent. The company intends to increase its market presence to 30 distinct geographies by the end of 2023.

**The Lineup**

The companys **Polestar 1** is a hybrid vehicle that will stop production in late 2021. The companys **Polestar 2** is a fully electric car that has been well-received by the market and won many awards.

A fully electric SUV called **Polestar 3** is expected to be the companys next vehicle produced. It will challenge the Porsche Cayenne

&amp;#x200B;

**Big News**

The big news though, is that GGPI has announced a clearer date for the close of the business combination.

The Nov. 15 news clarified that the business combination is expected to occur in the first half of 2022. There hadnt been much news since the September announcement. Consequently, prices had been flat. The Nov. 15 announcement renewed interest, spiking prices from $10 to $15. Theyve since fallen back to about $13.50.

Thats what investors should expect heading into the first half of 2022. A series of announcements and corresponding spikes in price and interest around Polestar vehicles.

Investors likely want to know what Polestars future lineup will look like.

**Future Lineup**

Polestar will release three vehicles, one each year in 2022, 2023 and 2024. The company makes it very clear that it is aiming to erode the market position that Porsche has carved out for itself.

Polestar will release a competitor to the Cayenne SUV in 2022. Then it plans to release a vehicle slotted against the smaller Porsche Macan SUV in 2023. In 2024, it plans to release a luxury sedan to compete with the Panamera.

Each of those vehicles are stated to have a range of 600 kilometers, or roughly 370 miles.

Polestar says it has 35 permanent locations with plans to expand to over 150 locations by the end of 2023. The company expects to be operating in 30 markets by the end of 2023

Polestar 4 (2023)  smaller SUV that will exhibit a coupe-like profile and is set to compete with the Porsche Macan and the Tesla Model Y.

Polestar 5 (2024)  sports sedan inspired by the Precept concept car, competing with the Tesla Model S.

&amp;#x200B;

Thomas Ingenlath is a German car designer and is currently CEO of Polestar and previously Senior Vice President Design at Volvo Cars.

Ingenlath obtained an MA in Vehicle Design at the Royal College of Art in London following his degree at Fachhochschule fr Gestaltung in Pforzheim, Germany.

He joined the Volkswagen Group and worked for Audi, chief exterior designer for Volkswagen and then in 2000 was appointed Chief Designer at Skoda. In 2006 he was promoted to Director of Design at the Volkswagen Design Center in Potsdam.

In 2012 he moved to Volvo and head of design and in 2017 became CEO of the Polestar subsidiary.

**EV Pure Play Comparison**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y7jqclgtjj181.png?width=1389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f4ff34d43ce27df2733fc623ac0f1b9838e7683

Listen, we all love Daddy Elon. But I am here to make money and fuck bitches, and I'm all out of bitches.

The Polestar 2 is obviously a direct competitor to the Tesla Model 3. In fact, the comparisons to Tesla are inevitable, especially since Polestar is one of the very few pure-play electric vehicle companies with revenues. (*Were only assuming they have revenues because weve been given nothing but estimates so far.*) Like Tesla, Polestar uses a direct-to-consumer model, with 20 retail locations in the United States alone, with plans to have 35 locations by the end of 2022.

Its worth noting that it took Tesla the better part of a decade to deliver its first cars built entirely by the company, because before 2012 manufacturing of the Tesla Roadsters was largely outsourced to Lotus Cars. Founded in 2003, Tesla broke 31,000 deliveries by 2014  about the same number of cars that Polestar expects to put on roads this year. Polestar claims it will deliver 290,000 cars by 2025, which would only put it slightly ahead of Teslas four-year production when it delivered about 245,000 vehicles by 2018.

Presumably most of the promised money is coming from sales of Polestar 2, the companys first fully electric vehicle is for sale for just under $40,000. Also, because it is an EV, it is eligible for federal tax credits. The long-range single motor can cover 265 miles on a single charge, while the dual-motor option brings more than 400 horsepower to the road and can hit 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds with just a little less range. Apple lovers may hate the fact that the Polestar 2 uses Googles new Android Automotive OS infotainment system. The reviews by the usual automotive experts have been positive and sometimes glowing  One of the most complete electric cars money can buy.  so it appears that Polestar is putting out a quality product.

**The Bottom Line on GGPI Stock**

Given the fact that EVs are hot again, I see GGPI stock rising. In short, this stock makes my dick hard.

GGPI is a sleeping giant with very little attention upon it. Simply put, the market hasnt realized this stock exists yet. It will be pulled up as more investors simply become aware that it is bringing Polestar public.

Thats something to consider as the first half of 2022 nears, and excitement around Polestar inevitably builds.

$GGPI is an EV auto maker that is Polestar public. The cars are incredibly well built, are already on the road, and are a direct competitor with Tesla and Porsche. GGPI already has 29,000 cars on the road, many of which are in the USA. In 2021 to date, revenue earned is approx $1.5B. The stock is still trading way below its competitors ceterus paribus.

**EV Pure Play Comparison**

Listen, we all love Daddy Elon. But I am here to make money and fuck bitches, and I'm all out of bitches.

The Polestar 2 is obviously a direct competitor to the Tesla Model 3. In fact, the comparisons to Tesla are inevitable, especially since Polestar is one of the very few pure-play electric vehicle companies with revenues. (*Were only assuming they have revenues because weve been given nothing but estimates so far.*) Like Tesla, Polestar uses a direct-to-consumer model, with 20 retail locations in the United States alone, with plans to have 35 locations by the end of 2022.

Its worth noting that it took Tesla the better part of a decade to deliver its first cars built entirely by the company, because before 2012 manufacturing of the Tesla Roadsters was largely outsourced to Lotus Cars. Founded in 2003, Tesla broke 31,000 deliveries by 2014  about the same number of cars that Polestar expects to put on roads this year. Polestar claims it will deliver 290,000 cars by 2025, which would only put it slightly ahead of Teslas four-year production when it delivered about 245,000 vehicles by 2018.

Presumably most of the promised money is coming from sales of Polestar 2, the companys first fully electric vehicle is for sale for just under $40,000. Also, because it is an EV, it is eligible for federal tax credits. The long-range single motor can cover 265 miles on a single charge, while the dual-motor option brings more than 400 horsepower to the road and can hit 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds with just a little less range. Apple lovers may hate the fact that the Polestar 2 uses Googles new Android Automotive OS infotainment system. The reviews by the usual automotive experts have been positive and sometimes glowing  One of the most complete electric cars money can buy.  so it appears that Polestar is putting out a quality product. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bottom Line on GGPI Stock**

Given the fact that EVs are hot again, I see GGPI stock rising. In short, this stock makes my dick hard.

GGPI is a sleeping giant with very little attention upon it. Simply put, the market hasnt realized this stock exists yet. It will be pulled up as more investors simply become aware that it is bringing Polestar public. 

Thats something to consider as the first half of 2022 nears, and excitement around Polestar inevitably builds.

$GGPI is an EV auto maker that is Polestar public. The cars are incredibly well built, are already on the road, and are a direct competitor with Tesla and Porsche. GGPI already has 29,000 cars on the road, many of which are in the USA. In 2021 to date, revenue earned is approx $1.5B. The stock is still trading way below its competitors ceterus paribus.

1,"11/24/2021, 20:33:07",Blackberry is more than a meme and heres why,C_W_4,"As most of you retards know by now, Blackberry is no longer the phone company that it first was. They are predominantly focusing on cybersecurity and have a huge proportion of the EV manufacturers using their systems (23 of the top 25 electric vehicle automakers to be precise). The system Im referring to is called QNX and its pretty impressive. I wont bore you and write up about it so if you want to find out more, go onto BlackBerrys website/google it for yourself.

Now, Im on WSB for a reason, Im partially retarded so Ill keep this as short and sweet for the sake of everyone including myself. 

The global electric vehicle market was valued at $162.34 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $802.81 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 22.6%. Blackberry already have an advantage in the EV space and they continue to build on this every year. The opportunity for growth is significant in my opinion. 

SE Labs has rated BlackBerry as the best new endpoint security offering of 2021. (This was only announced yesterday).

Heres a bit about SE Labs for those of you that dont know

SE Labs prides itself on providing the most realistic and honest cybersecurity testing. The organization hires innovative researchers to replicate the most accurate real world testing scenarios possible. As workplaces open and hybrid work brings with it a range of new attack vectors, its even more critical that security software be tested against these evolving threats.

And heres what the CEO of SE Labs, Simon Edwards, had to say about Blackberry

2021 has been the first year we have tested this product with BlackBerry publicly. When judging for our annual awards it is hard to ignore when a new, significant vendor enters our tests and performs so well from the start. 

Blackberry has demonstrated excellent performance in our real-world testing, and the product is well regarded by both our expert panel of judges and users of the product.

Take this as you please, Im no financial advisor but for those of you constantly writing off Blackberry and saying its a hype stock, I think you need to re evaluate and realise why people are genuinely excited about this stock. 

Both short term and long term potential in this stock IMO.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading you beautiful bitch.

The pullback over the last year was expected as investors cycled into re-opening stocks, while China also ramped up regulations on tech firms. 

However, increased competition and weaker demand expected out of China have made the situation worse, pushing Ali Baba to forecast revenue to grow at its slowest rate since 2014. The stock is approaching record lowson its Hong Kong listed shares, and is nearing 3-yearlows on the NASDAQ.

If $BABA  breaks below the support level near $130, it will be at its lowest levels since December 2018, and it could find itself in free fall

While this makes a lot of sense (calculated risk mitigation &amp; informed forecast), it's quite difficult (at least for me) to pin-down what exactly they spend that time on.

1000hours or 6 months etc. is a lot of time, which can potentially reveal a lot of more or less useful stuff about a company... so the question is what's the ""optimal"" breakdown of that time?

I mean... I understand it'd be useful to come to the point in which you can predict the CEO's bowel movements to the second within a margin of error of 0.001%... but I don't see how spending however much time that information took to work out being beneficial. ... so there should be a "" ok... 300 hours working out this particular ""lead"" is enough.

1,"11/24/2021, 18:52:35",What is the possibility of a turnaround for $wish?,otimanob,"The news of getting banned from france couldnt have come on a better days. Wish has lost 84% of its value since ipo, sitting at only 2B market cap. The revenue has shrinked yoy. Money keeps getting burnt massively. Insiders keep diluting their shares every other days. They didnt provide any guidelines for the next quarter. On top of that ceo just stepped down in the middle these crisises, who was on board for more than 10 years. Whose gonna be his replacement? 

They have a reputation of selling shitty products. When you think of wish, you think of dildos viagra and all sorts of other weird stuffs. They have massive followers in all social platform but the user engagement is pretty low which questions the authenticity of those followers. Their app Isn't even surfable wothout creating an account. Misleading pricing is also a big issue.

With all those stated above, does $wish have a chance to turn around? They still have a decent MAUs who they can capitalize on. They have recently announced merchant reward program which would make it easier to sort out the better product. They have also recently did a webiner with was about connectinng marchent with the users using presta shop. Some of the products review from wish on youtube that I have watched have been quite decent. Its not half as bad. You get what you pay for. The refund policy is also not bad. You get your money back if you dont get your products in time. They also have wish local and recently they sacced wish whole sale and initgrated into the original app. Their logistic business has chances to grow.

They also have some other apps including the newly launched 1sansome. Basically its a clone of tiktok but for shopping. So creators go there and review products by uploading short videos. In returns they get free gifts and 12% sales commisons. What I have seen so far it only offers ladies clothes. What do you really make of it? Does it have any potential or is it another failed project?

Jackie Reses is an excecutive chair in wish. She worked with Goldman Sachs, alibaba, square and yahoo!. They are did a few c-suit hiring this year including Vivian liu. They also have over 200 job opening on Engineering and product desingns. With the ceo stepping down, who couldnt make a single profit in 10 years where do you think they are heading to?

They are also cutting down on ads. Its been proven in the past if they decrease ad spending theyre profitability goes higher. Now that they have a large audience, should they focus on existing customer or keep trying to acquire new ones? 

Finally wish has taken steps to redesign the app. They have said that it will no longer be needed to login into the app in order to search stuffs.

The quality of living has increased in the past decades. People are not afraid to spend a little more money in order to have better quality. That's where we get the boundary. If you sell for too little, you have to compromise on quality, if you sell at higher price, the customers then will just go for a named brand. Thats why $wish have to find a niche line. Ok maybe Im just overthinking.


With all these gibberish writting where do you see wish in next 5 months and 5 years? Will wish be able to remove its bad reputation and start making profit? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r12ir0/what_is_the_possibility_of_a_turnaround_for_wish/

1,"11/24/2021, 17:43:55",Blackberry is more than a meme and heres why,C_W_4,"As most of you retards know by now, Blackberry is no longer the phone company that it first was. They are predominantly focusing on cybersecurity and have a huge proportion of the EV manufacturers using their systems (23 of the top 25 electric vehicle automakers to be precise). The system Im referring to is called QNX and its pretty impressive. I wont bore you and write up about it so if you want to find out more, go onto BlackBerrys website/google it for yourself.

Now, Im on WSB for a reason, Im partially retarded so Ill keep this as short and sweet for the sake of everyone including myself. 

The global electric vehicle market was valued at $162.34 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $802.81 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 22.6%. Blackberry already have an advantage in the EV space and they continue to build on this every year. The opportunity for growth is significant in my opinion. 

SE Labs has rated BlackBerry as the best new endpoint security offering of 2021. (This was only announced yesterday).

Heres a bit about SE Labs for those of you that dont know

SE Labs prides itself on providing the most realistic and honest cybersecurity testing. The organization hires innovative researchers to replicate the most accurate real world testing scenarios possible. As workplaces open and hybrid work brings with it a range of new attack vectors, its even more critical that security software be tested against these evolving threats.

And heres what the CEO of SE Labs, Simon Edwards, had to say about Blackberry

2021 has been the first year we have tested this product with BlackBerry publicly. When judging for our annual awards it is hard to ignore when a new, significant vendor enters our tests and performs so well from the start. 

Blackberry has demonstrated excellent performance in our real-world testing, and the product is well regarded by both our expert panel of judges and users of the product.

Take this as you please, Im no financial advisor but for those of you constantly writing off Blackberry and saying its just a hype stock, I think you need to re-evaluate and realise why people are genuinely excited about this stock.

Ill personally be playing this long term, 10-20 years minimum. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading you beautiful bitch.

Some catalyst is (probably) needed to set off a collapse. There are bubbles right now, but I think some security that a lot of finance institutions hold directly or indirectly needs to PROVE worthless for the market to dry up. Take EV as an example. As long as the biggest companies in this sector (i.e Tesla) continue to grow revenues and dont default on any obligations, people will keep having a bullish attitude and keep buying. If and only if one of these large companies run into financial difficulty, fear will spread, financing will not be rolled over, fire sales will ensue, liquidity will dry up and the market will crash. With all the liquidity provided by central banks and governments these days the crash might not last for long.

In 2007, Chuck Prince of Citigroup famously said of the burgeoning financial crisis: ""As long as the music is playing, youve got to get up and dance."" 

The music is playing louder than ever, and it seems that we are missing a few seats. 

I'm going to say it. There are dangerous bubbles that are maturing and growing across several sectors of the economy. The bubbles in the capital markets and in many real estate markets, not to mention the massive inflation of the bubble in the, um, digital 'currency' market, pose significant systemic risks to the global economy. 

The bubbles in the capital markets span the whole industry. Equity markets get the most attention, but bond(especially 'high-yield' junk bonds)and commercial paper paper markets are swelling as well. Due to the unprecedented liquidity of equities and other instruments, investors have even more incentive to move their money to the highest performing asset. This excess liquidity, caused by aggressively expansionary monetary policy, in addition to the COVID-19 restrictions of 2020 causing many people to try their hand in the market for the first time has led to a historic boom in the retail equity market and thereby the critical overvaluation of equities. 

So why is this such a problem? Well, it's complex. In part, it's because these overvalued securities and instruments are used as the basis for more and more lending. That, and these securities are so liquid that they are being used by major banks as cash equivalents to form the ""collateral"", if you will, for higher and higher leverage on larger and larger deals. This in itself is not necessarily destructive, per se, but viewed in the context of a potential shock to the market, it leaves the system very vulnerable to a drop in asset prices. 

Such a drop could be precipitated by retail and some institutional investors exiting the market en masse in response to some downturn in a dash for cash. Asian markets, led by China, are preparing for markedly slowing growth as part of both a natural business cycle and a dangerously indebted real estate sector. It's no longer unrealistic to forecast a non-negligible recession in East Asia within the next four quarters, and sooner if the property valuation crisis in China does not abate. An unchecked financial crisis in China would certainly pop the bubbles in the West. What exactly would occur next, how it would occur, and the depth of the damage exactly is certainly up for debate, but in such a scenario catastrophic damage and wealth destruction would occur. 

Moral of the story: something is up. It can't be ignored any longer. The pieces of a crisis are all here; which way will it go? More importantly, how what investment strategies can an average person take today to help offset the increasing risk of a damaging recession?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0xovl/we_have_to_dance_until_the_music_stops/

1,"11/24/2021, 13:39:15",KLIC September quarter DD,toolbox_financial,"  

Kulicke &amp; Soffa Industries, Inc., (KLIC $57.07) reported September quarter results that were better than initial expectations and guided the December quarter to be above street estimates as the core wire bonder business is performing a bit better than expected given the drop in IC unit volume growth. KLIC is seeing upside to other segments such as high-end LED, advanced packaging tools for thermal compression bonding, and growing opportunities in the automotive segment with power management chips and battery assembly applications.  Over the next couple of years the company's LED pick and place tool could drive revenue in this segment to be over $300 million from around $80 million in FY2021 establishing KLIC with another major growth driver.  The new LED tool addresses more applications besides just final placement including sorting, binning, and adjusting the LEDs on the substrate and is expected to drive much broader customer adoption outside of the initial customer who we believe is Apple. We would be adding to positions of KLIC at current valuations with a move to the $105 range of 15x our FY2022 pro-forma EPS of $6.34 plus the $11.63 in net cash.

The company reported September (Q4FY2021) revenue of $485.3 million up 14.4% sequentially and up 173% versus last year's September quarter and in-line with the company's pre-release of results on November 1, 2021.  Revenue was better than initial estimates driven by strength in general semiconductor, memory and LED revenue coming in at the high end above $80 million for the year. Gross margin was 47.7% up from the 46.1% reported last quarter driven by volume, mix, cost reductions, and ASP increases. Operating profit was a record 31.9% up from 28.4% reported last quarter and the 13.0% reported in last year's September quarter. Pro-forma EPS was $2.17 up from the $1.87 reported last quarter and the $0.35 reported in last year's September quarter and in-line with the pre-released EPS estimate of $2.15-$2.17.

KLIC generated $123 million in cash flow from operations and total cash increased $105 million sequential to $740 million or $11.63 in net cash per share up from the $10.00 in net cash reported last quarter as KLIC continues to be a cash generating machine.  Increasing cash by $4.15 per share over the last twelve months

KLIC's reported FY2021 revenue of $1.52 billion up 144% in versus FY2020 and better than the company's initial $1.50 billion estimate driven by much higher IC unit volume growth in 2021 driving the company's core wire bonder business significantly higher servicing the 5G, EV's, and increasing content and complexity of each IC.  Strong growth in LED displays, service and the automotive recovery also helped revenue growth for the year. Operating income was $412.4 million or 27.2% of revenue in FY2021 up from the 9.4% reported in FY2020 driving huge EPS growth of 482% to $6.14 propelled by the increase in revenue and tight operating expense control.

The company guided December quarter (Q1FY2022) revenue to be $460 million down 5.2% sequentially and up 73% versus last year and better than the street's $411.7 million estimate driven by another strong LED display quarter and less of a decline in the core wire bonder business than initially anticipated.  Gross margin should be around 47% down slightly from the 47.7% reported last quarter. Pro-forma EPS should be $1.88 +/- 10% down from the $2.17 just reported and up from the $0.86 reported last year and better than the street's $1.54 estimate driven by the higher revenue and gross margin. 

KLIC did not update the $1.5 billion revenue estimate for FY2022 (flat with the $1.52 billion just reported in FY2021) but did suggest we might now have a bit of upside to that number as the core wire bonder business declines a bit in calendar 2022 as overall unit volume growth slows from over 20% in 2021 to around 8-10% in 2022.  This decline of around $150-$200 million in core wire bonding revenue in 2022 will be offset by growth in the company's other segments of high-end LED, advanced packaging focused on thermal compression bonding with a large OEM who we believe is Intel, new opportunities in automotive battery assembly and power management segments with customers such as Tesla and increased service revenue producing flat revenue for the year, or as we are forecasting, moderate growth for FY2022 to near $1.6 billion.  Expanding gross margin and operating leverage should produce higher EPS on flat revenue in FY2022. We are now forecasting pro-forma EPS of $6.34 in FY2022 up from the $6.14 just reported.

We would be adding to positions of KLIC at current valuations with a move to the $105 range of 15x our FY2022 pro-forma EPS of $6.34 plus the $11.63 in net cash.  In the near term the core wire bonder business will drop a bit in 2022 but then probably start to grow again in 2023 as increased IC unit volume growth drives up the core business again. The ramp of the LED display business from $80 million to over $100 million in 2022 and the ramp up of new advanced packaging products, in the back half of 2022 in the thermal compression bonding segment, which should double from the $20 million range to over $40 million in 2023 and $80 million in 2024, and growing automotive and battery assembly revenue should allow KLIC to show slight revenue growth in 2022 and higher revenue growth above $1.5 billion in 2023 and 2024 pushing the stock to over $100.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0xnap/klic_september_quarter_dd/

SPR went from 640m barrels in Mar 2021 to 606m barrels in Sept. Delta of 34m barrels.

At the rate of 5m barrels that is 10 months at most they can keep throwing water bottles at a burning building.

Opec has said it will cut production.
China / India / US all face the reality of replenishing at much higher prices.

The political value for the US is to suppress prices till mid terms. They cant suppress the prices, the strategic reserve is far too small to even be a blip on the radar.

The US would need to release 50m barrels _per_month_ to only make a 1.6% dent in the global price of oil.

EV bubble: Will probably won't even affect the whole market. It's not even a big deal and some are comparing it to the housing market bubble (which is much bigger and a whole different story).

C19: We will be living with C19 for the rest of humanity. It has become the norm. Yes, the cases are going up but the vaccines are keeping the deaths low. It will become common like the flu in the future.

Evergrande: The CCP will take care of it. Like they do with all their businesses and billionaires.

December 10th will likely be the most important day left in the year. When the last inflation numbers came out **(The highest in 31 Years)** the market shrugged it off as it were nothing. Sure there was some temporary uncertainty ... but the market quickly moved on after both retail spending numbers were reported and it became apparent that the Fed's tapering was lackluster at best. The question as to whether we can expect continuation or not will be on the back of every trader in Wall Street's mind, and I believe they've already started posturing for this now. Continuation in an increasing rate of inflation year over year will increase the likelihood, albeit this is not certain, that the Fed will make swifter changes to tapering, and perhaps bump up interest rates.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0v50v/mark_your_calendars_for_dec_10th_2021_and_expect/

1,"11/24/2021, 10:55:22",What does Palantir do?,kawake,"tl;dr -- Palantir has a one of a kind product but it doesn't solve my small pp issue. If you want a video that does a bad job of me describing this, here you go [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2k4ZBHydz4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2k4ZBHydz4)

Background on myself, currently I work as a backend engineer, doing data intensive projects. I exclusively work in AWS and use redshift, snowflake, AWS Glue, lambdas, etc. I'm also retarded, have no clue what I'm doing 100% of the time at work (bless the worker shortage) and have shit myself twice this year (not joking sadly). You have been warned.

So often, I see people saying ""I have no clue what Palantir does, the company is too much of black box, pp poopie."" And I get it, the company sucks at explaining what foundry and gotham do, so despite me being too dumb to work there (applied and got rejected instantly), I'll try and explain it.

Let's say we have a big industrial dairy company called ""Double D Milkshakes"". Double D Milkshakes has lots of large scale industrial farms. In addition, they have facilities that pasteurize the milk. After pasteurizing the milk and bottling it, they then have to transport it to various distributors across the country. 

This means, that Double D Milkshakes, is sitting on a fucking trove of data. They have data on each individual cow (what feed the cow is being given, how much milk it is producing, the breed, who its mommy and sperm donor daddy is). They also have an immense amount of data on the living conditions the cows are in (such as what temperature the pastures are kept in). Double D Milkshakes also has data on the facilities that pasteurize the milk (lot of sensor data that goes into this). They also  have all kinds of supply chain information and customer information trapped away in horrific ERM and salesforce systems (kill me please).

Now, every once in a while, some happy, unscarred monkey in management, goes ""Hey, if we can tap into all this data, we could make all kinds of optimizations, increase milk production, reduce cost and oo ee ee"".

So this monkey is granted funding, hires idiots like me who can't get jobs at real tech companies and tasks us with centralizing all this data into a data warehouse where the data scientist who are also lower tier can analyze the data and unlock all this value hidden in the data. Here is where it all falls apart. Moving all this data from the corporate farms into a data warehouse proves to be a difficult task. Setting up integration with sales force and all this other siloed data throughout the enterprise also proves to be a rather slow and difficult task. Not to mention, we don't really understand what any of the data means. Two years of your life go by and that gun under the bed starts talking to me every night, saying ""HEY duuddddeeee, don't you think I'd feel good against your template."" At the same time, half the team has left, the data scientists claim the data is unclean and ""does not make sense"". Worse, that happy, innocent, monkey of a manager that got funding for the project left to go work for Kum &amp; Go.

Here is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. They recognized this problem way back in the early 2000s and thought, ""geez, let's build an entire data platform so people don't have to do that."" So, low and behold, they built the operating system for data. 

Here is what Foundry does:

1. Foundry can be deployed at the ""edge"". This means at each individual farm and facility that Double D Milkshakes owns, they can deploy foundry to aggregate and collect the data at that location. In addition, workers at these locations can use Foundry to analyze the localized data themselves and make optimizations at the ""edge"". ""But how can these, hard working, illegal immigrants that don't know english do that? Don't you need to be a data scientist?"" Foundry does an excellent job visualizing data. Anyone with actual ambition (illegal immigrants and first gen americans) could figure it out.
2. With Foundry deployed at the edge, we can also deploy it at corporate and use all these out of the box integrations to integrate with the various databases, scattered throughout the company. They make it super, duper easy. In addition, all the foundry instances deployed at the edge will send the data they are collecting and analyzing to the main foundry instance
3. We can import business ontology to organize the data and actually make sense of it. All this really means, is data often sucks and makes no sense. Foundry allows us to describe what the data means in English and remembers for us. In addition, we can organize the data and foundry makes it easy to clean datasets and do a bunch of other data sciencey crap. The hard part is still figuring out what the data means at first but at least when half the development team leaves for better jobs, the data at that point has already been described and the knowledge will not be lost.
4. AI and Machine Learning made simple. Go out and try running machine learning algorithms on large datasets. Takes fucking effort. Foundry makes it so fucking simple that HR can do it.
5. Simulations. Probably the biggest fucking win in my book. Building a system to run simulations takes an immense amount of work. Foundry, makes it dead simple. So the workflow becomes this: We import all this data into foundry, describe and organize it. Foundry runs its big brain AI on the datasets and gives us insights, like ""hey dumbo, maybe if we change the feed from feed x to feed y we can increase milk production. I noticed this because one of the farms uses feed y and gets more milk out of those cow tittes."" We can then simulate what would happen if we changed all of our feed from grain x to y AND see if the cost benefit (because y is more expensive) is worth it.
6. A bunch of other shit like alerts, metrics, dashboards, applications can all be created in foundry. 

I've gone on to long. I do own Palantir at an average cost of $13.06/share. Bought some at IPO and more shortly after. Can't talk to why number goes down. That's for other monkeys to figure out but hopefully this sheeds light on what Palantir does.

Check out this pharmaceutical play. It has been beaten down the past few weeks after receiving an FDA approval. Here are some bullish reasons to consider investing:

1. another PDUFA on 1/29/22
2. expected to become profitable in 2022
3. they have 2 new products coming to market in 4Q21.
4. they are increasing their salesforce for their primary product in 4Q21
5. Eton now has six FDA-approved products, three of which (carglumic acid, EPRONTIA, and Rezipres) are expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company also has four additional products that have been submitted to the FDA and could be approved and launched in 2022.

20,000 cars delivered this year.

1,6$ billion in revenue this year.

Search ""Best Electric Vehicles"" on Google, these cars make the top 10 lists on most of the top results.

Low float, 80 million shares available to buy, in the future as many more newcomers buy the stock, with the limited shares available, good chance for it to explode pretty soon.

They have an award winning car design for their next upcoming model which looks like something Batman would drive.

Extremely low valuation compared to its peers. You're buying something cheaper than the high valuations of Lucid, Xpeng etc.

Sell me [this GGPI.](https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Wolf-of-Wall-Street-Pen-Scene.jpg)

Great CEO. Thomas Ingenlath, a german, worked at Audi, Volkswagen, Skoda &amp; had a high ranking job at Volvo at the top, before becoming Polestar's CEO. 

Merger vote is officially next quarter. GGPI will officially become Polestar. F-4 already got filed last week. Polestar's team have come out and said that they're ready for the merger, and things are moving at an extremely fast pace, and at this pace we shouldn't be surprised if the merger happens in January already.

The Institutions invested in GGPI: Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Saba Capital Management, Citadel(fucking Citadel), Credit Suisse &amp; Bank of America.

Conclusion: Global EV play with low valuation, over a billion dollars in revenue, already over 20,000 electric vehicles sold just this year, new car models are on the way, low float, extremely experienced CEO. And it's still early, the more people that notice this great investment, the more it will go up and the chance for it to explode becomes greater.

My thesis is simple. I believe that Activision Blizzard is massively undervalued right now, the Intellectual Property that they own is priceless at a time like this. The value investors on youtube fail to consider its Metaverse potential BTW.  


Quote from the wow forums:  ""WoW has had more money and development put into it than any existing Metaverse project on earth. ""  


Also, if you check out [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) you will notice that they have many fans for their games.  


Now in my personal opinion, the entire WSJ article was a hit piece meant to do one of the following: Drop share price so that they can scoop up cheap shares, or perhaps get rid of Bobby Kotick so that they can implant their own CEO and BOARD to take over the direction of this company, maybe even give away its IP for CHEAP... (Hey, I've seen certain governments use that strategy to rival countries before)  


So right now you have to ask yourself, does this company deserve to be priced at 60 bucks a share? 48 billion market cap? Simply because of sexual misconduct in the workplace? Woke much? This happens at every workplace...Happened at Tesla recently, but got swept under the rug? WHY IS THERE SO MUCH HATE FOR BLIZZARD AND KOTICK??? it seems irrational to me. I bought the dip.

I have waited this kind of chance for a while, and decided to go long on turkey. So today I went to my local mall and bought 100 (one hundred) full turkeys. They are all about 5-6 kilogram best in quality, homegrown, and fucking beautiful turkeys . These bad boys are loaded in my brand new, best in class freezers which i picked up on my way home. Cant wait to tell wife! 

I think this is brilliant bet, even if i say it my self. Turkey keep crashing (down -11% today or somthg idk) and i am going to make a fortune. Turkey-to-usd keeps going down and then when the time is right i will sell my turkeys for bigger price. Easy money i would say. 
Going to hold these mf birds with my diamond hands! 

But, there is a one thing that i didnt think about. Turkey expiration day. How long does turkey last on freezer before it goes bad?  Google says that Turkeys can be kept in the freezer indefinitely. However, cook turkeys within 1 year for the best quality. Does this affect my investiment?

 If you watch YouTube a lot there is no way you haven't seen this company sponsor one of your favorite YouTubers. The thing I like the most is the fact that the YouTubers I love the most are the honest ones. And they choose to work with manscaped.

Today news announced that they will merge via spac to be listed and traded. 

Reasons I am excited? 
1.I got in with 10 shares at 10 bucks each on the first day.

2.they have a very niche product but have won the trust of customers and start expanding their range of products

3. They 10x their revenue in less then 5 years

5. They spend 30% of that on marketing

6. My brother who is an online marketer says they have great marketing

7.A credible Instagram page announced their merger and there is only one YouTube video done so we're early

8. 75% of customers have a monthly subscription

 Prediction...price will explode as soon as YouTube investors start picking it up.

Then, a month later he dumps $42 million worth of his shares right after the stock had already fallen by about 25%. Basically making it look like he had no faith in his own company after his wild and outlandish claims.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* The technology sector continued losses as rising government yields dampened the outlook for growth equities, while US shares rallied on the back of advances in cyclicals.
* After bouncing between gains and losses in the last hour of trading, the S&amp;P 500 finished the day higher. The rise was led by energy and financial stocks. 
* The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell, adding to Monday's late-night selloff. The treasury yield curve steepened, with the 10-year yield approaching a one-month high. 
* Turkey's currency crisis worsened, with the lira falling below 13 per US dollar. Zoom fell as growth appeared to be halting.
* Traders reduced their bets on the Federal Reserve remaining dovish for a longer period of time after Jerome Powell was selected to a second term. In his policy approach, the chair aimed to strike a compromise, stating that the central bank will utilise all measures at its disposal to help the economy while also preventing inflation from becoming entrenched.
* Despite recent dips, US stocks have been trading at all-time highs, raising concerns about valuations as investors weigh growth prospects in the face of rising inflation and a lingering pandemic.
* Since September 2020, the dollar has traded at its greatest level. For the first time since 2017, the Japanese yen surpassed 115 per dollar.
* Fed's Bostic on Monday that the US central bank may need to accelerate the elimination of monetary stimulus and allow for an earlier-than-planned increase in interest rates.
* Turkey's lira fell the most in the world, reaching a new low, after President  Erdogan defended his pursuit of lower interest rates to support economic growth and job creation. His unconventional stance that rising interest rates feed inflation has caused the currency to fall for nine years in a row, resulting in a 43% drop in 2021 alone.
* Zoom video fell as analysts, notably Citigroup Inc., expressed concern about sluggish incremental growth and the lowest new-customer additions in three years. The stock of Urban Outfitters is down 9.4% as a result of supply-chain problems and cost pressures in the third quarter.
* Oil rose after an unprecedented plan by consumption countries to use their strategic oil reserves proved less severe than investors had anticipated. While the headline magnitude of the US release is considerable, a major portion of the crude will be borrowed and returned later, leaving traders expecting tighter balances in the future. In collaboration with China, Japan, India, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, the United States will release 50 million barrels of crude from its strategic reserves.

""According to the*Wall Street Journal*, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating claims that Cassava Sciences manipulated research results of the companys proposed Alzheimers drug, Simufilam.""

Regarding the recent allegations, Marina R. Picciotto, a Yale School of Medicine professor and editor-in-chief of the *Journal of Neuroscience*, confirmed that the journal had found no proof of data manipulation in Cassavas research papers.   


**Phase 3 Study:**  
Cassava Sciences Initiated a Second Phase 3 Study of Simufilam for the Treatment of Patients with Alzheimers Disease. 

Phase 3 primary endpoint is COGNITION. Solid phase 2 results on that, and no you can't fake the results across 16 sites.   


**Short Float:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There is NO WAY the shorts have covered considering the share price is the same as it was one week ago prior to the short, there is an aggressive buyback ongoing, and retail enthusiasm is through the roof ($UWMC trended on another site two days in a row).

1,"11/24/2021, 06:04:33",Indicators and Metrices for begginers,KaviB_real,"# Moving Averages (MA)

The Moving average (MA) is one of the most straightforward tools used in Technical Analysis (TA). The moving average is the average price over a time period, we often use the 200 days moving average, 50 days moving average, and the 20 days moving average. It can be used for any timeframe.

MAs with a shorter timeframe react much faster to price changes. There are also different kinds of Moving Averages used, for example, the SMA (simple moving average) or the EMA (exponential moving average). They differentiate in they behave a little bit. Since this is an introduction, I will not go into further detail here.



# The 200-Day (simple) Moving Average (SMA)

The 200 SMA represents the average price over the past 200 days. It is mainly used to spot up- and downtrends and also identify support and resistance areas.


As a rule of thumb, if the price is above the 200 MA, the trend is up; if it's below, the trend is down.

# The 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)

This moving average is also very popular under technical traders. It is considered the first line of support in uptrend markets and the first line of resistance if the markets are going down.

You may have stumbled across two important terms above: the Death Cross and the Golden Cross. In both turns of trend events, the 200 SMA and the 50 SMA are involved.

A so-called Death Cross happens if 50 SMA is crossing the 200 SMA from up to down. This is often seen that a bear market is coming up. On the other hand, the Golden Cross is when the 50 SMA crosses the 200 SMA from down to up, good times are supposed to happen.

# The 20-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The shorter the timeframe, the faster the Moving Averages are reacting to the price changes in the market. With a shorter period, like the average price of 20 days, you can spot changes in trends faster, but it is also more likely that you get a false alarm because of a bit of breakout.

Moving averages are popular within Traders and often used with other key indicators for both, exits and entries. Do not forget you can not predict the future from the past, but you can draw some lines in the sand, get some grip, and better understand price developments.

Next will have a look at the relative strength index indicator, which is a momentum indicator.

# Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI indicates if a digital asset is overbought or oversold. The Relative Strength Index indicates bullish or bearish price momentum; usually, if the RSI is about 70 %, that means a cryptocurrency is overbought. If the Index is under 30 %, it is oversold. The RSI measures the magnitude of a recent change in the price within a period of time (usually 14 days, 14 hours, etc.). The data are shown on an oscillator between 0 and 100.

Generally speaking, when the RSI goes below the 70 % level, this can be seen as a bearish signal; on the other hand, if it climbs above 30 %, this can be seen as a bullish sign. A momentum indicator like the RSI can give an idea if buyers have the market under control or sellers might take over.

Like all other indicators and financial metrics, the signals can be misleading, so it is best not to use them as a direct sell and buy signals.

# Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator. It subtracts the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA and measures the relationship between two EMA's.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence is made up of two lines. There is the MACD line and the signal line. Most charting tools (e.g., Tradingview ) also show a histogram showing the distance between the signal and the MACD line.

Traders can get an insight into the strength of the current trend by looking at the MACD chart.

For example, if the price chart shows higher highs, but the MACD shows lower highs, there is a higher probability that the markets could start going down soon. The price is increasing while the momentum is decreasing.

Momentum isthe speed or velocity of an Asset's price change

Both MACD and RSI are used together since both, measure the momentum, but by different factors.

# Bollinger Bands (BB)

Bollinger Bands measure the volatility of the markets and also if the market is overbought and oversold.

BBs consist of three lines:

the middle Band - simple moving average. The standard is usually the 20 SMA

the upper Band (usually two standard deviations from the middle Band)

the lower Band (usually two standard deviations from the middle Band)

A standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean.

With the increase in volatility, the distance between bands increases. Smaller volatility is shown with a smaller distance. The closer the price is to the upper Band in general, the more overbought the price; the closer to the lower Band, we are in an oversold market. A breakout of the Band shows extreme market conditions",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0okpa/indicators_and_metrices_for_begginers/

Let me clear that everything here is to help and not for profit. I do run an educational platform but it's all free and I won't link it to follow rules- just wanted to be transparent. I used to be TD broker and when you all used to call me, I would slam my head into the desk 500 times to make the pain stop. So, let me give you some real guidance cause I want people to improve. I'm now self-employed, you can check me out on Twitter @ NoBellTrading. And read disclosures; this is all educational content in nature. Historical performance is not indicative of future performance. This post is not a recommendation and all content is my opinion and not representative of any of my affiliates.

Anyways, time to nerd out and get to the content.   
**How to play earnings.** *With options of course.* I got 1000% returns on ATVI recently and shared it online and people freaked. I made an entire YouTube to teach the basics; [https://youtu.be/vZqfa56VacA](https://youtu.be/vZqfa56VacA) But since it's like 120 tik toks long and I know I'm already pushing your attention span- I also put together a TL:DR for everyone;  
\-back test for average percentage movement on the stock, you need a big move (right now with frothy market and high amount of retail traders, this is especially easy cause most newbies are delusional and think fundamentals don't matter.)  
\-Only play companies you actually follow. I have nearly a decade of experience in this game. There is probably 15-20 companies that I know extensively. Management team, partnerships, products, vision, etc. Notes and research out the ass. This means I'm never blind throwing darts.

\-stop buying weeklies, go further out and play trend. Monthly or longer  
\-Stop getting stiff armed by vega (implied IV) and go far out the money  
\-risk is CAPITAL EXPOSURE, spend what you are willing to LOSE not what you want to MAKE.   
\-Gambling is the word used for ER plays. Statistics is the word I prefer. If I make 10 trades (same $ spent for each) and somehow still lose 7- but get one or two 1000% -&gt; I'm still up. I can only lose 1000%.   
\-This is not my main strategy for making money. The point is to understand that the common saying of ""never play earnings"" is just nonsensical. You just need to know what you are doing.   


In my experience this stuff is like surfing. Someone can tell you all day the factual info on how to do this or that, but until you are riding the waves on your own, you will be lost.

Electric car sales have been growing but the vast majority of cars and trucks still remain gas powered. The main economic problem that companies face with EVs is the cost of the battery and sub-par performance in comparison to gas cars. Many car companies have committed to switching over to EVs and some are even abandoning combustible engines all together, such as Tesla. There is a large consolidation in the battery space with most of the biggest players belonging to foreign markets such as Korea, China and Japan. Quantumscape is an American startup with backing from Bill Gates and Volkswagen group. 

Quantumscape utilizes new solid state lithium anode batteries to outcompete standard batteries.  They do this in a variety of ways including cost of inputs, energy density, charging time, and battery cycles. There are 3 important values that batteries in today's market need to be competitive: Charge time, energy density, and number of battery cycles (or length of battery life). 

Solid state batteries last for more charge cycles and offer a higher energy density than traditional car batteries, this is possible because of QSs advancement in lithium anode batteries. Lithium anode batteries require less rare earth metals such as cobalt and lithium because these batteries completely lack cathodes (which is achievable with a solid as an electrolyte). Additionally, SSBs are much faster charging compared to lithium-ion batteries, charging to 80% in just 15 minutes. All of these factors are critically important in engineering a more economically and commercially viable battery for mass consumer adoption.

https://preview.redd.it/ctbpqtgiqe181.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d43d4d710a28519581488300fced0d33d8f2174

Lithium ion batteries are passable in energy density and battery cycles but currently lack a way to charge really fast, making charge times take hours. The Quantumscape engineers see that one major bottleneck for all of these features is in the layout of lithium-ion batteries. Solid state batteries are their solution to these bottlenecks. To achieve this feat QS must learn how to mass produce both the solid electrolyte and solid state batteries inside of one giga-factory.

Quantumscape has been developing its first high-volume automated factory called QS-0. This makes Quantumscape inch ever closer to commercialization of their products including the 10-layer cell. Future growth in demand for batteries makes now the best time for suppliers to develop their infrastructure to increase output.

https://preview.redd.it/fzadkeujqe181.png?width=1191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f9b92b5d012e71f0bb96dafd37a881918b80727

Quantumscape has a large cash cushion and a rather small operating budget. Cash operating expenses are about $130 million to $160 million with around $1.3 billion in liquidity. The $1.3 billion is expected to carry the company through QS-1 initial production and expansion. This is a hit or miss scenario, the $1.3 billion could last them all the way past their initial factory or until QS commercializes their products by 2024. Short term cash flow could come from selling stock and watering down holders shares to cover QS-2 if they dont have strong sales. 

The race of Solid-state batteries has been going on for years between multiple companies. The main problem is the solid electrolyte separator; many different designs over the years have been proposed yet failed. A solid electrolyte needs to account for three factors: conductivity of lithium ions (think fast charge), corrosion (of battery dendrites) , and the chemical and electrochemical stability of lithium metal. These three necessities have stumped the best chemists looking to create a solid battery. QS is still early in the development of their factory output and product. This is a risky company in our portfolio, they have a time limit to becoming a viable company with marketable batteries. As of right now Qs has the best likelihood of progressing the technology of solid-state batteries. QS batteries are just a prototype currently, but their prototype has 36% more capacity and charges twice as fast as leading EV batteries, like teslas. 

QS has huge potential. It seems likely they will take a huge bit out of the $300 billion battery market. Their technology scales down in size very well, in fact the tests they are conducting are on batteries small enough to fit in a phone. We've personally made great returns on this name, over 50%, and think it has a lot of room to run. If they can pull everything off, they have a strictly better battery with 36% more capacity, charging that is twice as fast, and a longer effective life than the current leading batteries. Revenue for this company could be as high as $100 billion/ year in 1- years. This position is high risk, high reward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0myjm/quantumscape_dd/

Ok, so you might remember the days when both UPST and NET only seemed to go up (Pepperidge Farm remembers). Well, here's a chart showing the on balance volume (OBV) for each ticker.

&amp;#x200B;

[UPST](https://preview.redd.it/4ym2vy9lme181.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a0b57b14938fc97b103dd5dc89b4bc4bad8b4a1)

You probably dont even know what youre looking at, so let me explain.

When UPST drilled, its on balance volume drilled, too. Three out of three times if you can count the arrows. It tells me that people ran for the exits.

&amp;#x200B;

[NET](https://preview.redd.it/2zvffusume181.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54a0d59ac180962659774fe975bbd8909e2a4655)

&amp;#x200B;

Now take a look at NET. Her stock price jumped off a cliff like a love-torn lover but her on balance volume barely moved.  This tells me people are taking profits, but not trampling each other to get out.

&amp;#x200B;

[Hi! Im NET because my hair color is the color of my logo.](https://i.redd.it/hvskx5xxme181.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

**20-day SMA**

Next, let's dive into this 6M 1D chart to realize NET rarely visits the south side of her 20-day moving average.

&amp;#x200B;

[NET 20-day SMA](https://preview.redd.it/wvcbdvm3ne181.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57dd1a866d710741fa9f59f511d4303b94914c6f)

&amp;#x200B;

[Visiting the ugly side of the 20-SMA.](https://i.redd.it/z5zmjkv7ne181.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

But when she does go below that line, she comes right back to her comfy upscale side of her 20-SMA and goes on a bull run. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Keltner channels**

Moving on to the next chartsame time frame with Keltner channels, where you can see she's currently holding her ground on top of the lower band (181.25).

&amp;#x200B;

[Keltner channels](https://preview.redd.it/nfh9ba9ine181.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc1712d0216b678d281b9a9d3d6ff268400ef8b4)

Why is this important? Because this band might show her what's off-limits and keep her from straying deeper down.  

&amp;#x200B;

[I'm not going there!](https://i.redd.it/bkolsl1lne181.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why did it drill, then?**

The stock took a dive because of yesterday newsthat NETs CEO (Matthew Prince) *exercised options to purchase 109,487 Cloudflare shares for $0 on November 18. They then sold their shares on succeeding transactions in the open market. They sold at prices ranging from ($0.00) to $221.32 to raise a total of $22,364,228 from the stock sale.*

And it was especially bearish since *as a result of this transaction, Prince has fully liquidated their stake in the company.*

Whoa! Thats pretty bad, right? The CEO liquidates his whole stake in the company hes running? Oof. 

**But wait...**

However, although he did exercise some options and bought shares, it is **NOT** true that he liquidated his whole stake. Fake news. Apparently, he only sold 0.5% of his holdings.

Hopefully, someone will be able to share SEC filing links to calculate the actual percentage that he sold, but it is not 100%.

**Positions**

Either way, I bought several Dec 17 $220C and averaged down during the morning dip (2.20 - 2.50). Right now, Im at a -3.14% unrealized loss, with what I expect will be much greener days ahead.

: Granted, $220 might be too much to ask her, and you may want to look for an expiration further down the lane. This is not financial advice.

FINRA requires firms to report short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities twice a month. In an effort to capture this data, Seeking Alphas quant model's algo is updated daily, ensuring we do not miss when the short interest data is reported. Updating our model daily also ensures that all of the quant data is near real-time.

Again, short interest has not worked as a consistent strategy in past decades, but it has worked for the last 18 months. If you like short interest and want to make it work, consider using our Top Short Squeeze Stock screen.

1,"11/24/2021, 04:01:18",Get Enriched with Uranium,no_more_Paw_patrol,"You should get bullish on Uranium, the juices are flowing for a nice move in the next month or 3.

My [positions](https://imgur.com/a/nibBedJ) I've been in since late august early Sept.

Most of what I summarize was learned from Uranium twitter quality follows are:

quakes99, uraniuminsider, thealexW, numerco it is a small community once you get into one you'll find the others.

The short version for those with moth like attention spans:

First point, the TOTAL U market cap is less than 50B, yes Papa musk can buy the entire industry a few times over.

SPUT - the sprott physical Uranium trust, TSX:U.UN, U.U, OTC: SRUUF (NYSE listing is soon) is buying U from the spot market. There isn't that much U on the spot market, the industry has been in a production deficit for the last few years as stockpiles from suspended reactors, warheads, have been used. SPUT has come online in the last few months and the spot price has doubled. Last night they announced they can raise enough cash to buy half the global production this year. Supply and demand is a thing, we can use the ""s"" word here if you like.

Easy plays: Get into SPUT for a safe 2x-3x over the next few months. More leverage with:   CCJ, DNN, 4U (market cap 1.4B so I won't put the full ticker). Some ETFs with options on the NYSE, not sure of market cap so I will not post tickers, both are over 1B.

There are lots of junior miners in the space, juniors could be more torque or they could be black holes for your money. Stick with the guys who can produce.

\*Long Version\*

 The background

There  isn't enough uranium getting mined and reactors have been running on  stockpiled stuff. Why was there a stockpile? Reactors getting shutdown  early for politics, meltdown worries, whatever. Ze Germans, Japanese,  and a few others shut a bunch of theirs down with the Fukushima incident  in 2011. There was also some decommissioned weapons stockpiles to get  through. A break-even/profitable price for U should be $60/lb. Since  2013, the price has been mostly in the 30s, with lows in the teens.  Mines have been shut or furloughed in response to the shitty prices.  Everybody in the industry knows a few things:

1. Everyone is using stockpiled stuff right now
2. Current production cannot meet the current operational reactors needs
3. It takes 12-18 months for mines to restart

The game is afoot.

Now,  Sprott, a fairly well established commodities trader in Canada had the  bright idea to start a physical trust for Uranium and to take physical  delivery. Learn about [SPUT here.](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/) Much the same way as someone would buy gold, debeers would buy  diamonds to lock away, or some crytpo chad with a monkey NFT. This is  the birth of SPUT. Essentially, they created a fund so that retail investors can buy Uranium, as everyone knows that the utilities  are using more than is being produced. SPUT started this summer buying  U. Sprott also has equity in U miners and they are also about to take  over a U ETF on the NYSE. So SPUT is buying up the stockpile, which in turn  will force the price of U up, which then will cause the miners to go to  the moon. I want to be clear about this one, SPUT has no mechanism to  sell U, this is a one way street. They buy U it is gone forever from the  spot market. They use the word ""sequestered"".

SPUT raises money  with an ATM, which is different from the thing you do behind wendy's, at the market offering. So  they issue shares at market prices to raise money, which they then use  to buy U. They are just short of 2B in assets. They have so far  purchased \~21M/lbs, global production is 56.2k Tonnes or \~120M/lbs. Of  note, 120M/lbs is only enough for [74% of current global demand](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx). The re-upped the ATM last night to just over 3B in total, which is enough cash to buy 50% of global production at current market prices.

So  there isn't enough U, everyone knows it, and now someone has come along  and gobbled up \~20% of the global supply in 3 months. Supply and demand  is a bit of a thing. Now, nobody knows how big the stockpile is, there  could just be ""not enough"" all of a sudden or we could be doing this  buying business for a bit. the ""U twitter"" world are all pretty  convinced the stockpiles are running out as we have seen a pretty sharp  move in the spot price since SPUT started to buy.

The bad news.

The  TOTAL Uranium market is fucking small, \~45 Billion, pick your fav EV company that doesn't make anything and it is bigger. The two big producers are CCJ and  KAP ~~khazak~~ ~~khazkstan~~ Borat world, both are  \~11-12B, so, major institutional investors are not really ""in"". Also,  the current set of investors are a bunch of weirdos who have been  getting shit-kicked for the last 10 years. So they are a bit  jumpy, combined with the fucking small market cap this is ""volatile"".  Just look at the last 5 trading days. Finally, nobody knows how much stockpiled U there is, the industry is a  meltdown away from  getting shit kicked again for another 10 years.

The good news.

The  last time U took off it went north of $100/lb, 2007. Utilities can  afford that price, 1 ton of U =  16k ton of coal or 80k BOE. The idea  that carbon free can't be achieved with solar and wind alone is gaining  traction. Lots of positive news about reactors going to get built in  China, India, US reactors staying online, others restarting. This thing  could have a real fun overshoot in price, there is literally not enough  Uranium coming out of the ground.

The plays

I am avoiding the small junior miners.

The safe play is just to buy SPUT, and then enjoy the 2x, 3x from here.

More torque can be had buying the miners which are a multiple of the spot price. Then doing calls on the miners for extra torque

CCJ and KAP have limited upside to a big price run up as they supply on longer term contracts

I  have a bunch in 4U &amp; DNN. My DNN calls  are getting IV fucked as I got them on the first pop in the summer/fall. I  averaged down with the 4U calls.

I  spread some money around to play the field, I have taken profits on CCJ  calls, probably won't buy them again. I am looking for a 2x - 10x on my  current book cost. I don't think this is unreasonable. [Here is a decent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/pmq9ld/uranium_rana1965s_multiplier_and_quakes99s/) that give a break down on expected movement to a given spot price.

A good theta gang play is to sell some calls on this stuff, especially if you think this thing will take a bit longer to move.

This  stuff is so volatile that there is lots of opportunity for getting in  and taking profits. 

Look on twitter and you'll find lists all sorts of [lists](https://twitter.com/stokdog/status/1459644178346901507?s=20).

There is not much in the way of options, currently these get beaten down just before the mid-month expiry. 

Also, the spot price usually gets beaten down just before month end, this one is important, as this time SPUT has the cash to defend the bid and it also re-upped the ATM so we should see a much higher low at month end, setting up for a much nicer spring board into December.

**PART 1: Intro**

Hello my fellow WSB friends. Looks like the market has been doing great this week lol. But of course, none of you are capable of making money on your own. So here I am to share

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jq257h3wfe181.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ff0e922f2892aaf8c810cb5110582bb44d014c

**PART 2: The Company**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img jkrfnhd2ge181...*

Sooo What is GGPI? They are a SPAC known as Gores-Guggenheim Inc., backed by Gores Group and Guggenheim Partners. GGPI is bringing Polestar public, which is a Swedish electric vehicle company that has ACTUAL REVENUE from vehicle sales worldwide! They have delivered well over 20,000 vehicles so far, and they are projected to have a revenue of $1.6B this year.

Here you can see some sales data from Europe, not included are the sales in China and North America:

&amp;#x200B;

[Polestar Car Sales \(Wow they sell actual cars, Unbelievable isn't it?!\)](https://preview.redd.it/jdy9gcj3ge181.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72d1327341d1697a64248c215d628c9a74557ee2)

&amp;#x200B;

[Polestar Revenue \(Holy shit they make money unlike other EV!\)](https://preview.redd.it/w61k2zg5ge181.png?width=1176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99f157fa650c77eff51f56c144828a7dca10e8d)

The table shows the numbers in million SEK, **Polestar did $636 million USD in revenue in 2020 which is slated to grow by 151% in 2021 to $1.6B**. Thats BEFORE the release of the Polestar 3, their new SUV which will be made in the USA in Ridgeville, NC, as well as their 4th model which is the Polestar Precept. It is a full-size electric sedan comparable to an S-Class or the Lucid Air in size. If you dont get any Bladerunner vibes from it, please ask your wife's boyfriend to watch that movie with you.

**PART 3: THE SPONSORS**

Guggenheim Partners is a massive investment bank with over $250B AUM. They are well-known within the industry with a great reputation. Ever heard of the Guggenheim Museum for modern art in New York? They belong to the big boys club.

The Gores Group is a highly prolific and successful SPAC sponsor. Theyve created a pipeline of SPACs with an amazing hit rate. They have an average 28.2% average and 20.9% medium return on their SPACs.

Oh yeah just to mention: GGPI is by far the biggest SPAC in terms of trust size backed by Gores Group. Great things are about to happen.

**PART 4: THE BIG BOYS (Institution Holdings) &amp; (Leadership)**

**(Thank you** [u/Zooomr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Zooomr/) **for the info)**

**We have to mention this guy, Leonardo Dicaprio, the person that we all know is investing in Polestar!**

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the big players in GGPI that weve all heard of are:

TD Asset Management - 500,000 shares

Deutsche Bank - 608,174 shares

Goldman Sachs - 50,000 shares

UBS - 1,000,000 shares

Weiss Asset Management - 750,000 shares

Saba Capital Management - 2,399,090 shares

Citadel - 2,751,557 shares

Credit Suisse - 60,000 shares

Millennium Management - 1,385,634 shares

D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. - 416,666 shares

Bank of America - 150,000 shares

In terms of ownership, Here's who we've got and who they are affiliated with

* Alec Gores / Gores Group
* Mark Stone / Gores Group
* **Andrew M. Rosenfield / Guggenheim Partners President**
* Andrew McBride / Gores Group
* Randall Bort / Gores Group
* **Elizabeth Marcellino / Additional board member, who brings unique expertise**
* **Nancy Tellem / Additional board member, who brings unique expertise**

**Why did I highlight the people above?**

They are the ""interesting faces that bring additional expertise above and beyond what we usually see in a Gores space. So just who are these people? I will copy and paste info from the S1 to answer that.

**Andrew M. Rosenfeld**

* Mr. Rosenfield is the **President of Guggenheim Partners**,
* He is responsible for many aspects of firm management and strategic planning and leads the firms principal transactions. Mr. Rosenfield is also a Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School, whose faculty he joined in 1986. From 2010 through 2018, while remaining a Managing Partner at Guggenheim Partners,
* Mr. Rosenfield was the founder and Chief Executive Officer of TGG Group, a behavioral economics consulting firm.
* From 1977 until 2001, Mr. Rosenfield was the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Lexecon Inc. (now known as Compass Lexecon), a leading law and economics consulting firm.
* From 1999 until its sale in 2004, Mr. Rosenfield was the founder and Chief Executive Officer of UNext Inc., an early online education business that partnered with Columbia University, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, Carnegie Mellon University, and the London School of Economics.

Bottom line, impressive resume. Hes the President of Guggenheim Partners, and he's on the board of this SPAC. That carries weight in terms of both raising capital for a PIPE, and also the quality of potential targets.

**Nancy Tellem**

* Ms. Tellem is the Executive Chairperson of Eko, a media network that reimagines storytelling by using proprietary technology to create interactive stories that respond and leverage the interactive nature of todays media devices
* In addition, **as a board member of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Holdings Inc.** (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) **since** **2013**, Nancy expanded her role from January through July 2019, becoming Executive Director to the Office of the CEO to help develop the overall long-term strategy for the company.
* Until October of 2014, Ms. Tellem was President of Xbox Entertainment Studios where she oversaw Microsofts TV strategy and created a studio focused on the development and production of interactive programming.
* From 1997 to 2012, Ms. Tellem was **President of the CBS Network Television Entertainment Group**. She oversaw both CBS Entertainment Network and CBS Studios.
* Before CBS, Ms. Tellem was the **Executive Vice President of Business and Financial Affairs for Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.** where she shepherded in such hits as ER and Friends.
* Ms. Marcellino has also served as a member of the board of directors of Gores Holding VI since June 2020 and will continue to do so until the pending completion of the Matterport acquisition

**PART 5: Fundamentals**

Gores has a great SPAC track record

* $38 billion of transaction value across eight completed/announced transactions
* $6 billion of new cash equity delivered across eight completed/announced transaction
* 13 SPACs raised to date, totaling $5.7 billion (prior to PIPE commitments)

This is a great opportunity to get in early / lots of upside for shareholders

* Polestar shareholders compelling valuation and upside potential from rollover shares and earnout
* New investors get an attractive entry with long-term return potential

One thing about GGPI/Polestar is that this is something you can hold forever unlike those SHORT SQUEEZE TO THE MOON SPACs that are absolutely worthless and die after the squeeze. You can see the redemption rate for Gore SPACs below

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 6: SOME COMMON QUESTIONS REGARDING GGPI/POLESTAR**

* Why would Polestar go public with a SPAC rather than a traditional IPO?

The reason for this is because a SPAC deal allows Polestar to benefit from the support, experience, resources, and expertise of the Gores Guggenheim team, being backed by a great sponsor means a better future for Polestar

* Why did Polestar decide to become a public company now?

Polestar believes going public right now would accelerate their strategy and they expect rapid growth in the near future, some of their plans include:

1. Launch 3 new cars by year-end 2024
2. Build sales to approximately 290,000 cars per year-end 2025
3. Expand global distribution footprint to 30 markets by year-end 2023
4. Execute on sustainability commitment with the target of creating a truly climate-neutral car by year-end 2030 and being the MOST TRANSPARENT PURE EV COMPANY

* Since 49.5% of Polestar is owned by Volvo, a Chinese company, would it be accurate to describe Polestar as a Chinese company?

The answer is simply No. Polestar is a Swedish premium electric performance car brand that is headquartered in Sweden with a global presence. While the Chinese market is important for polestar, their main growth focus is in the market in Europe and North America. Polestars holding company will be in the UK and they will be listed on the Nasdaq in the United States backed by top-tier institutional investors.

Polestar has made great progress separating Polestar brand from Volvo car over the past four years, their relationship is conducted on an arms-length basis

**PART 7: PRICE TARGET**

Oh yeah my favorite part of writing a DD!

Heres the price target:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/epsswp6fge181.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3acb385d20734252839581ce1481a7312105dec

Being an EV SPAC with actual existing vehicle production and revenue, I believe GGPI/Polestar will at least hit $20 once it gets more attention. We were able to get 32M in trading volume on the first day after the deal announcement. Combine that with the 50M combined volume since the merger rumor and its safe to say that most of the arbs are already out of GGPI and we could shoot straight up.

There are also a ton of open interest for GGPI dec/jan calls. Keep in mind, for every calls you buy from the hedgies, they have to buy shares to achieve delta-natural, so the more they buy the higher the stock price goes, this is gamma squeeze baby. TO THE MOON!!!

**PART 8: POSITION &amp; DISCLOSURES:**

I have 1500 warrants

Holding until we are at the moon

Disclosure: I am not a financial advisor, please do your own due diligence before investing.

TLDR: Buy GGPI/Polestar, the next tesla!!

**A poem for our beloved Gores:**

Our papa gores

Who art in the Beverly hill

Hallowed be thy wallet

Thy merger come

Thy DA be done

On mainstreet as it is on wallstreet

Give us our daily tendies

And forgive us our paper hands

As we forgive those who paperhand unto us

And lead us not into bankruptcy

But deliver us from poverty

For our money

Our worship

Our asses

Are yours

Now and Forever

Amen",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0lk15/ggpi_the_next_tesla_perfect_gamma_squeeze/

They have a lithium mine (right by Tetsla factory in Nevada) and solar patents on a system that creates thousands of gallons of water per hour out of thin air from solar panels ""Enertopia Rainmaker"" and heat extraction patents ""Enertopia Heat Extractor"" for use on solar arrays to eliminate excess heat from the panels thereby increasing electric output and the lifetime of the panel. It's only 5 cents. The Department of Energy just gave them research funding. The DOE doesn't play when it comes to who they just give free money to. The DOE does extensive research into who to give funding to. I think this is being kept a little hush-hush because this is futuristic technology and a very small stock- for now. 

What makes me believe in this company is their research. 3 patents and DOE approval. Additionally, the US is investing heavly in clean energy. Plus, lithium is the primary source of EV battery which is growing. And finally, it's only  5 ish cents a share

Stop wasting your money investing in imaginary shit coins that pump and numb ur entire college fund and invest in a cheap lithium and solar titan in the works.

1,"11/24/2021, 02:48:36",Tickle Me $SIMO - Mega Memory Upside,BigDaddyDLo,"&gt;SIMO starts with S and S looks like $. Coincidence? Not in this market! - Gandhi, 1901

# KEY POINTS

* SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory
* Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside when cycles exit troughs (\*we are here)
* MU makes up 24% of revenues, followed by other semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy
* Consensus Price Target: $98, but read thesis, these are significantly low
* Cheap Options = Falcon9 Blastoff Returns

# Company Description (ELI50 for Boomers)

Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power datacenters, mobile devices, SSDs, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMOs products.

# Bull/Only Thesis

This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).

What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good.

More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand which has proved resilient despite memory market prices and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no.

In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher. 

Luckily, Needham modeled this for us:

https://preview.redd.it/bo05eem52e181.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f1607d0a927283069d1c24f6a53299596fca75

Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.

# Valuation &amp; Financials

* Current Fwd P/E: 11.6
   * Past cycles have reached Fwd P/Es of 15-20+, insinuating 50-100% upside from current levels? Wrong. Every cycle works like this: Cycle in Trough? EPS gets cut. Cycle reaccelerates? Analysts start falling over themselves to raise estimates. You get multiple expansion on top of higher estimates. *(See CHART 1 &amp; 2)*. Did I mention SIMO never actually had estimates cut, unlike its customers?
* Sales Growth: 70% 21, 15% 22? No
   * Estimates currently model for only $1.06B in 2022, a 15% increase over 2021. On their last call, management stated a $1.5B backlog while also successfully securing more foundry space at TSMC. SIMO has pricing power and can continue to pass on any costs to keep margins fat as they have for years.
* EPS Growth 21: On track for 87%
   * This is despite constraints in their memory &amp; storage end market. As these manufacturing constraints are easing, SIMOs sales &amp; EPS should finally rocket higher into 2022 (more chips produced = more revenue for SIMO). 
* EPS Growth 22: Currently 19%
   * These are flat out wrong, as analysts have not revised models to account for the $1.5B sales backlog. With memory now exiting a cyclical trough, these figures will be revised higher, especially as analysts start to chase memory stock momentum.
* EV/EBITDA 22: 7.37
   * Enterprise Value (backs out cash) presents an even better picture than Fwd P/E. 
* Indicated Dividend: 2.8% 
   * Well above the S&amp;P 500 (1.2%) and the 10yr treasury after a recent 40% hike, perfectly price for retiree boomer WSBers, too.

# Technical Setup

SIMO has been consolidating along a rising 150DMA since October. The 20DMA converged with the 150DMA, and is starting to liftoff.

If you exclude the Q3 failed breakout thanks to the blink-and-you-missed-it Q4 cyclical downturn, SIMO has basically been a steady climber all of 2021. Relative strength has been rising recently as funds inevitably start their re-entry. Funds dont appreciate the power and swiftness of todays markets, and will chase this as it starts shooting up.

**SIMO consistently goes HAM in Decembers, so back up the trucks ahead of the Santa Claus rally.**

# How to Play

*Very Risk Averse*: March 22 80 Calls. Current Bid/Ask 2.15/3.00, presenting 5-6x returns on a rebound to $80 and 25% breakout to $100.

*Quasi-risk Averse*: Jan 22 80 calls. Current Bid/Ask 1.2/1.4, presenting 14-16.5x returns on a rebound to $80 and 25% breakout to $100.

*Pump It Up*: Dec 70 calls. Current Bid/Ask 0.75/1.00, presenting 15-20x returns if strong flows cause a breakout to $90 as funds return to memory stocks after a 2-3mo distribution period and ahead of MU earnings confirming that everything is blasting off.

*WSB Delight*: Dec 80 calls. Current Bid/Ask 0.3/0.55, presenting 18-33x returns if the same scenario plays out.

Some companies have posted their Q3 reports, which caused lots of social activity around the tickers. It's a nice indicator for making the investments - the more positive/negative social discussions around the company's ticker - the more chances to see the change in its stock.

Today's top will consist of 3 companies that have had most of the social hype over the last week:

**1. Aligos Therapeutics Inc. (**[**$ALGS**](https://contora.ai/ticker/ALGS)**)** \- a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses to develop novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in viral and liver diseases.

Last week $ALGS has appointed Bridget Martell, MA, M.D., to the Companys board of directors and it's got hyped on Twitter. These guys are also attending the conferences and their presentations are lit!

$CYBR has risen sharply lately on the heels of a strong third-quarter report and by adding 230 new customers on the quarter. Investors need to expect volatility, as evidenced by plenty of ups and downs in share price over the past few years. Thus, when things move in the right direction it can really pay off  as it has since spring, when $CYBR stock nearly doubled from about $110 to current levels around $200 per share.

There will be no frills, no promises of short squeezes or NFTs, no grandiose catalysts such as the collapse of the entire financial system as we know it. With that in mind, proceed.


Today is November 23, 2021. 
$BBY has just released Q3 earnings today before market open sending shares plummeting -18%.

While beating earnings projections by relatively small margins, my theory in what caused such a drop is Q3 EPS falling almost 40% from Q1 and Q2 2022. 
I personally believe these inflated earnings numbers stem from unemployment assistance money, and stimulus/child tax credit money being used to purchase items from $BBY that wouldnt normally be attainable without this assistance. 

Another attributing factor to $BBYs inflated earnings in the last 2Qs is possibly an influx in sales from customers Cabin Fever + extra free time, console and video game sales are through the roof, which are a large part of Best Buys inventory.

So why would BestBuy return to trading at Q2 prices if the reason for it trading so high was inflated sales numbers caused by one in a life time external forces?

Simply put it wont, but the way I see it
Theres 20% upside sitting on the table just to get back to share prices 1 week ago.

With Black Friday, cyber Monday, and Christmas just around the corner, $BBY is poised to snap back up to its $140 share price fast enough to give you whiplash. 

This is a simple play, BBY is oversold and at a heavy discount. Now is the time to buy. DYOR and you will find the Best Buy *really is* the BEST Buy.

Some companies have posted their Q3 reports, which caused lots of social activity around the tickers. It's a nice indicator for making the investments - the more positive/negative social discussions around the company's ticker - the more chances to see the change in its stock.

Today's top will consist of 3 companies that have had most of the social buzz over the last week:

**1. Aligos Therapeutics Inc. (**[**$ALGS**](https://contora.ai/ticker/ALGS)**)** \- a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses to develop novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in viral and liver diseases.

My guess is that next week we'll get some indication from Disney that the viewership on this documentary was off the charts and it should cause the stock to moon. The IV on this thing is so low that even a few percent up move would cause calls to go up 100%. If this really caught fire, you're talking about a possible 5-10x.

Q2 and Q3 of 2021 were heavily impacted by the chip shortage and the shipping costs but none the less, the company refinanced its loans for the future by reducing their debt by $ 24 millions.  
They were able to stock enough products for their customers but the rising costs caused a slow down in the sales.

1,"11/24/2021, 01:28:33",$LPL LG Display DD part 2,Downtown-Deposit,"#  Thesis:

LG Display ($LPL) is one of the leaders in OLED display technology commanding a 100% market share in OLED TV's and 94% market share in the automotive OLED display market. Although having such a commanding position in display technology, LG Display only has a market cap of 6.6billion, sitting with a P/E ratio below 6 and an eps of 1.6. LG Display is fundamentally undervalued and will see unprecedented growth through its growing TV sales and automotive partnerships.

# OLED TV's

According to the market research firm Omdia, in Q3 2021 LG has passed the 10 million OLED TV shipments since it started shipping OLED TVs in 2013. It took LG seven years to sell its first 5 million TVs, and only 2 more years to sell the next 5 million. You can see how quickly sales are accelerating as the price of OLED panels became more reasonable.

In Q3 of this year, LG sold almost 900,000 OLED TVs, an 80% growth over Q3 2020. The total OLED TV market grew to 1.53 million in Q3, and Omdia expects it to pass the 2 million units market in Q4, another 33%.

The average selling price of LG's OLED TV was $1,863, or about three times the average selling price of an LCD TV sold worldwide.

# Automotive Partnerships

[LG Display is planning to supply 33-inch POLEDs](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/07/cadillac-lyriq-ev-will-feature-widescreen-33-inch-oled-display/) to the Cadillac EV Lyric further cementing the GM-LG Alliance and positioning LG in a great position for GM's EV expansion. GM plans to begin production of lyric at its Tennessee plant in the US in the first quarter of next year. Shipping is expected to begin in the first half of 2022. LG Display is also expected to provide POLEDs on schedule.

LG Display is a strong player in the automotive display field. According to market research firm Omdia, LG Display accounted for 25.9% (based on sales) in the market share of high-value-added displays for vehicles over 10 inches in the first quarter. The size of the automotive display market has already grown to a level that is not small at more than 10 trillion won. As it has high growth potential in the future, it will have a positive impact on LG Displays performance.

[According to Business Korea](http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=68858), the market for automotive OLED panels to surge 12-fold over the next five years; EVs to serve as the main accelerant.

***""We expect the market for automotive OLED panels to surge 12-fold over the next five years (from KRW55.7bn in 2020 to KRW292.2bn in 2023 and KRW665.9bn in 2025), which should provide a tailwind for LG Display given that the company currently holds a 94% market share(OLED panels) and KRW10tn worth of order backlog."" -Bussiness Korea***

# Counter Arguments: 

***Samsung and MicroLED:***   microLED is promising, but its facing problems with bringing to mass production in sizes smaller than an entire wall. Some estimates on when we are likely to see the tech rolled out [are as late as 2030](https://www.microled-info.com/why-microled-displays-may-take-longer-expected-reach-market). Don't think for a second that LG Display isn't on top of this tech tho, they have an average of 14 patents every day. Samsung does however want to get into the OLED TV market as soon as Q1 2022, but their margins will not be comparable with LG. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: DYOR

TL;DR; $LPL LG Display is fundamentally undervalued having a P/E under 6 and an EPS of 1.68. Their current valuation seems harder to justify having increased their OLED TV sales by 80% YTD and their growing presence in the automotive display market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0idgi/lpl_lg_display_dd_part_2/

It seemed like a very good deal at the time. MedAvail is a technology company that builds a medication dispensing kiosk with realtime video call for pharmacist consulting. I was very bullish, especially since Walmart and Sam's are deploying these kiosks in their stores in Florida as a POC. Another huge company, Kaiser Permanente, also signed a contract to deploy the kiosks in California first and later to other states.

The problem is the price has gone down to $1.88 since and for no good reason. I really believe the company has great potential as no other company is doing what they do.

Most of you apes know Qualcomm as a company that supplies chips for smartphones, but in the latest Earnings call and investors Day, Qualcomm has shown the results of its diversification plans. With roughly **40%** of the QCT **earnings being from non-handset domain.** This has clearly pleased the wall street and the stock jumped more than 40% over the last few weeks!

The main reason why I am supper bullish on Qualcomm is that they mentioned with all their diversification plans coming into fruition their total addressable market has jumped from **100B to 700B!** That is insane for company of this size.

# A brief overview of Qualcomms New &amp; Existing Markets

**The Metaverse:** 

https://preview.redd.it/g0klgm7und181.png?width=2195&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9079349fa0732c10fcbd45a33ead96f768932138

Qualcomm has been in the metaverse game before it was hip. More than **10M** Meta Oculus have been shipped containing the SnapDragon XR2 chips. They already have a strong presence in this area, and its likely to be more popular. They have acquired multiple AR related companies over the last decade and have a well-established Snapdragon Spaces Developer platform. The CEO is expecting demand for these devices to be just as big as phone market which means another market space for Qualcomm to dominate in.

**The PC market:**

Lets be honest, Qualcomms current presence is the PC space is almost negligible. But Last year Qualcomm did a very interesting acquisition of **Nuvia for 1.4B** dollars. Nuvia was a startup focused on developing ARM based high performing CPUs which was **founded by chief architect of Apple SOC**, responsible for CPUs like iphone A14 Bionic chips and also the M1 &amp; M1 pro Macbook chips! Qualcomm already has the best modem expertise in the world, and teaming up theoretically with the best CPU team is definitely gonna take a good bite out of the PC chip market share soon. Qualcomm is planning to launch its first CPU by late 2022. 

**Automotive tech:**

https://preview.redd.it/86j6smdynd181.png?width=2340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfe6050350390e98ba595f49af4aceb6ac91ab59

Qualcomm is serious about being the technology provider for most of the auto industry. It recently acquired the ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) unit of Veoneer for **4.5B** dollars. GM and BMW are one of the first companies that has agreed to power their digital cockpit with Qualcomm tech. Revenues from auto sector have already doubled since last year with **13B design wins in the pipeline** over the next few years. 

**5G Dominance:**

https://preview.redd.it/8t3u5khznd181.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f171e5d260f2b7f00d477f8f11d62f3eb81dc7

Qualcomm has decades of expertise in Communication technology, which is significantly more than any other companies. With the transition from 4G to 5G just starting, Qualcomm is set to continue dominance in the smartphone world. The big concern that investors had with Qualcomm was with Apple planning to make its own modem chips in the next few years. But QCOM is projecting that the revenues from Apple will be less than 5% within a couple of years. **Even though Apple and Samsung are making in-house chips, they cannot escape the royalties that they have to pay to Qualcomm for using their 5G patents.** So virtually every smartphone is using Qualcomm tech directly or indirectly!

**IoT Projection looks Insane and currently on track:**

https://preview.redd.it/1rxoh0l0od181.png?width=2637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80b766d721b0252482385b544cd787a7abfd4ffc

TLDR: Qualcomm is a severely undervalued at the moment, especially if you compare to Nvidia, which has less earnings than Qualcomm and still roughly 4X the market cap of $QCOM. With all the diversification plans showing results every quarter, $QCOM It is ready to launch into stratosphere. I believe Qualcomm has the potential to be one of the best tech stock over the next few years.

My Position: 250 shares and few 185c jan calls for some tendies

1,"11/24/2021, 01:03:58",InPlay Oil: Trading At Less Than 4x Free Cash Flow Using $70 WTI - SA Article,Eyes2theSkies,"# Introduction

 InPlay Oil (OTCQX:IPOOF) is a small Canadian oil and gas producer currently working on a transformational acquisition with a smaller company called Prairie Storm Resources. The combination of both entities will create economies of scale and synergy benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xes6ir62md181.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a84b09bead320d6a0615808ba583e47cb0c066

 I would strongly recommend to trade in InPlay Oil using the companys primary listing in Canada, where its trading with IPO as its ticker symbol. The current share price is C$2.11, giving the company a market capitalization of around C$144M. The average daily volume in Canada is in excess of a 250,000 shares.

# Q3 was strong 

In this article I will use a two-pronged approach. In this section Ill explain why InPlay Oil is actually reasonably valued on a standalone basis, and in the next section I will discuss the planned acquisition of a smaller ""competitor"" which will further boost InPlays results.

InPlay Oil produced on average 6,011 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in the third quarter, of which approximately 55% actually consisted of oil. The attributable production has increased by more than 50% since Q3 2020 as InPlay is taking advantage of the strong oil and gas price to boost its output. During the quarter, the company received just under C$76/barrel of oil and just under C$3.89 for its natural gas, compared to respectively C$39.5 and C$2.32 in Q3 2020.

This resulted in a total revenue of C$27M after deducting the royalties and the small loss on derivatives. As you also notice in the image below, InPlay is a low-cost producer as the company reported a pre-tax income and a net income of just under C$8.3M for the quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j3te6pk6md181.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34498072955f39bfabc7122d53be43866a0018d3

Source: financial statements

You can clearly see almost half of the total expenses are related to depreciation and amortization expenses, so the ""pure"" production costs are pretty low.

I dont want to spend too much time on the income statement as in the oil and gas sector, Im mainly interested in how much cash flow a company is making. After all, the cash flow will fund the sustaining and growth capex.

In the most recent quarter, InPlay reported an operating cash flow of C$15M before working capital changes, but after deducting the lease payments. The total capex was just around C$10.5M, resulting in a free cash flow of C$4.5M.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xwnj1jh8md181.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28cf2b98e9dcd675c6a5b6594b0046f32ce1c92c

Source: financial statements

As the total capex was about 40% higher than the depreciation and amortization charges, and as almost 40% of the 9M 2021 capex was spent in just one quarter, InPlay Oil was clearly investing cash in accelerating its growth as the company wants to further boost its output to meet its 2022 guidance.

As of the end of September, InPlay Oil had a net debt of approximately C$66M which will increase upon completing the acquisition of Prairie Storm. But thats just temporary as InPlay is guiding for the net debt to fall off a cliff in 2022 using US$70 WTI and C$3.70 AECO.

# The acquisition of Prairie Storm will kick start the 2022 results 

In September, Prairie Storm agreed to be acquired by InPlay Oil for a total consideration of C$0.2514 in cash and 0.0524 shares of InPlay Oil. At the current share price of C$2.11 of InPlay Oil, the total value of the offer is C$0.2514 + C$0.1106 = C$0.362/share which means Prairies current share price of C$0.35 is trading below the implied offered price. InPlay will be paying a total of C$40M in cash and issue about 8.3 million new shares.

I have the impression the market didnt fully understand the deal as some sellers sold Prairie Storm shares below C$0.30. I was able to scoop up some shares at C$0.30 and C$0.305 for an average of C$0.3025, and this means that for every 10,000 shares of Prairie Storm I own, I will effectively pay C$0.0511 per 0.0524 shares of InPlay Oil, which represents approximately C$0.98/share. That arbitrage opportunity now no longer exists, but one could always try to put in a buy order at C$0.325 for Prairie Storm as that would allow you to acquire InPlay Oil at C$1.56.

The arbitrage gap no longer really exists, but the InPlay-Prairie Storm deal makes sense on several levels.

After an initial round of drilling, InPlay Oil expects the Prairie Storm assets to report an average production of 2,755 boe/day in 2022, resulting in about C$31-33M of operating income and C$16.5-18.5M of free adjusted funds flow. And thanks to the very low decline rate of just around 10% on the Prairie Storm assets, the sustaining capex required to keep the production rate stable will be rather minimal.

The acquisition allowed InPlay to hike its 2022 guidance to a total production of 9,150 boe/day (the midpoint of the 8,900-9,400 boe/day guidance) resulting in a consolidated adjusted funds flow of around C$110M.

&amp;#x200B;

Source: press release

The total capex budget for 2022 is now estimated at approximately C$52M which would result in a net free cash flow of approximately C$55-59M. This will reduce the net debt to just around C$20-25M by the end of 2022, making InPlay Oil a very healthy small-scale producer.

And investors should be aware the guidance above is based on US$69.75 WTI and C$3.70 AECO. The spot prices are currently quite a bit higher so perhaps InPlay Oil could beat its guidance. But for now, lets just use the official guidance, as we can always fine tune our expectations in 2022 once we see how the oil and gas prices are behaving.

Source: company presentation

# Investment thesis 

The acquisition makes InPlay Oil cheap on basically any metric. Assuming the companys base case scenario is credible, InPlay Oil will generate in excess of C$0.60/share in free cash flow in 2022, which makes the current share price of C$2.11 still a steal.

Oil and gas companies are taking advantage of huge tailwinds right now, and using the current strip prices, InPlay could actually be debt-free by the end of next year, in which case a C$170M market cap for a company generating in excess of C$55M in free cash flow is outrageously low.

I currently dont have a position in InPlay Oil, but I have a long position in Prairie Storm and I expect to end up with a long position in InPlay Oil once the transaction closes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0htlk/inplay_oil_trading_at_less_than_4x_free_cash_flow/

1,"11/24/2021, 00:44:49",$LPL LG Display DD part 2,sell-my-information,"# Thesis:

LG Display ($LPL) is one of the leaders in OLED display technology commanding a 100% market share in OLED TV's and 94% market share in the automotive OLED display market. Although having such a commanding position in display technology, LG Display only has a market cap of 6.6billion, sitting with a P/E ratio below 6 and an eps of 1.6. LG Display is fundamentally undervalued and will see unprecedented growth through its growing TV sales and automotive partnerships.

# OLED TV's

According to the market research firm Omdia,  in Q3 2021 LG has passed the 10 million OLED TV shipments since it started shipping OLED TVs in 2013. It took LG seven years to sell its first 5 million TVs, and only 2 more years to sell the next 5 million. You can see how quickly sales are accelerating as the price of OLED panels became more reasonable. 

In Q3 of this year, LG sold almost 900,000 OLED TVs, an 80% growth over Q3 2020. The total OLED TV market grew to 1.53 million in Q3, and Omdia expects it to pass the 2 million units market in Q4, another 33%.

The average selling price of LG's OLED TV was $1,863, or about three times the average selling price of an LCD TV sold worldwide. 

# Automotive Partnerships

[LG Display is planning to supply 33-inch POLEDs](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/07/cadillac-lyriq-ev-will-feature-widescreen-33-inch-oled-display/) to the Cadillac EV Lyric further cementing the GM-LG Alliance and positioning LG in a great position for GM's EV expansion. GM plans to begin production of lyric at its Tennessee plant in the US in the first quarter of next year. Shipping is expected to begin in the first half of 2022. LG Display is also expected to provide POLEDs on schedule.

LG Display is a strong player in the automotive display field. According to market research firm Omdia, LG Display accounted for 25.9% (based on sales) in the market share of high-value-added displays for vehicles over 10 inches in the first quarter. The size of the automotive display market has already grown to a level that is not small at more than 10 trillion won. As it has high growth potential in the future, it will have a positive impact on LG Displays performance.

[According to Business Korea](http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=68858), the market for automotive OLED panels to surge 12-fold over the next five years; EVs to serve as the main accelerant.  

***""We expect the market for automotive OLED panels to surge 12-fold over the next five years (from KRW55.7bn in 2020 to KRW292.2bn in 2023 and KRW665.9bn in 2025), which should provide a tailwind for LG Display given that the company currently holds a 94% market share(OLED panels) and KRW10tn worth of order backlog."" -Bussiness Korea***

Tony Aquila the CEO of Canoo, through the use of shell companies bought 35.3 mil shares from another insider, DD Global Holdings and he's not done he will also be looking to buy another 18 mil from them as well.  Currently Tony Aquila controls 21% of the voting rights. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why does this matter if the share were not part of the float in the first place?

Because while other pre-revenue EV CEOs are selling millions of shares frauding their investors, this is the only CEO to YOLOing almost his entire net worth in to his work. Examples being: Lordstown Motors, Fisker and Nikola. 

Tony has been secretive about what is going on behind the scenes at Canoo but him willing to buy $270 mil worth of shares with another $120 mil worth of shares on the way is SUPER BULLISH.

  
Why do I say that Christmas came early? 

Because shorts are trying to keep the price down as much as possible to lessen the pain. Canoo is currently down 8% today so anyone opening new positions or adding to their positions are going to be happy pretty soon. As of this morning there is an estimated 42.68 mil shares borrowed (ORTEX). Calculating the short interest for Canoo is easy since the Free Float is 99.3 mil so, SI is around 42% of the free float. I'm not going to say anything but that its super high and ready to do something that will ban my post. Last Friday 2.6 mil shares worth of calls ended ITM shorts are losing their ability to keep the price down.

Until you factor in money supply. I cant seem to find a way to apply money supply to 1929 but looking at historical data, inflation was actually negative then?

1,"11/24/2021, 00:00:09",$IPO (TSX) In-Play Oil - SA Article,Eyes2theSkies,"Introduction InPlay Oil (OTCQX:IPOOF) is a small Canadian oil and gas producer currently working on a transformational acquisition with a smaller company called Prairie Storm Resources. The combination of both entities will create economies of scale and synergy benefits.

Chart Data by YCharts I would strongly recommend to trade in InPlay Oil using the companys primary listing in Canada, where its trading with IPO as its ticker symbol. The current share price is C$2.11, giving the company a market capitalization of around C$144M. The average daily volume in Canada is in excess of a 250,000 shares.

Q3 was strong In this article I will use a two-pronged approach. In this section Ill explain why InPlay Oil is actually reasonably valued on a standalone basis, and in the next section I will discuss the planned acquisition of a smaller ""competitor"" which will further boost InPlays results.

InPlay Oil produced on average 6,011 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in the third quarter, of which approximately 55% actually consisted of oil. The attributable production has increased by more than 50% since Q3 2020 as InPlay is taking advantage of the strong oil and gas price to boost its output. During the quarter, the company received just under C$76/barrel of oil and just under C$3.89 for its natural gas, compared to respectively C$39.5 and C$2.32 in Q3 2020.

This resulted in a total revenue of C$27M after deducting the royalties and the small loss on derivatives. As you also notice in the image below, InPlay is a low-cost producer as the company reported a pre-tax income and a net income of just under C$8.3M for the quarter.

Source: financial statements

You can clearly see almost half of the total expenses are related to depreciation and amortization expenses, so the ""pure"" production costs are pretty low.

I dont want to spend too much time on the income statement as in the oil and gas sector, Im mainly interested in how much cash flow a company is making. After all, the cash flow will fund the sustaining and growth capex.

In the most recent quarter, InPlay reported an operating cash flow of C$15M before working capital changes, but after deducting the lease payments. The total capex was just around C$10.5M, resulting in a free cash flow of C$4.5M.

Source: financial statements

As the total capex was about 40% higher than the depreciation and amortization charges, and as almost 40% of the 9M 2021 capex was spent in just one quarter, InPlay Oil was clearly investing cash in accelerating its growth as the company wants to further boost its output to meet its 2022 guidance.

As of the end of September, InPlay Oil had a net debt of approximately C$66M which will increase upon completing the acquisition of Prairie Storm. But thats just temporary as InPlay is guiding for the net debt to fall off a cliff in 2022 using US$70 WTI and C$3.70 AECO.

The acquisition of Prairie Storm will kick start the 2022 results In September, Prairie Storm agreed to be acquired by InPlay Oil for a total consideration of C$0.2514 in cash and 0.0524 shares of InPlay Oil. At the current share price of C$2.11 of InPlay Oil, the total value of the offer is C$0.2514 + C$0.1106 = C$0.362/share which means Prairies current share price of C$0.35 is trading below the implied offered price. InPlay will be paying a total of C$40M in cash and issue about 8.3 million new shares.

I have the impression the market didnt fully understand the deal as some sellers sold Prairie Storm shares below C$0.30. I was able to scoop up some shares at C$0.30 and C$0.305 for an average of C$0.3025, and this means that for every 10,000 shares of Prairie Storm I own, I will effectively pay C$0.0511 per 0.0524 shares of InPlay Oil, which represents approximately C$0.98/share. That arbitrage opportunity now no longer exists, but one could always try to put in a buy order at C$0.325 for Prairie Storm as that would allow you to acquire InPlay Oil at C$1.56.

The arbitrage gap no longer really exists, but the InPlay-Prairie Storm deal makes sense on several levels.

After an initial round of drilling, InPlay Oil expects the Prairie Storm assets to report an average production of 2,755 boe/day in 2022, resulting in about C$31-33M of operating income and C$16.5-18.5M of free adjusted funds flow. And thanks to the very low decline rate of just around 10% on the Prairie Storm assets, the sustaining capex required to keep the production rate stable will be rather minimal.

The acquisition allowed InPlay to hike its 2022 guidance to a total production of 9,150 boe/day (the midpoint of the 8,900-9,400 boe/day guidance) resulting in a consolidated adjusted funds flow of around C$110M.

Source: press release

The total capex budget for 2022 is now estimated at approximately C$52M which would result in a net free cash flow of approximately C$55-59M. This will reduce the net debt to just around C$20-25M by the end of 2022, making InPlay Oil a very healthy small-scale producer.

And investors should be aware the guidance above is based on US$69.75 WTI and C$3.70 AECO. The spot prices are currently quite a bit higher so perhaps InPlay Oil could beat its guidance. But for now, lets just use the official guidance, as we can always fine tune our expectations in 2022 once we see how the oil and gas prices are behaving.

Source: company presentation

Investment thesis The acquisition makes InPlay Oil cheap on basically any metric. Assuming the companys base case scenario is credible, InPlay Oil will generate in excess of C$0.60/share in free cash flow in 2022, which makes the current share price of C$2.11 still a steal.

Oil and gas companies are taking advantage of huge tailwinds right now, and using the current strip prices, InPlay could actually be debt-free by the end of next year, in which case a C$170M market cap for a company generating in excess of C$55M in free cash flow is outrageously low.

I currently dont have a position in InPlay Oil, but I have a long position in Prairie Storm and I expect to end up with a long position in InPlay Oil once the transaction closes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0gdxy/ipo_tsx_inplay_oil_sa_article/

However, if youre looking for a quick trade or pump, this is not it.  I wrote this to have a searchable document for future reference.  It addresses much of the false and misleading information thats been published on Paysafe. This undervalued Fintech represents around 15% of my portfolio but I continue to drill down on it because I find it the most intriguing with significant and reliable long-term upside.

In the short term, anything is possible. Q3ER is pre-market, [November 11](https://ir.paysafe.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/118/paysafe-reschedules-third-quarter-earnings-results-to).  ForDespite beating Q2 consensus on [revenue](https://www.tipranks.com/news/paysafe-q2-revenue-tops-estimates-shares-fall-16/) and [earnings per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSFE), reporting a [41% gain](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-reports-second-quarter-2021-105500808.html) in total volume and reaffirming full-year guidance, the stock price severely gapped down and continued to fall 30%, on soft [Q3 guidance](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qcxsjc/paysafes_q3_guidance_pointing_to_q4/).

By any reasonable measure, the already guided Q3 miss is more than priced in at this point.

I hesitated to share this because it may simply be best for those lacking conviction in PSFEs long-term value to sell so that the upcoming trend reversal can take hold.  Still, I believe in making decisions based on accurate information. A recent [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) indicates that the stocks downtrend is not the institutional selling that bears have claimed (see Parts 4 &amp; 5), but a rotation away from retail shareholders who, like whipped dogs beat into submission, are easily shaken out by disinformation and tactical intraday short volume (there has been plenty of both). As Paysafe Chairman Bill Foley [acknowledged](https://investor.cannaeholdings.com/static-files/39080000-7cb6-4379-8650-9a10ebde608b), the stock has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.

Some have justifiably complained that management is not engaging the media to support share value. As the number of institutional owners has grown from 180 to 297 over the last quarter, it may simply be that management is quietly allowing a more stable investor base to take over in order to better secure long-term share value. After all, from the outset Foley did give fair warning that hes not concerned with short-term investors (oddly cut from this [interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/29/bill-foley-on-why-hes-excited-to-take-paysafe-public-via-spac-merger.html)).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: As an off-ramp from the in-depth review below, heres a fair assessment from RBCs 5-star analyst [Daniel Perlin](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/daniel-perlin): PSFE remains a complex story as the company grows over divestitures and portfolio adjustments, creating difficult comparisons, while also calibrating the Street on weaker seasonal patterns implicit in Q3/21 guidance, followed by an expected rebound in Q4. In addition, recent acquisitions push leverage to \~5.3x net debt-to-(adj.)EBITDA, which should de-lever quickly heading into FY22, but likely pressures the stock near-term as investors peel back the layers to gain visibility into H2/21 and into FY22.  (Perlin rates it a Buy w/ $15 PT.)

With that, heres one persons attempt to peel back the layers on:

1. Growth
2. Debt
3. Profit
4. Float
5. Blackstone Group
6. Insider Ownership
7. Competition
8. Management
9. Lockup Expiry
10. Valuation

Note: Since theres a lot to cover, Ill break this up into 4 posts as I write them over the next 4 days.  (The section headings above will become links.)

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. Growth

Paysafe just went public 6 months ago so its natural to focus on very recent numbers which reflect a 12-18 month transitional slow-down due to Covid-related closures of live sporting events and brick &amp; mortar retail along with strategic exits as part of the companys efforts to de-risk future growth.

In the coming quarters, management expects bolstered growth from a post-Covid reopening, a lapping of legacy de-risking measures, their ongoing expansion into the US iGaming market, and their ongoing US rollout of digital wallet Skrill, which is expected to become a second engine of growth on top of the payment processing growth.

Unlike many companies going public with lofty growth projections, Paysafes investor presentation offered the initial estimate of 10.4% growth, conservatively pegging it to the payments sector as a whole.  However, in a recent [conference](https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-digitalbanking-paysafe#/), the Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh quietly upgraded that projection with a revealing break down of their business mix:

* 45% of business is expected to grow 8-10%
* 55% of their business is expected to grow 15-20%.

Thats a weighted organic growth of 11.9 - 15.5%.

Add in the expected 3.9% inorganic growth from their two recent LATAM acquisitions ($60m rev@55%CAGR), and that 10.4% projection suddenly looks more like 15.8% to 19.4%.

For a mature company operating at scale with over $100 billion in transactional volume, thats solid growth on par with PayPals last three-year range of 15.02% - 20.72%.

As a reference, this would put Paysafe's 2022E revenue between $1.79 to $1.87 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $1.75 billion.

Additional factors not yet included in growth projections:

1. Due to that 45%/55% business mix, when over half of the business is growing twice as fast as the rest, the weighted blend shifts over time until that faster growth rate predominates.
2. That same compounding effect on overall blend applies to the two acquisitions, PagoEfectivo and Miami-based SafetyPay, [reported](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf) to be growing at a combined 55% CAGR with 80%+ bank coverage in Latin America, one of the fastest growing eCommerce markets out there.
3. Moreover, forward growth estimates do not factor in several post synergy multiples related to these acquisitions. For example, Paysafes eCash and digital wallet products will be introduced to fertile markets where more than half of the population fits their underbanked target profile (i.e. those who primarily use cash; dont have bank accounts or credit cards or simply want to protect their personal information but are actively moving to mobile devices and seeking ways to engage in eCommerce, iGaming and digital person to person payments). 
4. Including SafetyPays 20,000 new collection points in seven European countries, the two deals add a combined 320,000 collection points and 90% bank coverage over 11 new Latin American countries, giving Paysafe one of the largest Fintech footprints in the region. Management says: These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhance our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units.
5. Also not yet factored into projections, these acquisitions lay critical groundwork in Latin Americas emerging sports betting market, [estimated](https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2021/08/03/58633-online-sports-betting-grows-rapidly-in-latin-america) to be worth $7-10 billion, growing at 20% CAGR. Importantly, with Paysafes direct marketing and leadership in iGaming payment processing, the deals facilitate easy expansion for their many partners like Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, Betfred, bet365 etc. As CEO McHugh notes, We service Xbox, Youtube, Spotify and iGaming companies. And just being able to connect global companies to more and more markets with a single relationship was an easy synergy for us.
6. Additionally, SafetyPay recently tapped into 134 million new customers with the recent [rollout](https://www.qrcodepress.com/safetypay-qr-codes/8539360/) of its QR codes across Brazil enabling real-time transactions on the PIX mobile payment platform, with a [TPV of $100 billion](https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1452229529771122696?s=20). This new QR code offers the unique benefit of [allowing](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/safetypay-launches-qr-codes-for-real-time-payments-in-brazil-301294286.html) non-credit card holders and fraud-wary consumers to make bank payments and engage in eCommerce without risking personal information. Brazil is expected to account for a [third](https://thefintechtimes.com/safetypay-qr-codes-and-cross-border-transactions-are-top-priority-for-payments-in-latin-america/) of the LATAM eCommerce market.
7. Further, projections dont yet include inorganic/organic growth or potential synergies from their third recent acquisition, [viafintech](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210822005021/en/Paysafe-to-Acquire-viafintech/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-XEemlDQ6NgDkiei3bSxnzGlJCVVeQL8sr5Wvng8AXxRSfe41V1BKA-b6v2ZVrSSNs-dUYKiDvY7XniNSqv88QcY1Ge_vf9QIMZ4alzIf_0HE01s4RTGeX_C4TDnN9C9Cg==), which adds a network of 20,000 points of sale in six European countries. This expands their eCash business (just posted 37% YoY growth), which taps into the underbanked as described above (1.7 billion consumers globally). While this deal protected and gained market shares, it was also a KYC software acquisition that will provide their digital wallets with a more streamlined point-of-sale mobile ATM function through phone-based digital banking. Management expects this to better position Paysafe as an essential payments partner to challenger banks around the world as consumer banking habits continue to evolve. Direct relationships with rapidly growing branchless challenger bank (AKA neobanks) are a key driver in Paysafes growth strategy in [open banking](https://www.digitaltransactions.net/how-paysafe-sees-its-safetypay-deal-as-a-major-move-into-open-banking/).
8. The viafintech deal also includes a new strategic partnership with Glory Ltd to add Paysafes eCash solution, paysafecard, to its global physical presence. Glory Ltd, (11,000 employees), has physical locations in 20 countries and is used in 100 countries across Europe, Asia, N.America, S.America, the Middle East and Africa.
9. Enhanced global eCash/digital synergy: Once integrated, these three acquisitions bring Paysafes global eCash business to over a million distribution points in 60 countries. Along with their newly launched US advertising [campaign](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210928005792/en/) for Skrill, the integration of their digital wallets and eCash platforms in these new markets greatly enhance Paysafes position in the large US/LATAM and EU/LATAM remittance markets. Notably, viafintech recently announced a [deal](https://ffnews.com/newsarticle/viafintech-and-n26-launch-cash26-in-spain-a-service-for-digital-banking/) in Spain with fast growing neobank N26 which, combined with Paysafe's other acquisitions, creates a direct connection in the $18 billion remittance market between Spain and South America. Overall, this is a high-margin $700 billion global market.
10. US wagering: Paysafe is already established with 75% of all US iGaming operators and they just [reported](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf) a 72% increase in year-over-year volume with a 48% YoY increase in revenue, however, their growth estimates dont include the many US states expected to legalize sports betting going forward.
11. Paysafes growth estimates also dont include the full potential from Canadas newly legalized betting market. This is a market where Paysafe is already positioned with 100% of all operators. Starting at roughly $1 billion, Deloitte Canada projects 94% CAGR to [$28 billion within five years](https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/ca-new-stakes-in-the-game.html) ($22 billion USD).
12. Paysafe also dominates sports betting in Europe which, according to The European Business Review, is projected to grow 30.6% CAGR, more than tripling from $24.7 billion Euros in 2020 to 94 billion Euros ($109 billion USD) by 2024.
13. Its important to note that, as a payment processor, Paysafes revenue is not made up from a fraction of iGaming operator revenue, but as a fraction of total pay-in/pay-out transactional volume (TPV). Over the next five years, the US sports betting handle (pay-in wagering) is [estimated](https://www.financialnewsmedia.com/global-sports-betting-market-size-is-expected-to-grow-by-144-billion-by-2025/) by some to grow to as much as $180 billion. With Paysafes expectation of 20% US marketshare, the TPV of the US market alone has the potential to triple Paysafes overall revenue. This is not a prediction but an interesting reference for the implications of Paysafes dominant position in these many high-growth markets, all with long-term secular tailwinds.
14. Lastly, Paysafes newly launched travel safeguarding [model](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Safeguarding-the-future-of-travel.pdf), presents another new revenue stream that should not be discounted. Demand for this unique new offering is self evident.  Almost as soon as it was [announced,](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) they signed a [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with [ARC](https://www2.arccorp.com/globalassets/about-us/our-data/third-party/arc-data.pdf), who has a network of over 200 major airlines globally and processes $97 billion annually.

With their recent expansion into new untapped markets and their unquestioned dominance in existing markets estimated to ramp to 30-94% CAGR, its not a stretch to consider that the compounded effect of the above fourteen factors taken together, might add a modest 5-10% to overall growth (I suspect more).  Add that to the 15.8% to 19.4% growth described above, and the resulting 21-30% annual growth would practically double the growth model on which 9 analysts have based their average price target of \~$14.

Time will tell but such a growth prospect is supported their recently reported 41% increase in volume and an adjusted 23% YoY revenue growth, when excluding last years divestiture and discrete Direct Marketing exits (both part of their strategy to de-risk forward growth).  It also doesnt hurt that, including that slow period, they have a long track record of 30.7% CAGR between 2011 and 2020 ([$128m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).

I hesitated to share this because it may simply be best for those lacking conviction in PSFEs long-term value to sell so that the upcoming trend reversal can take hold.  Still, I believe in making decisions based on accurate information. A recent [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) indicates that the stocks downtrend is not the institutional selling that bears have claimed (see Parts 4 &amp; 5), but a rotation away from retail shareholders who, like whipped dogs beat into submission, are easily shaken out by disinformation and tactical intraday short volume (there has been plenty of both). As Paysafe Chairman Bill Foley [acknowledged](https://investor.cannaeholdings.com/static-files/39080000-7cb6-4379-8650-9a10ebde608b), the stock has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.

Some have justifiably complained that management is not engaging the media to support share value. As the number of institutional owners has grown from 180 to 297 over the last quarter, it may simply be that management is quietly allowing a more stable investor base to take over in order to better secure long-term share value. After all, from the outset Foley did give fair warning that hes not concerned with short-term investors (oddly cut from this [interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/29/bill-foley-on-why-hes-excited-to-take-paysafe-public-via-spac-merger.html)).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: As an off-ramp from the in-depth review below, heres a fair assessment from RBCs 5-star analyst [Daniel Perlin](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/daniel-perlin): PSFE remains a complex story as the company grows over divestitures and portfolio adjustments, creating difficult comparisons, while also calibrating the Street on weaker seasonal patterns implicit in Q3/21 guidance, followed by an expected rebound in Q4. In addition, recent acquisitions push leverage to \~5.3x net debt-to-(adj.)EBITDA, which should de-lever quickly heading into FY22, but likely pressures the stock near-term as investors peel back the layers to gain visibility into H2/21 and into FY22.  (Perlin rates it a Buy w/ $15 PT and expects -$0.07 EPS for Q3.)

With that, heres one persons attempt to peel back the layers on:

1. Growth
2. Debt
3. Profit
4. Float
5. Blackstone Group
6. Insider Ownership
7. Competition
8. Management
9. Lockup Expiry
10. Valuation

Note: Since theres a lot to cover, Ill break this up into 4 posts as I write them over the next 4 days.  (The section headings above will become links.)

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. Growth

Paysafe just went public 6 months ago so its natural to focus on very recent numbers which reflect a 12-18 month transitional slow-down due to Covid-related closures of live sporting events and brick &amp; mortar retail along with strategic exits as part of the companys efforts to de-risk future growth.

In the coming quarters, management expects bolstered growth from a post-Covid reopening, a lapping of legacy de-risking measures, their ongoing expansion into the US iGaming market, and their ongoing US rollout of digital wallet Skrill, which is expected to become a second engine of growth on top of the payment processing growth.

Unlike many companies going public with lofty growth projections, Paysafes investor presentation offered the initial estimate of 10.4% growth, conservatively pegging it to the payments sector as a whole.  However, in a recent [conference](https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-digitalbanking-paysafe#/), the Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh quietly upgraded that projection with a revealing break down of their business mix:

* 45% of business is expected to grow 8-10%
* 55% of their business is expected to grow 15-20%.

Thats a weighted organic growth of 11.9 - 15.5%.

Add in the expected 3.9% inorganic growth from their two recent LATAM acquisitions ($60m rev@55%CAGR), and that 10.4% projection suddenly looks more like 15.8% to 19.4%.

For a mature company operating at scale with over $100 billion in transactional volume, thats solid growth on par with PayPals last three-year range of 15.02% - 20.72%.

As a reference, this would put Paysafe's 2022E revenue between $1.79 to $1.87 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $1.75 billion.

Additional factors not yet included in growth projections:

1. Due to that 45%/55% business mix, when over half of the business is growing twice as fast as the rest, the weighted blend shifts over time until that faster growth rate predominates.
2. That same compounding effect on overall blend applies to the two acquisitions, PagoEfectivo and Miami-based SafetyPay, [reported](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf) to be growing at a combined 55% CAGR with 80%+ bank coverage in Latin America, one of the fastest growing eCommerce markets out there.
3. Moreover, forward growth estimates do not factor in several post synergy multiples related to these acquisitions. For example, Paysafes eCash and digital wallet products will be introduced to fertile markets where more than half of the population fits their underbanked target profile (i.e. those who primarily use cash; dont have bank accounts or credit cards or simply want to protect their personal information but are actively moving to mobile devices and seeking ways to engage in eCommerce, iGaming and digital person to person payments). 
4. Including SafetyPays 20,000 new collection points in seven European countries, the two deals add a combined 320,000 collection points and 90% bank coverage over 11 new Latin American countries, giving Paysafe one of the largest Fintech footprints in the region. Management says: These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhance our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units.
5. Also not yet factored into projections, these acquisitions lay critical groundwork in Latin Americas emerging sports betting market, [estimated](https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2021/08/03/58633-online-sports-betting-grows-rapidly-in-latin-america) to be worth $7-10 billion, growing at 20% CAGR. Importantly, with Paysafes direct marketing and leadership in iGaming payment processing, the deals facilitate easy expansion for their many partners like Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, Betfred, bet365 etc. As CEO McHugh notes, We service Xbox, Youtube, Spotify and iGaming companies. And just being able to connect global companies to more and more markets with a single relationship was an easy synergy for us.
6. Additionally, SafetyPay recently tapped into 134 million new customers with the recent [rollout](https://www.qrcodepress.com/safetypay-qr-codes/8539360/) of its QR codes across Brazil enabling real-time transactions on the PIX mobile payment platform, with a [TPV of $100 billion](https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1452229529771122696?s=20). This new QR code offers the unique benefit of [allowing](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/safetypay-launches-qr-codes-for-real-time-payments-in-brazil-301294286.html) non-credit card holders and fraud-wary consumers to make bank payments and engage in eCommerce without risking personal information. Brazil is expected to account for a [third](https://thefintechtimes.com/safetypay-qr-codes-and-cross-border-transactions-are-top-priority-for-payments-in-latin-america/) of the LATAM eCommerce market.
7. Further, projections dont yet include inorganic/organic growth or potential synergies from their third recent acquisition, [viafintech](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210822005021/en/Paysafe-to-Acquire-viafintech/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-XEemlDQ6NgDkiei3bSxnzGlJCVVeQL8sr5Wvng8AXxRSfe41V1BKA-b6v2ZVrSSNs-dUYKiDvY7XniNSqv88QcY1Ge_vf9QIMZ4alzIf_0HE01s4RTGeX_C4TDnN9C9Cg==), which adds a network of 20,000 points of sale in six European countries. This expands their eCash business (just posted 37% YoY growth), which taps into the underbanked as described above (1.7 billion consumers globally). While this deal protected and gained market shares, it was also a KYC software acquisition that will provide their digital wallets with a more streamlined point-of-sale mobile ATM function through phone-based digital banking. Management expects this to better position Paysafe as an essential payments partner to challenger banks around the world as consumer banking habits continue to evolve. Direct relationships with rapidly growing branchless challenger bank (AKA neobanks) are a key driver in Paysafes growth strategy in [open banking](https://www.digitaltransactions.net/how-paysafe-sees-its-safetypay-deal-as-a-major-move-into-open-banking/).
8. The viafintech deal also includes a new strategic partnership with Glory Ltd to add Paysafes eCash solution, paysafecard, to its global physical presence. Glory Ltd, (11,000 employees), has physical locations in 20 countries and is used in 100 countries across Europe, Asia, N.America, S.America, the Middle East and Africa.
9. Enhanced global eCash/digital synergy: Once integrated, these three acquisitions bring Paysafes global eCash business to over a million distribution points in 60 countries. Along with their newly launched US advertising [campaign](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210928005792/en/) for Skrill, the integration of their digital wallets and eCash platforms in these new markets greatly enhance Paysafes position in the large US/LATAM and EU/LATAM remittance markets. Notably, viafintech recently announced a [deal](https://ffnews.com/newsarticle/viafintech-and-n26-launch-cash26-in-spain-a-service-for-digital-banking/) in Spain with fast growing neobank N26 which, combined with Paysafe's other acquisitions, creates a direct connection in the $18 billion remittance market between Spain and South America. Overall, this is a high-margin $700 billion global market.
10. US wagering: Paysafe is already established with 75% of all US iGaming operators and they just [reported](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf) a 72% increase in year-over-year volume with a 48% YoY increase in revenue, however, their growth estimates dont include the many US states expected to legalize sports betting going forward.
11. Paysafes growth estimates also dont include the full potential from Canadas newly legalized betting market. This is a market where Paysafe is already positioned with 100% of all operators. Starting at roughly $1 billion, Deloitte Canada projects 94% CAGR to [$28 billion within five years](https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/ca-new-stakes-in-the-game.html) ($22 billion USD).
12. Paysafe also dominates sports betting in Europe which, according to The European Business Review, is projected to grow 30.6% CAGR, more than tripling from $24.7 billion Euros in 2020 to 94 billion Euros ($109 billion USD) by 2024.
13. Its important to note that, as a payment processor, Paysafes revenue is not made up from a fraction of iGaming operator revenue, but as a fraction of total pay-in/pay-out transactional volume (TPV). Over the next five years, the US sports betting handle (pay-in wagering) is [estimated](https://www.financialnewsmedia.com/global-sports-betting-market-size-is-expected-to-grow-by-144-billion-by-2025/) by some to grow to as much as $180 billion. With Paysafes expectation of 20% US marketshare, the TPV of the US market alone has the potential to triple Paysafes overall revenue. This is not a prediction but an interesting reference for the implications of Paysafes dominant position in these many high-growth markets, all with long-term secular tailwinds.
14. Lastly, Paysafes newly launched travel safeguarding [model](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Safeguarding-the-future-of-travel.pdf), presents another new revenue stream that should not be discounted. Demand for this unique new offering is self evident.  Almost as soon as it was [announced,](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) they signed a [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with [ARC](https://www2.arccorp.com/globalassets/about-us/our-data/third-party/arc-data.pdf), who has a network of over 200 major airlines globally and processes $97 billion annually.

With their recent expansion into new untapped markets and their unquestioned dominance in existing markets estimated to ramp to 30-94% CAGR, its not a stretch to consider that the compounded effect of the above fourteen factors taken together, might add a modest 5-10% to overall growth (I suspect more).  Add that to the 15.8% to 19.4% growth described above, and the resulting 21-30% annual growth would practically double the growth model on which 9 analysts have based their average price target of \~$14.

Time will tell but such a growth prospect is supported their recently reported 41% increase in volume and an adjusted 23% YoY revenue growth, when excluding last years divestiture and discrete Direct Marketing exits (both part of their strategy to de-risk forward growth).  It also doesnt hurt that, including that slow period, they have a long track record of 30.7% CAGR between 2011 and 2020 ([$128m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).

I have been watching this stock for several months now, I was so intrigued with the vision &amp; research this company is doing I started the subreddit   r/arterlo 

what is going on at ARTL? [https://catchingnews.com/2021/11/01/why-is-artelo-biosciences-inc-artl-stock-rising-in-premarket/](https://catchingnews.com/2021/11/01/why-is-artelo-biosciences-inc-artl-stock-rising-in-premarket/)

 

ARTL [reported](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artelo-biosciences-announces-publication-study-123000720.html) on 4th August 2021 that Medical Cannabis and Cannabinoids have published the studys findings. The experiments were set up to investigate the in vitro effects of pure natural and synthetic forms of Cannabidiol (CBD) in human cell lines to see whether there were any pharmacological differences. Purified natural CBD has no antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, or permeability properties in vitro, according to the research.

Moreover, proprietary cocrystal contains CBD and tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), both of which exhibit anti-cancer capabilities in vitro and in vivo. Both of these substances, however, have low oral bioavailability as individuals. CBD and TMP had synergistic and additive interactions when it came to preventing cancer cell development and killing cancer cells. As a result, experts believe that ART12.11 is a promising medication candidate with the potential to treat a wide range of diseases, including cancer, PTSD, inflammatory bowel disease, and others. Lastly, recently granted composition of matter patents might provide market exclusivity until 2038.

I hope this sheds some positive light on what can &amp; will be a drug that will bring relief to millions of people!

COVID19 Link: ~ Inovio  $ino 11/1/21,WallStBull10Point0,"Prime-boost vaccination regimens with INO-4800 and INO-4802 augment and broaden immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates

Abstract

The enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion associated with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants demands the development of next-generation vaccines capable of inducing superior protection amid a shifting pandemic landscape. Since a portion of the global population harbors some level of immunity from vaccines based on the original Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 sequence or natural infection, an important question going forward is whether this immunity can be boosted by next-generation vaccines that target emerging variants while simultaneously maintaining long-term protection against existing strains. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of INO-4800, our synthetic DNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19 currently in clinical evaluation, and INO-4802, a next-generation DNA vaccine designed to broadly target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, as booster vaccines in nonhuman primates. Rhesus macaques primed over one year prior with the first-generation INO-4800 vaccine were boosted with either INO-4800 or INO-4802 in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens. Both boosting schedules led to an expansion of antibody responses which were characterized by improved neutralizing and ACE2 blocking activity across wild-type SARS-CoV-2 as well as multiple variants of concern. These data illustrate the durability of immunity following vaccination with INO-4800 and additionally support the use of either INO-4800 or INO-4802 in prime-boost regimens.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkf41t/today_we_announced_the_preprint_publication_in/

This presents an interesting opportunity if the Braves are able to win the world series currently ongoing. Should the Braves win, it may provide a catalyst for baseball fans who ordinarily don't retail trade to jump into the stock. Alternatively, if the Braves lose, the stock could plummet, making for an interesting short play. If long, would sell the news on the catalyst, as the company has negative EPS and has been skyrocketing the past few weeks.

* Over 2.6 Million Subscribers - an increase from 300k in 2015 - with 96% retention rate
* After SPAC merger with MYX Fitness, now sells bikes similar to Peloton for less
   * Monthly subcription is also around $10/month less than Peloton
* Trading at very low levels currently of around $5.40 compared to 52-week high over $18
* ""BODi"" was just launched - interactive premium tier of Beachbody on Demand last month

With 3Q financial results to be released soon, below are some 2Q highlights:

* 2Q results showed $347 Million cash position with NO debt
* 2-yr revenue growth +21%, subcriptions +55%, total streams +75%, engagement +330BPS
* YTD revenue up 16% YOY
   * YTD digital revenue up 34% YOY
* Increased fitness bike sales forecast by 30% to 95k units

Anyway, just wanted to pass along the information. In all reality, the stock should be in the $15-20 range at least based on performance and initiatives. No negative news has come out, volume is just low as the surge in initial excitement after the merger has fallen off causing the stock price to steadily decrease. Honestly feel like some interest and volume for the stock would do wonders, especially looking at the market depth and current asks, so positive news around earnings will likely cause a significant bump.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkeiu2/body_beachbody_looks_very_favorable_with_positive/
1,"11/01/2021, 21:49:10",JP Morgan &amp; Financial Times vs The Short Seller,PrudentGardener,"Are the Financial Times (FT) &amp; JP Morgan being outsmarted by Viceroy Research who with their unproven sources have the truth and discovered possible market manipulation by JP Morgan and/or FT?

**TimeLine:**

6th August 2021 Bloomberg news stated JP Morgan were assisting Adler Group real estate with the sale of bonds.

6th Oct 2021 Viceroy Research short seller report makes numerous assertions against Adler Group which drop the share price over 25% using open source and cited reporting which the markets have freely available.

29th Oct 2021 Financial Times gets an interview from Adler supposed owner Cevdet Caner which shows his family trust benefits from ownership &amp; shares.

1st Nov 2021 Viceroy Research state JP Morgan internal emails show they are also shorting Adler however no evidence produced. On the same date the Financial Times state JP Morgan is backing Adler.

**The Questions:**

Are JP Morgan staff more likely to be honest with Viceroy Research than the FT or is it possible JP Morgan are playing the FT to put out media articles which are then shorted to catch the market out when Viceroy research releases its reports?

**The effect:**

The FT have come out looking like they have been played by either JP Morgan who's staff (although not proven) have passed the alternative truth to Viceroy Research.

**The missed opportunities &amp; outcomes:**

Viceroy open source information dates back to 2016 which must have been ignored by JP Morgan and its analysts who would have access, as such they are possibly purposefully misusing client investments to pour into Adler Real Estate however Viceroy Research state they in fact have done the opposite.

There are 4 (or more) possible outcomes:

1. FT have been used by JP Morgan so they can manipulate then gain from Adler share drop.
2. FT sources at JP Morgan lied to them instead giving highly sensitive emails to Viceroy Research
3. Viceroy Research unnamed source is fictitious and there is something driving them to cite JP Morgan conflicting reporting (only Viceroy have seen) as such undermine FT reporting credibility and JP Morgan fund manager honesty and skills.
4. Viceroy Research are the only party telling and holding the facts and Adler is a corrupt cabal of James Bond Villains who have lied to everyone.

**The takeaway:**

We live in a soundbite age now where short sellers like Viceroy Research have gone from multiple cited sources (the right way to do it) into what they self state as 'gossip' 1 line Tweets without source proof which goes against JP Morgan &amp; Financial Times. This infers that we cannot trust the market makers and/or the mainstream financial media to get the facts right and pass them onto customers (as words or safe investment options).

Feels a bit personal to go from valid research to mere unreferenced claims but maybe theres a motive being paid for which needs Viceroy Research to maintain momentum even when unable to provide proofs. The point is potentially Adler is corrupt, JP Morgan is manipulating markets via soundbites provided to FT which are counter the truth or FT is potentially involved in a triangle of market manipulation and **Viceroy Research have discovered it - This is why Short sellers are needed!**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkee0d/jp_morgan_financial_times_vs_the_short_seller/

1,"11/01/2021, 21:17:37",Why I bet on Hydrogen Vehicles instead of fully electric vehicles. An analysis of $HYZN (Hyzon Motors).,FatFreeSkimmedMilk,"Hello all. Hope everyone's having a good Monday morning without too much a hangover after Halloween. I'll keep this simple: **I think Hyzon Motors is a good bet with short term &amp; long term profitability**.

**Here a quick recap:**

1. **Who are Hyzon Motors?**

Hyzon Motors ($HYZN) are a global supplier of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cell powered commercial vehicles, including heavy duty trucks, buses and coaches. They recently partnered to start [testing on airplane hydrogen](https://www.bbntimes.com/society/zeroavia-selects-hyzon-motors-to-power-its-test-flights) powering with Zeroavia whom [plans to do domestic European flights soon.](https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2021/10/29/zeroavia-plans-hydrogen-electric-flights-between-london-and-rotterdam-in-2024/) They innovate by providing the fuel cells to **existing vehicle mainframes and also building new specialized vehicles**. They operate in Oceania, Europe &amp; North America. [They released their first hydrogen coach in Australia, attracting many local and regional bus operators.](https://thedriven.io/2021/10/27/hyzon-motors-debuts-first-hydrogen-fuel-cell-coach-in-brisbane/) And also recently announced that alongside their 500 million $ in cash at the bank that they would soon expand their European factory to expand from [its existing 500 trucks per year production to 1000 per year](https://hyzonmotors.com/hyzon-motors-europe-manufacturing-facility-capable-of-producing-500-hydrogen-powered-fuel-cell-electric-vehicles-per-year/) (100% increase).

**2. Why think in Hyzon fundamentally?**

We are currently fully delved into COP26 global meetings and coverage in Glasgow, and it's absolutely clear that countries will start moving **towards decarbonising economies**, and **moving to cleaner energies**. As **HYZN establishes itself as a leader in this field**, and major investments globally are being shifted from carbon/diesel to electric/hydrogen, it would be worth a bet. The CEO of Hyzon confirmed they are present at COP26 and over the weekend Tweeted ""expect our vehicles to be a common sight around the world... wait for the updates!"". Today, 1st of November, HYZNs first hydrogen coach completed it's [first journey in Brisbane, Australia successfully.](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/HYZN/hyzon-motors-first-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-coach-on-the-roads-in-leynb6f2ztoi.html)

**I also ask the following questions fundamentally on hydrogen VS electric**: can our current electrical grids and infrastructure support such a major shift to electric without affecting and driving prices higher for maintenance &amp; demand? Do we not see more opportunity on hydrogen?

**3. The Technicals &amp; Price history:**

**MCAP:** 1.28 Billion

**Price:** 5.21$/share - 52 week low of 5.09$ - originally materialized via a SPAC.

**Revenue: PRE-REVENUE**. First revenue &amp; earnings on ***Friday 12th of November pre-market.***

**Total Outstanding Shares:** 247 Million

**Short Interest/Float: Not entirely clear.**

Two big hedge funds reported shorting this stock majorly: [Blue Orca](https://twitter.com/blueorcainvest/status/1442840492534861827?lang=en) and [Iceberg Research](https://iceberg-research.com/2021/10/06/hyzon-motors-inc-trouble-at-the-parentco/). When news hit the stock dumped +20% intraday for BO's report and a big percentage intra day as well when IR released. [However, HYZN came out VERY strongly dismissing the claims](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2021-10-05/fuel-cell-truck-maker-hyzon-rejects-short-seller-report-calls-its-inaccurate). HYZN CEO Craig Knight even [said in a podcast published days ago](https://twitter.com/NiclasVestlund/status/1454875680764829697) that HYZN didn't even bother releasing for the second Iceberg report - **as they'd rather let numbers speak on the 12th of November.** [CEO is extremely transparent on Twitter: posting very reassuring posts directly to investors.](https://twitter.com/CraigK_Hyzon/status/1451597498540339201) CTO of $HYZN is also extremely open and active on Twitter: [showing major progress of their presence in the Netherlands.](https://twitter.com/carlholthausen/status/1454172747584651266?s=21) The stock now heavily attracts negative press from law firms seeking to sue for damages given this short report. I believe Blue Orca did not imagine the power it's report would have. But we see action from the company fully contradict these reports.

Here a price chart of $HYZN. **We currently see bullish divergence on the daily timeframe**. And we currently have a **price gap between 8.5 and 9.2 dollars at a 75% increase level**.

Daily volume is about 1% of the stocks total shares - ***so it's liquid.***

&amp;#x200B;

**In addition to this, multiple price targets from other hedge funds remain extremely bullish, with an average upside of 15.5$ (200% ROE)..**. Although it is to be said most of these targets were prior to the short reports, so analysts are most likely waiting for the call on the 12th before updating their targets:

**So despite the price action being held against the progress of the stock, and baseless interpretations of short reports keep this stock plummeted, it is no wonder why I see value in this stock before it's first revenue call in about 2 weeks.** 

**I have 1475.62 shares at 5.22$:**

Welcome to the new trading month of November and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 1st, 2021-

*****

# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.
*****
&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.
*****
&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; In our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery, wrote Fundstrats Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. COVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.
*****
&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Traders Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.
*****
&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.
*****
&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.
*****
&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and Octobers jobs report.
*****
&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserves two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Feds comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.
*****
&gt; The Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that, Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. In a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.
*****
&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Managements manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from Septembers 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.
*****
&gt; The other big event for the week will be Octobers employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after Septembers meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.
*****
&gt; Key to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.

1,"11/01/2021, 19:51:55",Hey..i have 2 questions if anybody knows :),Jetola,"1) Cost to borrow, if that goes above 100%, what does that mean. If a stock cost $10, and the CTB is say 120% and i borrow it and sell it, i now have $10 in my bank account. But even if it goes to $1 after 1 year and i buy it back to profit $9 - i would still loose money because i have to pay $12 in fee...right ?..why is it that loans are still made with CTB over 100% it does not make sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Is it possible that a short player, can borrow stock but NOT sell it, just borrow it, pay the fee but never actually sell the stock. Then at some point depending on how things go, they can choose to sell it (i.e. go real short) or deliver it back, without having to buy it (because it was never sold) and the only loss was the fee they had to pay ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkca47/heyi_have_2_questions_if_anybody_knows/

Broderick  By Alex Philippidis - November 1, 2021",WallStBull10Point0,"INO-4800

Inovio has reported complete maintenance of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against all variants of concern tested, including Delta. The broad T-cell responses that we are generating with 4800 give us confidence that we can protect against the known variantsAlpha, Beta, Gamma, and Deltabut also potentially the as-yet-unknown future variants, Kate E. Broderick, PhD, senior vice president, R&amp;D, Inovio, told GEN.

INNOVATE will be conducted with Advaccine Biopharmaceuticals Suzhou, which holds exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize INO-4800 within Greater China. INNOVATE is set to recruit participants across Latin America, Asia, and Africa (numbers will vary depending on regional infection rate)though not the United States, where the trial remains on partial clinical hold because the FDA has raised questions about the Cellectra 2000 device used for delivering INO-4800.

We will be gathering data and look forward to working with the FDA to get off the hold, Broderick added.

1,"11/01/2021, 18:43:01",IonQ - the path to $100,boutros_haram,"Heres why I think shares wont stop until $100:

BCG (worlds 2nd largest strategy consulting firm) estimates that quantum computing could create value of $450 billion to $850 billion in the next 15 to 30 years.

We can attribute 15% of that to the computing platform, and keep in mind that the Apple App Store and other platforms charge significantly more.

$97.5bn revenue potential or addressable market at the middle of BCGs range. 

In cloud the market leader is AWS with 55% market share. Vastly superior error correction puts IONQ miles ahead of others and I expect them to capture up to half the market. But lets just say 40%. 

$97.5bn x 40% market share = $39bn revenue in 2040

Put that on a very conservative 10x multiple = $390bn enterprise value 

What are the odds of that playing out? Id say 5% is not crazy by any means. 

$390bn x 5% = $19.5bn.  Current market cap is just $2.9bn

6.7x upside = $101 price target 

Call me an idiot but I dont think this is wild for a game changing industry and business that will be crucial for the US.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1.5B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Overall, owning $COIN has been one long drawn out kick to the nuts.

It's 30% of my current net worth at $206,822.

Roughly six months after the fact, I'm breaking even, notwithstanding opportunity cost since. I'm glad I stuck with it. It is at 29.09 P/E as of writing, and still isn't being valued appropriate to its earnings or growth rates (PYPL @ 56.73 P/E?), so I think it has a lot of potential to run upward. But it has been a painful hold, and still might be.

I'm going to be leaving the cost basis where they are for now and start adding to other long-term holds (ARKG, APPL). After the painful experience with $COIN, I'm going to be much more cautious with large initial positions and DCA. 

I still like $COIN, aside from its awful support, I'm firmly convinced it will remain dominant if they continue to expand their offerings competitively.

1,"11/01/2021, 10:33:01",Options Update for Week of 5 NOV 21,StarSwitch,"u/StarSwitch back with a quick post on options plays that look very promising for the week. The methodology is purely quantitative and based around the hedging model I made. These are specific contracts I've identified as undervalued based on their moneyness (perceive  as risk). T**LDR: these contracts are priced for lower risk than my model shows. Betting on those odds converging generally wins.** If you want to know the general mechanic of the model, go read my other posts. I'm tired

First up: **DIS**. **Don't fuck with the mouse.** That said, DIS is down a bit (\~10%) from ATH but the options chain is set up very similar to a typical meme stock gamma squeeze. Sounds insane but the underlying volume associated purely with the hedging of DIS options is very high. This one is risky with earnings but the math checks. The odds have been diverging for the last week but a move to 173+ should get the ball rolling with some heavy upwards momentum. Dealer hedging is positive with the spot price up to $185. My positions **DIS 19 Nov 180-185c. Add 2 DEC** 

Second: **BABA**. Jack Ma is dead and China r fuk. Same deal here as DIS but the difference is larger. However BABA options hedging makes up a lesser portion of volume so the model is slightly weaker here. Dealer  is positive to $180 strike. Positions: **$175 3 DEC**

&amp;#x200B;

Update on SPY: Trading this model on SPY has made money hand over fist since August with all the volatility exacerbating error with options market prices, both up and down days. However now SPY is overextended where  neutral is at $455 strike. Now dealer hedging is resisting upwards movement. I'd take this opportunity for credit spreads **467c/470c** a week out where the 467 is over valued and 470 is undervalued directionally. My guess is SPY grinds slower in this channel if not an outright drop.This also hedges long market/Vol exposure of other positions.

Is it worth actually investing in BAT? 

Also BAT should increase with the amount of advertisers on Brave and the amount of users. So would could hyping this create run away situation? End up getting Brendan Eich on Rogan or something.

I mean, BAT is linked to the overall adoption of Brave. Brave, without BAT, is itself a good product. its use is in the low millions so has massive room for growth. 

Anyone with knowledge on BAT or ideas on its potential can you share some of that in the replys. Thanks

My assumption is that in 50-100 years these short position will be forced to climb by what i call the ""Species Level Threat"" Index. Meaning if we do nothing to stop climate change, we as a species will die, rendering not only our stocks worthless, but the dollar we use to purchase them.

If however our species finds a way to create sustainable green energy (Outside the realms of oil and coal) then they will take over the market by a firestorm, and at some point, boomer fuel stock will render itself obsolete (Which nets our shorts money)

They listed last year via a SPAC (I didn't think we were allowed to call them that anymore but whatever) so they have no debt and aren't well known to the market.

There's a few main things they do and they're all about to print money.
1) Aircraft storage and decommissioning/recommissioning- Tick, every airline has had planes parked up because of covid
2) Converting passenger aircraft to freighters - Huge tick, passenger flights have been hampered for two years while freight costs have gone vertical increasing demand for freighters
3) AerAware, flight vision system - It helps pilots land in shit weather and is just about to be certified by the FAA at which stage ASLE will probably announce they've got contracts to sell a fuckton of these things to airlines at a hefty margin.

They've given really conservative guidance which they are going to blow out of the water.

ASLE is up 30% this month and is primed to really explode, the few analysts that have tried to value them have price targets of $40+ by next year and they currently trade at $22. Volume is low so if a whole heap of apes bought April 22 calls it could lead to a huge grandma squeeze.

1,"11/01/2021, 07:55:16",My plan to make 1.6 Billion in 52 weeks with COST,MasterAndrey2,"Ok so here's the plan: 

Step one: Buy $2,000 in COST (Costco), buy a chain that will be able to make you at least 30% in one week. (I was able to make 33% in ONE day with COST.) 

Step Two: Sell it by Friday (does not HAVE to be Friday) If you were smart and made 30% on this you will now have $2600, this is good.

Step Three: Repeat, every Monday Yolo all your money on COST options to make 30% a week.

By using my algorithm:

`var starting = 2000;`

`var numWeeks = 52;`

`var expectedReturn = 0.3;`

`var perWeek = 0;`

`var totalCash = starting;`

&amp;#x200B;

`for(var i = 0; i &lt; numWeeks; i++){`

  `perWeek = totalCash * expectedReturn;`

  `totalCash += totalCash * expectedReturn:`

`}`

After 52 weeks (1 year for you retards) you should have 1,683,000,773 in cash. Continuing this you should become richer than Elon Musk. To finish this all you have to YOLO everything on TSLA calls and buy 100% of all MAAAM companies, becoming an actual Buy &amp; Large. You can pollute the world so badly that humans need to go to outer space. By providing services and products for them to buy you now control the entire economy. You have become a universal maniac. I realize now this is the plot of Wall-E. Doesn't matter your a quadrillionaire now so yeah. be sure to send me some money for these tips.

&amp;nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all had a fun weekend! Weve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning weve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though thats not to say that there isnt chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round. Lets get into it!

&amp;nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isnt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If youre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isnt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below Ive compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, well still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies whove already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. Theres no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&amp;nbsp;

- **$PINS is inefficiently priced.** $PINS has a priced move of 10.5% but a historical move of 15%, meaning we have edge in this trade. Pinterest is a historically aggressive mover, and thats only going to be amplified due to the awkward resolution of the Paypal deal, leading me to believe were going to have another large move this quarter. $PINS reports on Thursday, meaning that the options will be even cheaper due to theta, moving the 10.5% priced move closer to 8% or 9%, giving us added margins of safety.  For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to the link in the point above.$SNAP. 

&amp;nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity. So do $PENN and $DKNG.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if youre bullish or bearish on *either company*, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, well reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations youd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjyrik/historical_post_earnings_moves_mega_compilation/
1,"11/01/2021, 05:05:16",Why I Still like APPL,Immediate_Guidance_6,"A lot of naysayes in here with Appl. Their phones are becoming commodities with negligible upgrades, the prices are comming down, their eco system is under threat with a recent court ruling regarding monopolistic pricing with apps on their closed eco system. Their long awaited ventue into into cars is too late to the party and still to far away, if they even get it off the ground.

The Pipes vs. the Hardware. By pipes, I mean verizon, at&amp;t, and t-mobile.  They spend billions at auction to buy spectrum from the federal gov to send gsm, Lte, and cdma signals to your phone and now moving into the 5th generation. Appl provides the hardware, the carriers provide the pipes that bring it to the hardware.

The pipe carriers pay full price for Appl phones. Again, the carrier pays full price to appl for the phone.  Those prices you pay are subsidized by the carriers in the form of your 2yr contract. The carrier makes its money off the contract minus the amount it subsidizes to you the buyer. Thats why you get the subsidized price on your phone every 2ys on your contract with trade in. This is very lucrative  to both the carrier and to appl. A revolving 2yr annuity for the carrier, and short new purchase cycle for appl.

What if I told you appl is working on bypassing the carriers. Well, they are. They have already embedded in the 13 a qcom gx chip in addition to the development of the m1 that uses mvno tech to use multiple carriers at the same time. Goggle is already using this with google-fi in their own eco system.  Appl is already beta testing it's own version with the 13 in europe. This is just the first step. Appl is investing heavly in new satellite technologies to beam directly to your appl phone. There are those who say the speed is too slow and this can only be used in rual area's and in emergencies with no coverage.Tell that to Musk and his new venture into satellites.This technology is comming sooner than you think.I believe this is comming. The money that verizon, att, and t-mobile make, prints into the 100's of billions. Imagine if appl takes even a quarter of this away from each of them. Will appl control it's own pipe, and be it's own carrier. I think it will or a least on a quasi level 8n the not too distant future,  and it's printing gobs of money now while I wait. That's why I'm long. Thanks for reading. Good luck with your trades and investments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjyqgu/why_i_still_like_appl/

**PDUFA DECEMBER 23RD** **2021, LIBERVANT**

**Price Currently $5.14** 

**All time high $19.**

**Last Pdufa run $9. 2nd** **time around company stated much better chances as no more data is necessary. Furthermore they had 2 meetings with FDA giving them guidance since their last CRL in Sep 2020**

I am in not in any way any type financial advisor this is just my opinion for a company that I believe has a lot to offer.

Just to keep it simple for us here is the run down why I think this particular stock could possibly make a strong run and possibly even a potential Buy Out / Partnership in the making.

\-  **PharmaFilm Technology to sum it all up just Imagine of eliminating all oral pills, gels, injections etc. and making it a mouth strip exactly similar to Listerine Pocket Packs for fresh breath**. The film could be dissolved on your tongue, cheek etc. without all the toxins hurting your liver and body parts. Furthermore, it would even be effective faster. This is the delivery system AQST has been able to create. Putting drugs on film would benefits millions and millions of people. 

\-  MonoSol Rx which was Aquestive Therapeutics former name announced a Licensing Agreement back on Oct 06, 2016 with Lupin Pharmaceutical Inc. for multiple pediatric-focused products. Hmmm think about all the kids that dont like to take pills and medications in traditional delivery forms, just being able dissolve a film on their tongue. **Gamechanger here, imagine how much this would help.**

\-  Aquestive has **5 products already approved by the FDA** so Dec 23rd Pdufa date is something familiar to them. The company continues to report encouraging numbers for SYMPAZAN and they recently also announced a supply agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma to commercialize EXSERVAN in the United States.

\-  Aquestive reported Positive Topline Data from Phase 1 trail of AQST-109, the first and only orally delivered epinephrine product candidate. It demonstrated clinical results comparable to auto injectors, if this **could replace the EpiPen** just imagine the market size.

**Aquestive had a PDUFA for Libervant in September 2020, however they received a CRL from the FDA and then completed a Type A meeting with FDA November 2020. Furthermore, they received further guidance from the FDA in FEBURARY 2021, giving them 2 appearances with the FDA to guide them in the right direction.**

Aquestive stated based upon the Agencys guidance, the submission included additional statistical modeling and supporting analyses of the existing clinical data. The company continues to believe that no additional clinical studies will be required for FDA approval of LIBERVANT for U.S. market access.

1,"11/01/2021, 03:55:44",$RDW RDW is the space play that's fun and good for you.,CPLKiller13,"First off: My position 10 Dec 17, 21 $20 calls @ $1.80 

Long time lurker and never poster. Never had a reason to post but I think I found something the Apes will like. This is my first post and most likely will contain many errors. Feel free to make fun of me. I know I deserve it. 

I bought into RDW after the Blue Origin partnership announcement and after doing some research decided not to bail after it came back down to reality. I think the stock actually has legs and a lot of potential. 

A great video posted today goes over this much better than I did and if you want to watch it, it can be found on YouTube simply by searching for: Redwire Space Stock Overview (RDW)

TLDR: RDW is made up of different space companies that partnered up or were purchased to create one larger company to make space logistics and manufacturing a reality. They have a low public float, current positive cash flow, with cash flow and revenue expected to 10X by 2025.

&amp;#x200B;

Companies involved:

Adcole Space: Builds and test space parts and equipment, have been around since 1957. 

Deep Space Systems (DSS): System design and engineering, specializes in deep space operations. Set to provide payload delivery to the surface of the moon. Like UPS, but in space. 

Deployable space systems (DSSI): Specialize in Creating deployable solar arrays. Creating more reliable and durable arrays. 

Loadpath:  Satellite and space launch technologies. Create software for building and designing equipment that specifically relates to space. 

Made In Space: Develops and builds 3D printers for use in manufacturing in space. Already have equipment creating parts on the ISS. Make it so replacement parts for satellites and space stations can be made in space to cut the cost of shipping. IE, not having to make it on earth then being brought to space using expensive rockets.

Oakmen Aerospace: Develops space system architectures. 

Roccor: deployable antennas and solar arrays. Focus on removing junk from space and creating simple low cost solutions for satellites.

Orbital Reef: Blue Origins, low earth orbit private space station. Trying to save the world with space magic. 

 

Financials 

$280M backlog. With wide Market applications. Current market cap of about $750M.

Achieved cash flow positive in 2020. Expected to almost 10X its cash flow by 2025. Revenue is currently $118M, expected to be $1.5B by 2025.

Comparing it to other companies in the space (see what I did there) it has a low Market cap with already positive revenue and is cash flow positive

&amp;#x200B;

Other Companies are focused on getting to space and RDW is focused on what we are going to do when we get there. In other words, how to make space profitable. This is something I have been preaching about privately for years. Imagine a time when Space freighters and Mining Stations are a thing of daily life. Most want to just jump right to the romanticized idea of Interstellar space travel but forget it starts with people doing basic tasks made hard by them being in space. I am excited about the future of space as a business opportunity. RDW is tackling a wide variety of problems specific to space and making it a place where we can build sustainable economic ecosystems. 

If you ask me questions I'm not be able to answer because of my low Karma, so just be patient and ill get to anything as soon as I can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjxcuf/rdw_rdw_is_the_space_play_thats_fun_and_good_for/

Another big earnings week coming up, but im seeing a big lack of discussion around Activision Blizzard. Im not a gay bear, but holy fuck theres no way theyre gonna go up during this call.




1. The Lawsuit:

This is the big one, ATVI had to settle for a bunch of money recently, but the State of California is still continuing their suit on a massive sexual harassment case in the company.

This has caused many players to totally leave the games




2. Declining Playerbase:

I was a big Blizzard fan, I dont care about the lawsuit, their games are just shit. Lets talk about them.

- WoW: currently down the shitter (used to be my No. 1 game), absolutely getting crushed by shit content AND New World has yoinked a massive amount of the playerbase (including myself)

- Overwatch: Who the fuck plays this anymore lmao

- StarCraft: Who the fuck plays this anymore lmao

- Diablo: actually had a release of Diablo 2 Remastered, but to Zero Hype

- Hearthstone: lmao no hype around this anymore




3. BlizzCon:

got cancelled hahahahahahahahahahhah



4. Activision:

I think they have WarZone and mediocre Vanguard beta reviews





TL/DR:

Blizzard is shit at the moment, with bad games, declining players and a big lawsuit over the past quarter. BUY PUTS ON ATVI YEEEEEEHAW",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjxana/atvis_time_to_tank/

1,"11/01/2021, 03:34:12",Pinterest DD. 23 - 34% upside potential for this week,aleksandar321,"**TLDR:**

* Upside potential of 23 - 34% by Friday for Pinterest (PINS) - without calculating the **apes together strong** effect;

* Not financial advice;

**I. Introduction - Why is PINS -34% YTD**

1. Apple's disruptive changes to iOS slowed down ads revenue for social media platforms.
1. The biggest reason for this selloff is the slowdown in monthly active users for Pinterest in Q2 2021 (-5% since Q1 2021). Wallstreet saw this as a potential slow down and a turning point for Pinterest, which scared them - hence the stock market. (*data taken from their Q2 10-Q form*)

**II. Why do I think PINS has an upside potential of 23 - 34% by Friday?**

        A) Point one:

**1. Pinterest's business model differs from the industry specifics**

   Pinterest is a visual discovery engine that people use **to find inspiration**. Most of their revenue is generated by running ads on their web and mobile apps. Analysts wrongly compare Pinterest and classify it as a Social media. They do so because almost all of the social media's revenue is generated by ads and it is always easier to compare a company's performance to that of a competitor: Fb (*or should I say meta?*), Twitter, Snapchat.

**But that is just wrong!** You go to meta apps, insta and snapchat to chat with your friends and see their posts and annoying ads pop up trying to be relevant. Pinterest is all about looking for inspiration, planning your next project, home or garden improvements, deliciously looking meal, or clothing, etc. You go there looking for something, you search what you are interested in, ads are now more relevant, in fact, you are willing to look into ads because most likely you are looking to purchase something anyway.

**2. Apple's changes to privacy affect ads revenue for various companies. But shouldn't affect Pinterest**

Apple made a change to iOS double asking if you are okay with apps to track your data. Apple also came up with a feature built into safari to hide your IP address making it impossible for companies like Meta to match your internet activity on other websites with YOU.

Companies like Meta, Twitter, and Snapchat apart from analyzing your interests based on their in-app activity, rely heavily on tracking your activity on other websites and apps as well. Contrary to this model, as I stated previously, Pinterest doesn't need to know which websites you visited to drive ads revenue up. You are searching for your interest in their app anyways.

During Snapchat's Q3 earnings their CEO mentioned that they didn't anticipate that Apple's privacy changes would be so disruptive. The market reacted by:

* Pinterest: -5.36%
* Snapchat: -26.59% (have in mind they missed analyst expectations, which also has an impact)
* Twitter: -4.83%
* Meta: -5.05%

Due to the nature of their app and content, I believe the impact on Pinterest's bottom line won't be as big as the rest of the industry experienced. And here is data taken directly from companies' 10-Q reports to back it up:



Company | Q2 2021 ARPU*| Q3 2021 ARPU*| Growth latest Q YoY
---|---|----|----
Pinterest| USD 1.32| -| 88.57%
Snapchat| USD 3.35| USD 3.49| 27.84%
Twitter| USD 5.78**| USD 6.07**| 13.04%
Meta| USD 10.12| USD 10.00$| 26.74

^*ARPU ^stands ^for ^Average ^Revenue ^Per ^User

^**Twitter ^report ^Monetizable ^Daily ^Active ^Usage ^(mDAU). ^Calculated ^at ^Revenue/mDAU

Looking into the numbers, we can see the slower growth for Twitter, Snapchat, and Meta.

         B) Point two:

**1. Monthly active users is not as beneficial for Pinterest to grow revenue**

To be profitable and have future growth potential, Meta, Twitter, Snapchat, and other social media platforms need to grow their users as a **first priority**! At the end of the day- if your friends aren't using Instagram (for example) there is no reason for you to use it either. Pinterest won't find itself in the same situation. While growing an active user base results in higher revenue, it is not the main factor for Pinterest's perspective growth. People using Pinterest don't need their friends to be on the platform.

Simply growing Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is significant to make great earnings for the shareholders. And looking at the last table, Pinterest has had a massive increase in its monetization per user compared to the rest of the social networks. Additionally, taken from their 10-Q form for Q2 in 2021, international users account for 80% of all users on Pinterest, but their average revenue is just 0.36$ compared to 5.08$ for users in the US. And the company has started growing its partnerships in Europe to increase the revenue coming from Europe, just like they have done in the states.

**Contra argument - You don't visit Pinterest every day like other social networks**

You go to Pinterest when you are planning something new and need ideas. You go to Snapchat and Twitter every day (*and hopefully you don't go to any meta product unless it is Instagram becasue you follow litquidity**)*. Therefore revenue per customer for more frequently used platforms should be higher.

True! And looking at the data in the table above proves it. However, a user on Pinterest willingly consumes more ads, making it easier to grow average revenue per customer.

**2. Pinterest is oversold based on Price to Sales and Forward Price to earnings (relative to competitors)**



Data| Pinterest| Snapchat| Twitter| Meta
---|---|----|----|----
Forward P/E*| 42.22| 92.59| 37.31| 23.15
P/S**| 13.09| 23.47| 9.05| 7.85
Active Users| 459m| 528m| 396m | 2797m

^*Forward ^P/Es ^based ^on ^Friday ^29th ^Oct ^close.

^**P/S ^based ^on ^Friday ^29th ^Oct ^close; ^For ^the ^past ^12 ^months

Meta and Twitter's price ratios are lower representing their slower future growth anticipation. However, comparing Pinterest and Snapchat based on value and revenue- Pinterest is twice as cheap while both companies have strong growth potential in the short, mid, and long run.

**3. MD&amp;A on the negative growth in monthly active users**

During the Q2 earnings call, Pinterest executives attributed the negative growth in active users to lockdown easings around the world and discussed that the users who left the platform weren't very active in the first place. This could be confirmed by looking into their 10-Q form for Q2 where they reported the impressive 29% growth in Average Revenue Per User Q1 to Q2 (**growth that other social media platforms generate on annual basis**).

**4. Pinterest's future**

Pinterest has the most sophisticated visual search engine to date. Pinterest apps allow you to search based on text, it automatically identifies different objects on every picture which you could be interested in. It allows you to select a specific area you are interested in and search for it (which is different! images have metadata, a concrete area in the image wouldn't make use of an image's metadata). They have browser extensions so you could save an image on any website and search for it later. **In fact, when I see a product I like, I search it on Pinterest to find similar products potentially cheaper**.

I am not a visionary person, so the future of this visual discovery engine is beyond my ability to grasp. But it is hard to miss the fact and tendency that we consume and learn increasingly more through visual content. Actually, beyond that, such object detection AI is vastly applicable. In fact, your future Tesla has a variation of such sorts of software.

**III. Bottom line: I like the stock**

Look around yourself and take a moment to appreciate the things you have done and the ideas you came up with courtesy of Pinterest. They call Pinterest a social media, but in fact, social media like Instagram fill people with insecurities as opposed to Pinterest which fills you with joy, and truly helps you come up with your greatest ideas.

For all of that, I own 310 shares of Pinterest and 2 call options. Waiting for Monday to purchase more calls.

So my trading philosophy has been simple: keep my cash in ETFs, usually 50% in an S&amp;P 500 ETF and 50% in an investment grade fixed income ETF (depending on the market I will re-weight those allocations), and once I see a clear opportunity to buy, I buy. And WSB has helped me find those opportunities. I've maybe made 6-7 buys over the past 2 years, including:

* Snowflake @ the dip (bought around $200)
*  Luckin coffee @ about $2
* Tesla @ $200
* Shopify @ $350

Granted, I haven't held all of these stocks to their peaks because of my paper thin hands, but have nonetheless made some good profits. And I owe that to the collective information on this forum.

Now, I want to survey the forum here. What stocks do you think will flourish in 2021 and 2022? Where can I turn my $$ into $$$$? Trying to retire and find a trophy wife, but need your help. What stocks I should spend my limited time researching?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjwic5/next_best_opportunity/

1,"11/01/2021, 02:56:23",Fastly ($FSLY) seems to be losing lots of employees - earnings next week,Hour_Amphibian1844," Note: this is NOT a DD, Im not very familiar with Fastlys business and have no special insights into their customers or revenue. I just figured I could share my findings since I already did the digging.

Fastly has been tremendously beaten down as a stock already due to a series of bad news. The company (and analysts) are expecting just 15-20% growth in the upcoming quarter and years, down from regular 40% growth in the past. Their outage in June 2021 cost them several customers (by their own admission), and the stock is down almost 60% from its ATH. As such, bearish options are typically quite dangerous, but I did notice that a suspiciously high amount of employees seem to be leaving the company recently (since spring 2021). This COULD be a sign that more bad news are to be expected from the company in their upcoming report. 

**Regular employees**

Since March 2021, the number of people leaving the company has jumped to historically extremely high levels (April 2020 is a Covid outlier  5 people left, 4 were hired, making it stand out on the graph even though not much actually happened). They havent added net employees since March, and are currently losing more employees each month than they are hiring. As you can see in the second graph, hiring hasnt necessarily slowed down, but a lot more employees seem to be leaving the company (October 2020 is again an outlier due to their acquisition of Signal Sciences). They have historically lost 4-6 employees each month, suddenly spiking up to 19-27 each of the past 6 months.

All of this isnt necessarily a bad sign, it could be a sign of restructuring or layoffs for profitability that will make the company stronger. But such stagnation is a bit unusual for a tech company that has until recently been billed a growth stock. Anecdotally, a lot of recent reviews on Glassdoor are complaining about negative company developments and a lack of vision resulting in many talented people leaving. I dont usually pay attention to Glassdoor but combined with the actual data it seems noteworthy.

**Executives**

Ive also noticed what seems like an unusual number of executives leaving the company in the past months  a surprising number of them without having another job lined up. Were they fired due to low performance? That could be good for the company. Or are they trying to leave a sinking ship? That would be bad. Heres a list of everyone who has left since April 2021:

  

https://preview.redd.it/tl4fizh2ztw71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=457a2662244d3cf6d9aad812446909c365176700

&amp;#x200B;

VP seems to denote an N-2 position at Fastly (people who report to the C-suite, not the CEO directly). The C suite itself is very small (8 people) and, with the exception of the CFO, no recent departures there. So I wouldnt call this a massive exodus yet, but its definitely a somewhat strange number of high-level departures in just a few months. I could find just 5 VP level (or higher) departures in the entire time November 2019  March 2021. 

**Conclusion and plays**

I have to stress that 1) expectations for Fastly are already quite low, 2) none of the above is \*necessarily\* a bad sign. It could be that Fastly is making the right choices to streamline staff and set themselves up for success. I mostly wanted to share this as info for anyone thinking of making a play on Fastly either way. 

Anecdotally, FSLY is kind of a covid stock (their revenue is usage-based), many of which have recently gotten punished during earnings. Many of their customers benefitted from high traffic during Covid (incidentally, Amazon and Shopify, two big Fastly customers, just reported underwhelming numbers in terms of GMV/retail revenue), although e.g. Ticketmaster is also one of their customers and is obviously doing great right now. IV is very high at almost 7% so if I end up playing this (not sure yet) it will probably be as a bear spread. 

Sidenote: Ive been playing with [this website](https://www.cdnplanet.com/) to try and find some actual data on Fastlys usage. Maybe someone here with technical knowledge has a brilliant idea on how to help turn that into actual DD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjw4pq/fastly_fsly_seems_to_be_losing_lots_of_employees/

Unless the economy is eternally growing, the stock market is no different than sports gambling (or a psychology game considering how crazy speculative things have become lately). When you buy low and sell, high, someone else will have bought high and sold low, that's just the way it is. So best case scenario, you're rich and living a comfortable jobless life while stealing other people's money and being of no use to society. Worst case scenario, you're getting you money stolen from you by rich people that are of no use to society.

1,"11/01/2021, 02:07:58",Charitable donations: Better managing donations and charitable tax deductions,FinalDevice,"Alright, it's getting close to the end of the year. If you're lucky, 2021 saw a lot of gains (remember, the whole GME thing started in January). If you're like me, you promised to give away some of those gains and haven't done it yet.

If you've closed out all your positions it might be too late for this. But, there are two reasons that rich people give for evading taxes. 1, they don't like how the government spends money and they'd rather control where the money goes. 2, they think if they invest and grow that money it will be worth far more later, and they can make a greater contribution later in life.

Here's a way you can achieve either of those goals (like a rich person) while still giving money to a good cause or two (don't be the kind of rich person you don't like). It's called a Charitable Donor-Advised Fund. Most large brokerages offer this (but not RobinHood).

Let's assume you turned $100k into $1M this year, and you are still holding the stocks but plan to sell before the end of the year. Let's assume you planned to donate $100k to charity. If you sell your whole position, you have $900k in gains. You donate $100k to charity and pay 40% in taxes on $800k of the gains, leaving $580k in your account. 

Now let's do that differently. Before selling your whole position, you transfer $100k worth of stock into a donor-advised giving fund. Then you sell everything. Now you only have $810k in gains, because $90k of the capital appreciation was realized after it was already donated to charity. Additionally, you still have a $100k charitable deduction, so you pay 40% taxes on $710k in gains, leaving $616k in your account.

By donating appreciated stock, you can either keep more of your money (by paying less in taxes), or you can donate more to charity. Additionally, you now have the option of either continuing to invest money in that donor-advised fund, or distributing it to non-profit organizations as you see fit.

There are other ways to donate appreciated stock to charity, but IMO a donor-advised fund is the easiest. Also, I know the 40% tax rate may or may not be realistic but it was a nice easy number. TL;DR do what you want with your money, but if you want to give it away, donating appreciated stock lets you give more to charity instead of to taxes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjv4ph/charitable_donations_better_managing_donations/

1,"11/01/2021, 00:41:13",Amgen $AMGN faces massive market disruption with potential new blockbuster anemia treatment  ,Coyote0fWallstreet,"For years, Amgen has controlled a vast swath of the multi billion dollar anemia treatment market with their drug Aranesp, an injection based treatment that racked in over 1.5B dollars for the company last year

For the last decade, several companies have been in the race to create a new standard of anemia treatment, a less invasive oral drug that solves the same problems as Aranesp, but can be taken at home with just the swallow of a pill.

The front runners in this race have been Fibrogen and Akebia Therapeutics For a while it seemed as though Fibrogen was leading the charge, however, an FDA Adcom early this year sent their stock price plummeting from over $40 to just over $10, and gave Akebia the chance to secure the market. The FDA stated that Fibrogens drug had not proven its safety profile, and had too many accounts of adverse cardiovascular problems. Akebias drug Vadadustat seems like it outperforms Fibrogens drug on the safety profile, and also has proven to be non inferior to Amgens drug. Unlike Fibrogen, Akebias anemia drug gradually increases hemoglobin, whereas Fibrogens causes massive spikes, leading to overproduction, and inadvertently heart issues. This key difference gives Akebia a good chance at approval, especially considering the drug is already approved and marketed in Japan.

Akebia has a PDUFA date set for march of 2022, and signs seem to be pointing towards approval, especially since they have been in close dialogue with the FDA throughout their clinical trials and application. Akebia also expects EU approval in May of 2022Approval could not have come at a better time, seeing that Akebia has a market cap of less than $500M. This is absurd, seeing as though they make $250M a year through their other marketed drugs, and have another $250M cash on hand.

With Akebia likely to gain approval for Vadadustat, it will surely take over most of Amgens sales This means one of two things: either Akebia will be bought out, or it will rack in over a billion in revenue a year, likely to grow with the market This values Akebia Therapeutics much higher than its current price of $3 a share (500M market cap) and much closer to $15 a share ($2.5B in market cap) or perhaps even more This is a lights out buy opportunity, and several institutions have already jumped on bored, owning over 60% of the company Im all in, and am open to ANY reason why this is not 100% worth the slight risk it comes with ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjtcpt/amgen_amgn_faces_massive_market_disruption_with/

# Company and sector overview

*Let's talk about Ess Tech Inc. aka $GWH aka a new iron battery company supported by the one and only Sean Paul. I mean Bill Gates.No , let's talk about the sector first. Our boy Bill gates has been known recently for encouraging people to invest in climate tech.*

***""Bill Gates says climate tech will produce 8 to 10 Teslas, a Google, an Amazon and a Microsoft""-CNBC***

*For the ones outsmarted by Gates statements ,let me make it easier for you.For now climate tech is an interesting but undervalued play and that is mainly because everything develops so fast that you can't really get the point of it..Maybe you didn't really understand the potential of this sector.I'm from Europe , here in europe several cities have already  announced to ban fossil fueld cars in the next 10 years.What does this mean ? This means that the demand for EV will be higher than ever before. That's also one of the reasons Elon Musk built one of the biggest factories in the world right near Berlin.But EVs are kinda old news right?Everyone know about Tesla's massive bull run or Lucid or NIO ,but you have to see the bigger* *picture.Why would someone still refuse to buy an electric car , which is stronger than an fossil fueled one , makes litteraly no noises, is high-tech and costs close to 0$ to get a full ""tank"" ?* ***Because of the range***\*.The range depends on the batteries and how efficient and powerful these are.And that is the main point i want to prove.This sector isn't only about the cars, it's about the batteries. There is an ongoing war for batteries like never before  and that is because every company tries to beat the other.\* ***Read the photo below from a Barron's article***

&amp;#x200B;

[Barron's on battery supremacy ](https://preview.redd.it/n8iiep7actw71.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=603b31265e199fabf523e2c5a97e970a4e61b94c)

&amp;#x200B;

[Barron's latest magazine cover, increasing interest in the sector.](https://preview.redd.it/e09lu8khctw71.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02d95a39572fc99c003fe95d22fe0590f6d6e235)

&amp;#x200B;

*Now let's get back to our company. Ess Technology $GWH.* [*ESS Inc*](https://essinc.com/) \*is a manufacture of low-cost long-duration energy storage systems and  went public via reverse merger.\**Iron flow battery manufacturer ESS Inc. has been in the news lately, most recently for releasing an updated version of its product guarantee.*

*Munich RE, one of the worlds largest reinsurance companies, also updated its insurance policy for ESS to address customer concerns over technology risk. ESS told that the new policy covers the battery modules and electrolyte management system, as well any needed repairs or replacement for the first 10 years of the systems life. ESS manufactures these components itself.The products pump and motor drives have an expected lifetime of 19-22 years. The industrial computer, which was described as inexpensive, can be expected to be replaced every 5-7 years. ESS offers an O&amp;M service contract after the 10-year mark.*

*But even more striking is the batterys expected longevity. Much like the grids oldest assets, (some of which were first built in the 1890s), ESS batteries show the potential to soldier on for many decades. While the ESS battery systems have a prescribed design life of 25 years, the battery modules, electrolyte, plumbing, and other components may well last for decades longer with proper maintenance.*

*For one thing, the battery is expected to experience zero degradation over 20,000 cycles. By design, iron flow batteries circulate liquid electrolytes to charge and discharge electrons using a process called a redox reaction, which represents a gain of electrons (reduction), and a loss of electrons (oxidation). ESS uses the same electrolyte on both the negative and positive sides, eliminating possible cross-contamination and degradation. As a result, ESS chemistry remains stable for an almost unlimited number of deep-cycle charge and discharge cycles.*

*Another reason for the expected long operating life is that ESS batteries use a proton pump to balance and maintain electrolyte health over the life of the asset.*

*The pump connects to the tank and passively mixes unwanted hydrogen back into the solution. Doing so maintains the balance of pH and states of charge in the liquid electrolyte circulating through the system.*

*In human terms, the battery is the heart, the electrolyte is the blood, and the proton pump is the kidney, which keeps everything in balance.*

*The pump itself is expected to be a key commercial differentiator for ESS. Other flow chemistries need to come offline regularly to rebalance their electrolytes. Not so with the ESS design.*

***The company currently offers two products, the single shipping container Energy Warehouse and a string of warehouse units in an Energy Center.***

# Where things get personal

*We have come to a point were we have to get personal. So i am 99% sure u didn't read all that because me neither.The thing is that Ess is not designed for the auto industry NOW but the increasing trend in the battery sector will make this stock skyrocket.The fact that Ess is able to create iron batteries that offer a mid duration energy storage is something revolutionary.*

*Because it's important to save the best for the lest let me tell you a secret.Because the stock was only listed on 11 Oct and due to the share lock the float is only at 4.2M and yes , there are options available , you degenerate gamblers. That's insanely low. Now listen to me guys , i might not be bill gate but when such a low float gets interest it rockets skyhigh.*

&amp;#x200B;

[Float Information from the latest 8-K](https://preview.redd.it/80lqrgioctw71.png?width=268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91239c105c06fcf91f86144205d34a226a10048d)

*And it did rocket once , going from 8 dollars to 28. This happened 2 weeks ago and was done without WSB. Now considering all the plays that there have been , almost 99% of them don't skyrocket just once after going public. Remember QS , remember Ironnet.*

*This week will be crucial for this play. I'm in not only for the float play , but for the long game because i really see future in this company , and not only me. The fact that they are backed by Bill Gates and Softbank keeps them busy make me throw my savings into them*

&amp;#x200B;

*It wouldn't be surprising to see it have a run like Ironnet and QS. Though, any huge run in the stock will likely be short lived as all the other similar setups have seen. That really depends upon the lockups and share structure post merger which should became more clear in the near future.*

*Now look guys, i'm mad i missed the tesla run , as well as the GME run , but it's time to create a new opportunity. I stand by what bill gates said , tesla is the first , but not the last. In a matter of time there will be the second and the third tesla. TBH i would be more happy to throw 1000$ long term and losing them than missing 25.0000% potential gains.*

# Popularity

*The fact that i'm  not the only one who sees potential in this gives me a great confirmation.Lately a lot of twitter gurus approached $GWH. This and all the attention gained from Barron's and WSJ articles really makes me realise this stock is more bullish than my dick on viagra*

I know this is a risky play but I'm submitting a request for a flair change of my choice. You can wait till later this month, but please consider...Double Birds...thank you. *see explanation at the end*

Ok on to the Double Down. I'm back with this three ape flair to tell you to consider starting a position in Rocket Lab(RKLB). Do some due diligence yourselves, but I'll give you an interesting exercise. Look at the chart, see that it's hit a high of +$21 and has since pulled back 40%. Look what day that latest low was. Then check my past comments to see if I made an interesting observation(I said it around 12:30pm if you're that curious).

It's a holiday so I'm going to keep this short, there's plenty to see in my comments. Some sobering facts and some wild speculation. And yeah...I might be a little hooked.

So recently New Zealand has eased its covid restrictions and Rocket Lab plans on getting back to launching. **November 11th-24th** is their next launch window. The way those work is they keep a broad window, but try to launch on the earliest day with the best weather conditions. They also have a second launch planned shortly after, this will be their first attempt at such a fast cadence. Squeezed in their is a quarterly report on the **15th**. This quarter they were in lockdown so you bears might want to sit at the card table with me. I still believe they will spin positive news from a recent US Space Force contract to pay for about an 1/8 of the cost of their next rocket they're designing. Also acquisition which bolsters the company's Space Systems capabilities. So it's hard to see how this will go.

Some analysis. The volume has been incredibly low this week, and the price has still trended up slowly. An increase in volume will push this price like last time, but I'm not sure which way. I choose up. Daily RSI may be driving the decisions of the institutions holding this stock, currently it's a few points above 50...sorry I didn't post this sooner. Don't everyone enter the capsule at once, this week may still have some slight dips.

Disclosure: I have a combination of shares and warrants that are  a little north of 10,000. I have a few dozen November  and December calls as well($15)....[It's a Sunday, you have time to research](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/)

*The reason I like Double Birds is because of this cautious risk taker named Joseph ""Red"" Kittenger.  He sort of symbolizes my current tolerance in the market. I just came across a video of his famous high altitude jump in 1960. I've read and watched a lot on the guy over the years, but this is the first time I saw something I never saw before. It happens at the end of [this](https://youtu.be/Qw8OJJQ_hgk) video. Other versions of this video cut out this part at the end. You'll notice the guy helping him out of his equipment flash Red the double birds before giving him a friendly slap on the cheek. That's one of those ""picture worth a million words"" moments*

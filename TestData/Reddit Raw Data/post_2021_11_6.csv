Maybe some wrinkled brains here can help me understand this situation.

So with what's going on around with GME right now, people everywhere trying to DRS their shares trying to lock up the float.

There has to be a minimum amount of float for there to be options to buy and sell right?

I've read somewhere it's around 4 to 7 mil shares.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo34zn/locking_up_the_float_and_options/

Okay so this is gonna sound really retarded at first, but just hear me out.
So anyone who holds $GmE knows that lives r going to change forever after the MOASS, and Ive been thinking about what the aftermath might be like, and where it could potentially go from there.

I havent really seen any big ideas or proposals make sense for any of us to pursue after the MOASS; But that changes today, Because we now have a rough outline for GameStop The Nation-State

We know the price is wrong, we know that GameStop is a multi-trillion dollar company, and we know that theres close to a million heavily invested apes that may or may not be interested in developing a nation powered by GameStop.

This may sound ridiculous, and it absolutely is, but i have faith in our cognitively limited smoothbrains, and believe we can find a plausible route to becoming an internationally recognized government led by Emperor Ryan Cohen.

Now building a new country from scratch may pose some logistical problems, but I believe we can figure this shit out. After the MOASS well easily have enough bananas to afford an island/large area of open land to develop on. 

Our national currency will of course be $GME token, and by the time we finish constructing our banana utopia, GameStop will most likely be selling groceries, power tools, jetskis etc. So the only commercial store well ever need is GameStop. 

I could go into more detail about my outlines and projections if anyone is interested in this concept. I truly believe theres enough apes and enough resources to pull this off. 

If youre having trouble wrapping ur head around this idea, try utilizing $THC as an aphrodisiac to open ur mind to the possibility of the Democratic Gorillas Republic of GameStop

Berkshire Hathaway beat analysts' expectations on earnings and revenues but missed on operating earnings.

Gains on its investment portfolio were down YOY, but operating earnings from all segments except insurance were up.

Insurance posted a larger underwriting loss than in Q3 2020.

Revenues increased YOY across business segments, reflecting the conglomerate's broad exposure to the economic recovery.

Berkshire Hathaway Earnings Results

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) Financial Results: Analysis

Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (BRK.A) reported Q3 FY 2021 earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. Earnings per share (EPS), while down by 63.8% year over year (YOY), were 15.7% better than analysts' forecasts. Revenue for the quarter exceeded analysts' estimates by 15.2%, despite being down by 0.4% year over year (YOY).

Berkshire Hathaway recorded a pretax net gain of $4.9 billion on investments and derivative contracts that was included in the revenue figure cited in the table above. This was down by 84.5% from the figure of $31.6 billion recorded in the same period of 2020.2 On an after-tax basis, the gain was $3.9 billion, down by 84.2% from $24.7 billion in Q3 2020.

Operating earnings, which exclude these gains, were $6.5 billion, compared to $5.5 billion in the same quarter of 2020. This was an improvement of 18.2% YOY but 7.1% below the estimates. The operating earnings figures that Berkshire reports in the notes to its SEC Form 10-Q and in its earnings release are calculated after income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.

Berkshire has not made a large outside acquisition since its purchase of Precision Castparts in 2016, but it has continued extensive share repurchases (stock buybacks) as a means to distribute its huge cash hoard to shareholders. It bought back approximately $7.6 billion in stock in Q3, bringing the total for the first nine months of 2021 to about $20.2 billion.

Over the past year, through the market close on Nov. 5, 2021, Berkshire Hathaway's shares have provided a total return of 39.1%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500's total return of 33.8%.

BRK.A Operating Earnings

For many years, Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett has urged investors to focus on Berkshire's operating earnings from its diversified lineup of wholly owned operating subsidiaries, which stretch across a broad spectrum of industriesmost notably insurance, railroads, utilities, and energy. However, as of result of recent changes to GAAP reporting rules, the quarterly mark-to-market fluctuations in the value of Berkshire's investment portfolio must be reflected on the company's income statement, a rule that Buffett has decried as introducing misleading volatility into the company's reported financial results.

Operating revenues increased from $63.0 billion in Q3 FY 2020 to $70.6 billion in Q2 FY 2021, an improvement of 12.1%. Meanwhile, operating expenses rose by 11.2% YOY, from $57.0 billion to $63.4 billion.

The biggest drivers of the $7.6 billion YOY improvement in operating revenues came from an increase of $2.3 billion from Berkshire's manufacturing segments, $1.9 billion from insurance, and a $1.4 billion improvement in its service and retailing segments. Its railroad and energy segments also posted YOY revenue gains, reflecting the conglomerate's widespread participation in the economic expansion.

As noted above, after-tax operating earnings of $6.5 billion represented an improvement of 18.2% from the same period in 2020. However, insurance underwriting was a drag on results, posting a loss of $784 million in Q3 2021, versus a loss of $213 million in Q3 2020. Insurance investment income was up by 14.4% YOY; railroad, utilities, and energy by 10.6%; and ""other businesses"" (manufacturing, services, and retailing) by 15.3%. ""Other"" (which includes goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charges) swung from a loss of $412 million in Q3 2020 to a profit of $349 million in Q3 FY 2021.

Berkshire Hathaway's next earnings report (for Q4 FY 2021 and the annual report for FY 2021) is expected to be released on Feb. 26, 2022.6 A highlight of each annual report is Warren Buffett's accompanying annual letter to shareholders, which traditionally is eagerly anticipated by investors in general, not just Berkshire shareholders.

Why Lumen Technology **LUMN**, will run soon as investors realize what the **intrinsic value** is in this company. There is a **hidden catalyst** that will be occurring in the near future, which makes this an excellent **value stock** to hold.   Not only that but, they are a recipient of the 60M broadband package from the infrastructure bill, so they'll benefit!  If you don't care about the backstory of Lumen, then skip to the TLDR or read the why invest in Lumen portion and the Catalyst.

# What is LUMN?

In the early 2000s or late 90s two companies were laying a bunch of sub C fiber from New York to Spain and across the Atlantic and across the Pacific. It was Level 3 and Global Crossing because of the idea that theres going to be this huge internet they would need all this connectivity thats connecting continents.

Unfortunately, Global Crossings overbuilt and went bankrupt at the time. There was just a lot of mess, but lo and behold years and years later, guess what? The internet is bigger than anyone ever thought. And so Level 3 was a roll-up that included Level 3s assets, Global Crossing, and Time Wire Telecom. Level 3 now owns what we would call domestic US fiber underground connecting end points across the world.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2002/01/29/global-crossing-files-for-bankruptcy/fffcad1b-f522-479a-a9d4-659e74165b05/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2002/01/29/global-crossing-files-for-bankruptcy/fffcad1b-f522-479a-a9d4-659e74165b05/)

Lumen is the name for a merged entity between Level 3 and CenturyLink. Level 3 is the company that holds the hidden value in LUMN. Currently Level 3 is 1/3 of the new entity and CenturyLink's dying business model is what's hurting the market value.

# Cove Street Investors

The investors fell in love with Jeff Storey the CEO of Level 3. If you look into Jeff Storey it appears that he was set to replace the CEO Glen Post of CenturyLink whom was retiring shortly. The investors from Cove Street were **weary of the management team at CenturyLink** and told Jeff, this is not a group of people they felt confident with and don't necessarily think they understood what they're buying. However, the old CEO Glen Post of CenturyLink stayed on as a board member directing the company until January 2020 [https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/former-ceo-post-steps-down-from-centurylink-s-board-directors](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/former-ceo-post-steps-down-from-centurylink-s-board-directors). **The investor worry has proven to be the case.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5ba1ok28uzx71.jpg?width=847&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28d7490944ee57d1bac16f63e2b505217ed033eb

# What was the impetus for the merger and why is CenturyLink such a big portion of the new business?

Level 3 was offered a lot of money. The Level 3 shareholders were happy to take the premium that was offered. The investors **sold out**, as soon as they realized that the surviving entity would be controlled by Glen Post. The reason why the combined company is predominantly CenturyLink is because it was at the time a **$17 billion revenue company.** This was not a tiny entity by any means.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/40bzsssruzx71.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93eccc85adac2444cc16ddb0e087b8daf64f750f

It was larger only in the end profit sense than Level 3. However, the **actual valuation was skewed towards Level 3** This is basically a company that was trading at, lets say, five times buying a company that was trading at 12 times. The people who get screwed are the shareholders of the company thats trading at five times. Shareholders of Level 3 didnt care because everyone was getting a fantastic value for their investment and the CenturyLink shareholders, well, they took it in the pants.

Thats exactly what the pitch was to the CenturyLink board when they discussed the acquisition. Currently, it is also still a truism to say that while it is a **melting ice cube**, the ice cube is melting at, lets say, three to 5% a year on a cash flow basis. And the good side, the **Level 3 side is growing**.

So you have a **global growing asset heavy, almost irreplaceable asset business in Level 3** and you have a slowly shrinking, **melting ice cube in CenturyLink**, jam them together and what could go wrong? Well, a lot can go wrong.

From day one, it was very contentious and its taken Jeff Storey 3 years to **reconfigure** the entity to be **effectively Level 3 again**, from a management perspective, obviously not from a revenue mix perspective, but certainly from people who make decisions on a day-to-day basis. However, it was **prevented by Glen Post, whom stayed on the board**.

# What is LUMN now?

You have Level 3 with a legacy CenturyLink business. CenturyLink is just basically a rural telecom. Think of rural Louisiana, theyre the telecom there. So, if you needed phone service or a really slow internet connection, which is probably DSL, because there is hardly no fiber in these areas and if you need a TV, thats where youre buying it from. And without any question, thats a shrinking business.

Jeff Storey is now the CEO of LUMN, the old **CenturyLink management team unsurprisingly is gone**. Investors love management. Management is always a big part of any investment premise and research. So you now have **management in place that investors love.**

Check out their website does this look like a melting ice cube such as CenturyLink?

In March 2021, Lumen partners with IBM to use their satellites to provide cloud services in any environment.

# What is LUMN now?

Level 3 at its core was IP services. IP services is a fancy way of saying **connectivity**. If you were across the United States, it would go through a fiber line that runs from LA to New York and get into someones building. They own metro loops of fiber within most of the large cities in not only in the United States, but in the world. And they had whats called on net buildings, which is a fancy way of saying their own fiber assets and copper. Sometimes wiring was inside the commercial building that were in. Now LUMN provides Internet Services, but also **owns the underlying fiber across the world**. In fact another part of their business model is to **whole sale their fiber network** to other IP providers. They also provide **content deliver networks**, for our upvotes, streaming videos, etc..

They have a lot of data center assets, three to 400 data centers that they basically run for their customers. They partner with AWS in some cases to offload some forms of traffic and data aggregation. Provide whats called the **edge connectivity solutions to businesses** that dont necessarily want to be a 100% on AWS or 100% on Azure or 100% on their own internal data warehouse has been mainly because of costs. **They compete on a smaller scale for cloud services**, more of an add on service to their core IP connectivity service if you can think of it that way.

They also provide wholesale connectivity to people who use their underlying network as a highway of sorts. And its like a toll road and every single year that the tolls pay to get onto that toll road go down in price while they may not be laying any new transatlantic fibers, whats happened over the course of 20 years is that the actual hardware systems on each side of the fiber line continued to get upgraded every single lets say 12 to 18 months to a new generation. Just think of it as like a string cheese. Like if theyve figured out a way to pull the string cheese ever so more thinly and to create more strands effectively of that string cheese from the same block of cheese they had from the last 10 years.

Top line growth of Lumen is spotty. It has been averaging say 5% over the past five years, top line was down 4.5% in 2019 at the point in time where the economy was still hot and before COVID-19 hit.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe we're exiting the last bear phase and entering into a new bull phase. After the earnings on 11-03-2021 many investors agree.

# Century Link Problems

1.9B Voice business. Effectively zero over time, because many of us dont have home phones anymore. The only reason anyone would get one now a days would be if the cable company bundled it into a package.

The **decline rate** there is pretty intense. Were talking **15 to 20% year over year**. The reason why that matters is you would think that, well, that seems like a silly business to be in, but remember its a 100% profit?

Lines laid over a course of 50 to 80 years, dont have to invest in them as just people pay every single month for this phone service that most people now with cell phones dont really need.

Small and mid-size businesses hard to sustain their top line while every single year they have to bring down prices on connectivity side as well as the Telcos telephone service.

# Who are LUMN's competitors?

In the USA 18T and Verizon, the other legacy Telcos

Outside the US if youre thinking about like who else has the ability to connect people from the US to EU, for example, ORAJ, Eugene and British Telecom.

Theres competition, but there are certain barriers to entry... When youve already laid the fiber, there is a cost base that it makes it very, very difficult for someone to come in and build another whole strand of fiber to compete with you because theyve got to spend the capital and associate the manpower to it, then compete with you on pricing and your assets are already in the ground. So, LUMN can always price lower to knock competitors out of the market.

In fact LUMN surpassed AT&amp;T as a market leader in Ethernet

[https://news.lumen.com/2018-02-22-CenturyLink-Vaults-to-Top-of-U-S-Ethernet-LEADERBOARD](https://news.lumen.com/2018-02-22-CenturyLink-Vaults-to-Top-of-U-S-Ethernet-LEADERBOARD)

# Why Invest in LUMN?

The **connectivity business will continue to grow** as people demand faster speeds, more bandwidth, more capacity, and then more security and other new kind of endpoint and edge services that CenturyLink offers. Level 3 side isnt growing as fast as detecting whatever that trades at 20 times revenue. But there is **core growth at Level 3**, which I think is what the **market doesnt understand and you have shrink to grow at CenturyLink**, which is shrink the parts that are shrinking eventually start to be a smaller part of the total. There are parts within CenturyLink that are growing, which is the broadband side start to grow.

Decline are abating and there are almost no more decline at all. Cost to the degree that their margins are higher and their **cash flows are growing**. Even if their **top line is shrinking the revenue line**, and cash flows are growing. And thats the **inflection point**. The inflection point will be where no growth parts of the company no longer overwhelm the growing parts. Wall Street will then see a growing business that **generates an enormous amount of free cash flow that has a great ability to deliver and trades at a multiple and nothing trades that in terms of how low it is**.

Jeff Storey's performance, his free cash flow number. So the weird thing about this company is that given that Level 3 has publicly traded debt, **Level 3 also still puts out its own independent financials**. So while you can have a consolidated illumine 10K, you could also look at the annual results for the underlying Level 3 business, which allows you to **break apart Level 3 from legacy CenturyLink.**

When Storey came in to be the CEO of the combined entity, the Legacy CenturyLink had a free cash flow number of roughly $1.6b to $7b, that was in 2016. He came in at the end of 17. So well just use 18 as a starting point. From 18 and 19, hes effectively stabilized and slightly even **grown free cash flow while at the very same time CenturyLink has lost call it 10 to 12% of its top line**. Within that melting ice cube, hes managed to **cut enough costs to effectively stabilize free cash flow in the face of a shrinking top-line number**, which is an impressive thing.

Jeff Storeys incentives are three-fold. His comp comes in the form of things tied to EBITDA and free cash flow growth. 90% of a short-term comp is based on that. He also has a **restricted stock issuances** that are also based on the **EBITDA profile of the company**. He currently owns three million shares? So a stock that used to be $25 to him is a whole heck of a lot of money.

The board of $LUMN also added in a **TSR total stock return long-term compensation metric**, which means that while you can argue that hes done a fantastic job on the operating side and hes done all the cost cuts and stabilized cash flows and all these things yet, **if the shareholders arent getting the benefit of all of that, hes not going to get paid at all**.

If the stock does nothing for a year and at least you get a **10.3% dividend (next one on Nov 18th)**, thats a nice thing to have, but as well get into the valuation, the real upside here is based on some of the parts analysis, a discounted cash flow analysis that is **suggestive of much, much higher value**. And the dividend in the meantime is just a nice thing to have assuming its sustainable.

There was an **earnings call on 11/3/2021** and here are the results from it:

**Inv H&amp;S validated with a $28 upside target**. It's obviously clear that the investors **dont' know how to price this company properly**. Hopefully this DD will bring some light into that.

# Why the debt isn't a problem

Usually while looking into debt you focus on the interest coverage ratio. And this is the ratio that determines how easily a company can pay interest expenses on outstanding debt. Its calculated by dividing a companys operating income by its interest expense. $LUMN's interest coverage ratio is at a 2. Obviously the higher the ratio, the better. And we would typically like to see at least five, if not 10. Yes, this looks horrible to investors, but what if you look at debt with a different metric.

EBITDA, which is a kind of a proxy for cash flow minus capital expenditures divided by interest expense. And that number is more like 3.5 and a half, which is Again these numbers, are they stellar? Absolutely not. Is that certainly a concern of the market? 100%. $LUMN's perception is that theres an inflection point in terms of growth that is upcoming. The capital that they are spending now will continue to generate even better returns because theyre much more targeting their capital expenditures and the cash flows they generate can more than offset. Well, they **can pay down debt**, they can **pay a dividend**, they can **pay their interest**, and they just **annouced a 1B $ buy back** on shares.

Theres a virtuous cycle of **debt paid down** and **lower debt costs**. The **EBDITA has been growing year over year** and the new management is focused on **paying down debt**. Right now on a net debt EBITDA basis, EBITDA being their proxy for cash flow, **theyre at 3.7 times**, which is certainly not that high.

When CenturyLink bought Level 3 it was almost 4 years ago? They **paid $34B for the acquisition**. Lets just assume that no value was added for three years, which I would disagree with, because I think this is one of those companies that gets more valuable over time. Going back to Warren Buffet, he believes in **no compounds right value every single year**. They have about 30 billion in debt. So that takes out the entire debt stack just from the Level 3 assets. Meaning that if you subtract out that EBITDA number 2.8 billion, which comes directly from public filings not adjusted and no magic nonsense of core whatever billion different adjustments that people make, you get at the legacy CenturyLink of 5.8 billion **EBITDA almost for free**.

My premise is that as long as people wake up to the fact that the c**ore assets of Level 3 are worth** what they are worth in the private market for, lets say, **around $30 billion**. Let's apply even some modicum of multiple to the remaining CenturyLink assets, you have a **completely insane risk reward from 950 or whatever its trading at today**. For margin of safety is that if someone offered me $1.7 billion in cash flow today, and I only have to pay 10 billion to get it, I would take that bet. Thats it in a nutshell.

# The Catalyst!

Ill point out that Jeff Storey was going to **retire**, he was basically **forced** to come back into this role. Hes 59 years old. He doesn't want to do this forever. Although, it's not public information they havent said it, but supposition based on the **name change, the branding change** is that the company is in the middle of a long process of actually **undoing this merger**.

CenturyLink should trade at a lower EBDITA multiple, a business like Level 3 should **trade at a higher EBDITA multiple** and to adjust some comparable transactions a much higher multiple. These two businesses dont work together in Wall Streets mind. But if you **separate them**, basically undoing what was an ill-fated marriage from the very beginning, thats how you create a lot of **value for shareholders**.

In fact since Lumen is such an **asset heavy company** they're looking at how they should split the assets. There are a number of different ways that they could do this. The question is, are they going to do it? And whats holding them back? In the middle of COVID, youre not going to sell physical assets. People couldnt even visit the assets until very recently. This also includes the naming rights to the Seattle Seahawks stadium.

**The rebranding is just the first sign**, getting rid of the CenturyLink name, calling this company Lumen, saying that youre more of a **tech company, the writings on the wall**, this is going to happen. And then the question is, **what is it worth**? What is someone willing to pay for it? And thats kind of as were sitting here **clipping a 10.3% coupon**, it's obvious the numbers are a lot higher than has been anticipated.

Although it's not public knowledge yet, but I do you think that youve seen signs that theyve been very thoughtful about that. $LUMN has expressed an openness to do anything that **adds value for shareholders**, including **transactions, spinoffs**, things that would be more of a **catalyst for value creation.**

I was just looking at their proxy statement, which by the way is just the annual data sent to shareholders about whos on the board, whos up for reelection on the board, corporate governance and then compensation, but also in the proxy statement, there is a change in control clause, which is like, if this company gets sold, how much does the CEO make? Well, theres $16 million in severance for Jeff Storey if the company gets sold and based on the stock price, I think at probably December 31st, he was $44 million if the company was sold. So getting back to incentives, does he have an incentive to maybe **transact this company**? I think the **44 million reasons** why there could be a value creating transaction of some kind in our near future.

**TLDR;**

Lumen Technologies is two businesses combined CenturyLink and Level3. CenturyLink is a dying telecom business and the melting icecube of the two businesses. Level 3 is a connectivity business, which also compete with smaller cloud services. The merger occured and the investors didn't like Glen Post the CEO of CenturyLink who sat on the board of Lumen, he's gone as of Jan 2020 and Jeff Storey is now the CEO of Lumen and driving the business in the right direction, the financials show it. Lumen owns the majority of the fiber network that connects the united states and transalantic, when acquisition occured it was valued at 34b. A lot has been done since the acquisition, so I believe it is valued a lot higher than 34b. Lumen currently is 30b in debt (which is equal to their assets), but the debt is being paid down, they do a share repurchase program (recently filed a 13D/A on Nov 1st for it for 1B)and a 10.3% dividend (coming up on Nov 18th). The catalyst is in the proxy statement where the current CEO would get a 44 million payout if the company is sold and split. CenturyLink &amp; Level 3 were and illfated marriage from the beginning which is why the investors in the spac sold out to burn CenturyLink in the beginning. The new CEO has been paying down debt increasing the free cashflow &amp; ebdita quarter after quarter. There was an earnings call 11-03-2021 and quarter after quarter the company continues to improve. There is nothing but greatness in the future for Lumen. Level 3 will be valued a lot more without CenturyLink as burden and it's starting to become more obvious to investors. It's also very obvious that investors are confused on how to price this asset heavy company properly with CenturyLink dragging down $LUMN. I truely believe this is a hidden gem to hold for the long term, you're starting to see analysts price their targets from $13, $25, $28, the buy back program also shows how they believe how undervalued the shares are. It's only going to get better for Lumen once they get rid of the melting ice cube known as CenturyLink.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo2p1g/lumen_technologies_hidden_value_lumn/

**Why this is worth the read:**

I have been in this play for the past 3 weeks, not because of the ""November 1st"" merger announcement, but because I believe that this is a fantastic opportunity for a short and long term investment.

The November 1st rumor had made that day so hyped that it was practically an international holiday... but let's break down the AGC/Grab SEC filings.

**What we know:**

https://preview.redd.it/0gy06xb7tzx71.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc3f7109bc37b7c2d7e64db13699762dbf251a7

 Per the charter, they establish a timeline of 24 months from completion of the IPO to execute a merger. However, if theyve selected a target and filed a merger prospectus, they get *27 months* which has happened. 

https://preview.redd.it/t3b8wzk9tzx71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cec4b3a18a46622e6f9894c87f112a099302116

The IPO was completed on October 5th, 2020. As we learned, they likely have 27 months, so they have to complete the merger by January 5th, 2023.

So unfortunately, it would seem that AGC actually isnt under any immediate deadline as far as the merger is concerned in regards to their charter. The only thing to consider is that should the GRAB merger fall through, theyd have a much more limited timeframe to secure a replacement (if that is even of interest to them). So moving on, we need to look at any termination clauses in their merger prospectus with GRAB:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r15b2zybtzx71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a71e8ada03f9a6262600e40867ceba673de7383

 Ok, so this was entered into on April 12th, 2021 and it states that the agreement can be freely canceled by either party after 270 days have elapsed and the merger hasnt still be completed. 270 days from then is January 7th, 2022. Now, were getting closer as this deadline is much closer. For the last piece, we need to check one more thing; that being the stipulations for the vote: 

https://preview.redd.it/lzg9r1mdtzx71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c664480dc38e15fb84bcd510c2ea826c21514c07

So, should a vote be needed (most likely scenario), they have to give no less than 10 days and no more than 60 days notice of it. This means that if the companies are wanting to avoid running past the 270 day deadline, shareholders would have to be notified before mid December at the latest to provide enough time for everything to go through. However, if theyre going to provide 30 days notice, similar to other plays we've seen, theyll likely need to do it in early to mid November.

I would imagine, as Id predicted earlier, the November 1st rumor probably emerged from a reading of these documents. There is a caveat to this theory though, which is that either company could choose not to terminate the merger agreement after 270 and proceed unimpeded. However, there is one last piece, the PIPE subscription agreements have a different termination clause which is automatic:

**Thoughts/Conclusion:**

This gives a little more weight to the January 7th deadline and to the theory that they may need to get the ball rolling sooner rather than later which is likely what produced the estimate of November 1st. We shall see.

strong close on Friday. I am still holding 75% of the position. I am looking for a very strong open to adjust my stop and scale out further

now that that the Nov %th calls expired market makers may no longer be motivated to keep this below $40. it might be able to stretch its legs. The strong action on Friday may inspire new longs and continue to pressure shorts for a few more sessions, but as always we hit and try not to get hit

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks rose on the back of a rally in companies that stand to benefit the most from an economic recovery, as well as positive results from Pfizer's COVID-19 pill study. Treasury 10-year yields have fallen below 1.5%.
* ll major equity benchmarks set new highs, with the S&amp;P 500 posting its fifth consecutive weekly gain, the longest streak since August 2020. Despite the fact that industrial and commodity stocks outpaced technology firms, the Nasdaq 100 rose for the tenth day in a row. Airlines, cruise lines, hotels, and small-cap stocks all increased their stock prices.
* The labour market in the United States returned to normalcy in October, with a larger-than-expected and broad-based payroll increase, indicating greater progress in filling millions of vacancies as the effects of the delta variant faded.
* After large upward revisions to the previous two months, nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6%, while labor-force participation remained stable. Earnings per hour rose in line with expectations, rising the most since February.

FORDS GROWTH to the #1 US AUTOMAKER by sales volume:
UNIT SALES in the past 3 Months. 

August 21 - 124,176
September 21 - 157,000 (+26%  +32,824 )
October 21 - 175,918 (+12.1%. +18,918 )

May 22- 301,493
June 22 - 325,612
July 22 - 351,661
August 22 - 379,794

Analysis &amp; Conclusion: 
Ford grew sales at 26% in September and 12.1 % in October. With a projected 8% growth rate month to month for 10 months Ford will have tripled sales and revenue by August 2022 from August 2021. If this were to take place Ford stock would be worth well over $100.00 a share. Keep in mind the 26% growth in September and the 12.1 % in October is constrained by supply shortages. I used a conservative 8% projection to account for future potential supply constraints so I believe numbers are in the ballpark. 

Ford is clearly a Growth stock at this point and WallStreet will reevaluate and adjust its value to match its trajectory. 

If you have any doubts about how extraordinary Fords performance is look at Toyota the old leader that Ford dethroned in 3 months in the US market. Compare the below numbers to Fords numbers.

1,"11/06/2021, 20:39:39",DNUT ~ The fated trade; an insider train to tendie town,ErectoPeentrounus,"***Introduction***

As far as my research shows Krispy Kreme was once a public company that was taken private and now is public again. The company that owned them was JAB holdings which is now a beneficial owner (10%, which has been long bumped up to 15%). They went from around 6million shares to 9million shares.

This is ABNORMAL, after a company IPO, the holders/owners Pre public release would want to sell and collect profits or just free up cash but these dudes go in and buy shares like theres no tomorrow. They bought all across the board and on various prices. The quantities they are buying in is abnormal and the time at which they are buying is also abnormal. Both are very bullish in my opinion. Unless they plan on going underwater then the stock price better go above $17 which brings us to my positions. They literally bought 123mil worth of shares in about a months time... its almost like an unannounced share buyback system.

&amp;#x200B;

***Historical data cross analysis that cant go tits up***

This is me betting on the ER. I noticed they lowered their EPS expectations  which makes no sense since both time frames covered by the earning reports are peak restaurant months which are April through August. These dudes are playing the classical, lower guidance so much that you easily beat causing a price pump.The  Q2 report was 349M in revenue and 0.08 EPS according to nasdaq (some sites were different at 0.13 like RH but most seem to agree/show that the forecasted EPS is 0.06 EPS and a revenue of 337.7M (all sites agree on revenue numbers). But we can see that they lowered guidance for a term thats usually the years best term for their industry and we KNOW it is the best term by comparing other chains earnings reports that just came out.

For reference McDonalds Q2 and Q3 are always similar but Q3 has been often higher. Q3 is the one reported in September 

[A chart for the lazy autists who dont wanna see the numbers, but link below is about 16 years worth of data supporting my claims](https://preview.redd.it/zqst3y95tux71.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b3928a0d5a0e18b01a46284b73dea68888cf3bd)

Starbucks and other companies also follow a similar trend. Them lowering EPS to nearly half when it is often larger and will most likely be larger if it follows MCD and SBUX reports and trends  which it will as they seem to go hand in hand as an industry. They are GUARANTEED to beat the earnings and they know it which is why they are buy-in such large quantities of shares in an abnormal and non traditional post IPO fashion. 

***The chart \~ for my astrology loving autists*** 

I will go from large time frames to smaller time frames, this is a very solid trade short and longterm trade hence I got short and long term contracts because I simply just love money!!

[Candle sticks, confirmed morning star which is bullish](https://preview.redd.it/3ovzgl6hwyx71.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=562abcde4b07a7f8cc12693a9c6a5c88f9b9f155)

[Daily, we in a descending channel which usually breaks up, we can see a mini trojan horse bull flag inside of it thats starting to break upwards with confirmation closing above R1 = bullish as fuck](https://preview.redd.it/tm48nzzexyx71.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e9a87eff9660517911cdccaa17208ebca0d2715)

[On the 1hour frame we can see that we formed a bull flag whose price target is $15, this flag broke out and is working its way up. This is what I call a trojan horse flag since its breakout will trigger the breakout of the descending channel. Which will trigger more bullish moves on the larger frames](https://preview.redd.it/q0nj89m2yyx71.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdc39a4d615e66ed436802184028a02ae22fde20)

The technical analysis here should work like a domino effect and get us up to at least $16 in the short frame but the long frame is welp the sky, idk lol but anything under $16 will have insiders under water and I doubt they plan on losing money even if they have to fake deals and hype.

***Position and the story of an autist***

Currently I am all in (about 1k) in calls, 11 $17.5 contracts expiring on 19th and 30 17.5 contracts expiring in December.(might offload some December in favor of the 19th since that fits my leverage tolerance a little more). I cant afford to lose this money as it is the last of my savings and ive lost everything else but I truly believe in this trade. I actually stumbled upon this trade after just crashing my last balance to $5 while searching Krispy Kreme donut prices and the ticker popped up so it has to be fate. I instantly did what any intelligent human being would do and deposited the last 1k of my savings and bought. Its also No Nut November and the ticker is literally DNUT aka da Nut, its literally the one NUT u bust after holding in for a few days and building up the horny energy, this nut is usually explosive with lots of fire power so my price target for this will be $20 post ER, in the short term then $30 by the end of November. Buying shares here is useless in my opinion, just trust the insiders, the cross analysis, and TA if the NUT thesis with all its might wasn't enough to convince you. This trade cant go tits up because it will go NUT up.

***Conclusion***

Thanks for attending my ted talk, this isnt financial advice, just my attempt to document one of the most brilliant trade ideas I have come up with and eternalize it on this subreddit. Any gains to be made off of here are going to be 1 week for small and short term gains to genuine investing and holding as you'll be buying here at a premium cheaper than the insiders themselves. Im in options since I believe they won't flop the ER and will actually beat with positive guidance but insiders often buy and can hold for a year or two before announcing the actual news so that would be a safer bet but $14 to $20 or even $30 isnt enough for me of a return even if it was guaranteed. I want 1000% returns only at bare minimum and I want them now.If ER is positive which it should be then I think it'll run at least 30% in one week and be bullish going forward running up but perhaps at a slower pace and occasionally retracing back a lil kinda like SPY or any respectable companies bull trend.

1,"11/06/2021, 19:35:54",WHY I THROW MY MONEY AT TRICIDA (TCDA),Professional-Donut84,"**TLDR;**

**Insiders and hedgefunds are buying TCDA stock in preparation for the FDA approval of their drug, veverimer. We bottomed out and are awaiting FDA approval to get a potential 10-20 bagger. Float is tiny (25.28M), short interest 6.21%.**

&amp;#x200B;

Ok fellow autists, i never wrote a DD before, but i felt like i have to ~~try~~  this time.

I was told by an insider that TCDA is a hot topic in the pharmaceutical community right now. Every high ranked person in the pharma sector is buying TCDA like *crazy* right now. And also many hedgefunds are interested in this particular stock.

**Why?**

The reason for that is, that they are developing a non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer for the  treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which they call veverimer.

You can read more about the drug [here](https://www.tricida.com/veverimer/).

The treatment is not *yet* FDA approved, but guess what. The CEOs of big pharma and hedgefunds are buying at the 4-5$ support right now, because they know something the public doesnt. Which most likely is, that at the next trial the FDA will approve the treatment because of the results they will deliver.

[Hedgies buying.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-crazy-tricida-inc-160547124.html)

I know, i know.. most of you are not very good at reading so i will add a few pictures so your monkey brains can comprehend whats most like gonna happen.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cerpf47nfyx71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a4ec8b5b6a9a848b6f8b6bb885b80b2daf0afa6

Measuring the FIB-levels, you can clearly see that there is gigantic upside potential. I am talking about a 3 bagger at the absolute **MINIMUM** (even without approval, just straight buying pressure because of that info (TINY FLOAT)). 

When the drug gets approved, we are talking about 10-20 baggers dear sirs and ladies, if not more.

Expectations were high at the end of 2019 but the FDA didnt approve the drug at the first trial, so the price kept plummeting. Now tho, the information is slowly seeping through, that the drug WILL most likely get approval within the next months.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w8y6c1h9hyx71.png?width=432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a6e7a6e6bd459ae2be461a7e467b6842decb84

As you can see, institutions are holding 85,7% of the float.

The float is tiny with 25.28 million shares in existence and it is shorted 6.21%.

You can bet your sweet ass that the covering begins if the price breaches the 8$ area.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q50yggifjyx71.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=472086da45ad9c8faec70b2ef1e6380b046c0044

TCDA will report their earnings on monday, november 8th after market close.

This could go either way, but i think the fact that they will most likely get approval soon is the main driving factor of this stock price. 

If they miss earnings you could get a better entry. But i strongly belive the support @ 4$ will hold.

If they beat earnings you *may* miss the better entry but still have the approval to look forward to.

&amp;#x200B;

I have strong reasons to belive that the stock bottomed out and we are currently in a phase where insiders are buying based on what they know.

My personal position at the moment are 50 shares @ 5,36 and I will continue to buy more every day/week until we reach approval. Options are not my kind of thing, but you do you.

&amp;#x200B;

*Finally, I have to say that I am in no way a financial advisor. I buy this stock because i am an autistic retard who has money to lose and based on information i got from someone who works in the pharma sector who got the word from their bosses. I share this information only, so i could get my fat ass to work and analyze the company while writing this post.*

Okay So any apes that hold $GME already know that their lives r going to change forever after the MOASS, and Ive been thinking about what the aftermath might be like, and where apes can potentially go from there.

I havent really seen any big ideas or proposals that are retarded enough for this community to pursue after the MOASS; But that changes today, Because I (along with another retarded retard) have come up with a rough outline of GameStop The Nation-State

We know the price is wrong, we know that GameStop is a multi-trillion dollar company, and we know that theres close to a million heavily invested apes that may or may not be interested in developing a nation powered by GameStop.

This may sound ridiculous, and it absolutely is, but i have faith in our cognitively limited smoothbrains, and believe we can find a plausible route to becoming an internationally recognized government led by Emperor Ryan Cohen.

Now building a new country from scratch may pose some logistical problems, but I believe we can figure this shit out. After the MOASS well easily have enough bananas to afford an island/large area of open land to develop on. 

Our national currency will of course be $GME token, and by the time we finish constructing our banana utopia, GameStop will most likely be selling groceries, power tools, jetskis etc. So the only commercial store well ever need is GameStop. 

I could go into more detail about my outlines and projections if anyone is interested in this concept. I truly believe theres enough apes and enough resources to pull this off. 

If youre having trouble wrapping ur head around this idea, I recommend utilizing $THC as an aphrodisiac to open ur mind to the possibility of GameStop The Nation-State.

1,"11/06/2021, 17:10:16",INTC the sleeping giant,TachyonArray,"Hi fellow retards, been a fellow lurker for a few years now but decided to post because I recently shifted my stance on $INTC and figured I should get the full smooth-brain experience by getting roasted by my fellow apes.  

I figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intels strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. 

First of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&amp;D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how theyve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). 

On the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is a threat to our economic securityand by extension, to our national security](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. 

There is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if youre also smooth brained, you likely know its INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china wants to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). 

You know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and theyve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).

Intel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnwkfx/intc_the_sleeping_giant/

Comments and answers to questions I anticipate from prior posts about my savings:

1)  This was invested almost entirely in domestic US index funds:  Large-Cap, Mid-Cap, and Small-Cap.  Evenly split between the three for like the first 25 years.  I am now almost entirely in Large-Cap funds because it is less volatile than Small-Cap.  I did experiment with bonds a little bit,  which actually cost me money.  And I made one stock gamble in 2008 that got a gain which I estimate has grown to $55k today.

2)  The source of my money was almost entirely salary contributions and matching (ranging from 16% when I was younger to 10% today). The only exception is that circa 2000 I got a pension payout which I stuck in an IRA in index funds.  I estimate it has grown to ~$75k today.

3)  My salary is OK but not spectacular:  I made $33k in 1995;  I made $93k last year.  

4)  I never panicked and moved my money into something safer when the market was down.  The couple of times I experimented with bonds,  it was a small percentage of my portfolio and I did it when the market was way up.  I did buy my stock when the market was waaaay down,  but I YOLO-ed it on Ford stock one month before GM announced it was going to run out of money;  pretty much the opposite of ""safe"".  

5)  It took me  f o r e v e r   to get my first $100k.  It happened in late 2004,  almost 11 years after I started saving.  But I estimate that my 2004 year-end balance of $114k has grown to about $600k today.  So a little more than half of my current balance is growth of that first $100k.

6)  I had been working for 6 years before I started contributing to my 401k.  Back then, only about half of companies even offered 401ks,  and only about half of people who had one available contributed to them.  Had I started 6 years prior,  even though my salary was low (ranged from $18k to $30k),  had I contributed 10% ($13.9k in total contributions) and gotten a 5% match,  I estimate that money would be worth another $445k today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnszrg/how_i_made_1_million_index_funds_time/

Aligners itself is approved in many European countries and are successfully sold. But we still have fake dentists fear mongering. Operates in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Hong Kong, Singapore, Spain and Mexico.

It's important to note that the long-term story for SDC is intact and looks very promising, as they turn their business around to avoid these short-term one-off issues. SDC has a vertically-integrated platform and a very unique way of operating that prevents any other competitors from stealing their business. This is crucial to their business and is what will eventually allow them to grow profitably. Also keep in mind the extras they are selling including various dental products.

3) Recent byte acquisition for 1b gives cue:

They could clearly receive a buy-out from Any healthcare company. At this valuation, I think major health care companies, manufacturing companies are seriously doing due diligence on SDC. I would clearly see P&amp;G or another conglomerate getting interested in SDC at these prices.

BayMedica owns the propriety process they use to extract more than just Cannabinoids...if anyone has ever worked or has knowledge of labs will know that is extremely important/kinda groundbreaking.

I think this is a good time to get in due to the positive news and low hype. I think earnings will be slightly above Expected but not much, but stock will probably average up to $2 after. Then Q1 2022 financials will probably see much larger growth.

To start, CHEGG (CHGG) is currently trading at $30.68. Why is this extremely insane to me? Because at a price of $30 this means CHGG is currently trading lower than its all time high for the year 2018 and pre-pandemic 2019. Why is that important? Because that means in a market of inflated and overvalued stocks, CHGG is one of the few gems that not only had a massive run up with the rest of the market, but is now officially deflated to pre-pandemic levels. Thats right, CHGG is one of the few stocks that had a massive run up this year, yet is no longer overvalued but in fact highly undervalued.

-

**Why is it undervalued?** 


Well for starters, ask yourself why 2021 CHGG should logically be trading lower than it did when the company was in 2018 let alone 2019 pre-pandemic. Is the company a worse company? Has it been performing worse than it did in 2018 through 2019 pre-pandemic? The answer is a resounding no. 


Not only has the company gained a vast amount of notoriety/attention from students and teachers alike (meaning its more likely to retain old students as well as attract new students, than it was in 2018-pp2019) but it ended the quarter with better numbers all across the board when compared to 2018-pp2019. 

-

**So whats the catch, why is the price low?**


Lets start with the ugly. The price of CHGG tanked because Chegg is projected to have fewer subscribers than they did at the height of the lockdowns (something I figured was a common sense conclusion for most lockdown-benefitting companies). 


Now Sure, they may not do as good at they did in lockdown, however that in no way means they will or should do **the same** as, or are the same company as before the lockdowns. To think such is imo absolutely crazy.

-

**So why the overreaction?** 


Many of the big boys know that CHGG was primarily used to cheat on tests during lockdown, and therefore the lockdowns are undeniably linked to their huge growth. However, in their head, its stretched to the extreme. Instead of trading it under the assumption that **this company may not immediately do as good as it during the height of the lockdowns, but its had a lot of growth and will still be better off than before them ** theyre operating under the mindset of **no lockdown = no company** Thats it. Thats their entire fear/thought process and the entire reason CHGG is trading at its current price.


Now let me tell you why I think thats stupid. For CHGG to be trading at its pre-pandemic prices, this would logically mean that CHGG is or **is going to be** relatively the same company it was pre-pandemic. The big boys are expecting all the numbers to go back to where they were before the pandemic maybe even lower. However i dont think they will. Why? For many reasons.


Such as the fact that not only has covid not resolved itself, but many students are still abstaining from taking in-person classes due to vaccine mandates. Furthermore, the rate of students taking online classes has steadily increased every single year for the past 10 years straight and is projected to continue to rise for the foreseeable future. 


Further yet again, what have we all been hearing for over a year now? That a record number of people **want to stay home**, that **people do not want to go back to the office**. More companies and people, every year are finding ways to get work done from home, and we can see this same trend in regard to the classroom, further helping CHGGs future bull case. 


Apart from this aspect, as I said before; to believe CHGG is worth pp2019 prices, one would have to disregard all the notoriety, investors, new-subscribers, cash and everything else its gained over the last year as having no effect on the company. **This.** **Is.** **Stupid.** I subscribed to CHGG this year and am still subbed. Its undeniable that CHGG has been introduced to a **plethora of new investors and students** alike, meaning theres **no reason it should return to pp2019 subscriber level**, in fact it should and is still projected to be well above 2018-pp2019 levels**.

Further yet again, CHGGs CEO is so baffled by this reaction even hes buying the f***ing dip!! Lmfao. Thats right, Chegg has just announced its doing a total buyback for One BILLION dollars. This means not only will the share price increase, but that the company 


1.**believes in the itself** and knows its worth more


and


2. **has MONEY**. 

-

**BUT WAIT THERES MORE**

Now that ive explained all of this to you degenerate gamblers. Think of it this way. If the stock is already trading at lower than pre-pandemic all time highs, you are not only buying low (**buy low sell high retards**) but you are putting your money in what can in my opinion be considered a safer investment than the majority of the current market because its one of the few stocks that is no longer overvalued, in fact its undervalued **in even non-pandemic times.**

Now let me summarize this all for you because ive ranted enough. 

-

**Summary: Why YOU should buy CHGG right now!**

&gt;**Hedgies even value it at ~$50 yet it is currently at $30 (potential 60-70% gain)**

&gt;**Its at pre-pandemic prices despite being a more valuable company than it was pre-pandemic (therefore no reason it should be valued the same)**

&gt;**Probably wont crash further because its already at its already around its average lows for the past 4 years (not a part of the bubble anymore)**

&gt;**Online classes continue to increase every year (meaning increasing Chegg use every year)**

I havent really seen any big ideas or proposals that are retarded enough for this community to pursue after the MOASS; But that changes today, Because I (along with another retarded retard) have come up with a rough outline of GameStop The Nation-State

We know the price is wrong, we know that GameStop is a multi-trillion dollar company, and we know that theres close to a million heavily invested apes that may or may not be interested in developing a nation powered by GameStop.

This may sound ridiculous, and it absolutely is, but i have faith in our cognitively limited smoothbrains, and believe we can find a plausible route to becoming an internationally recognized government led by Emperor Ryan Cohen.

Now building a new country from scratch may pose some logistical problems, but I believe we can figure this shit out. After the MOASS well easily have enough bananas to afford an island/large area of open land to develop on. 

Our national currency will of course be $GME token, and by the time we finish constructing our banana utopia, GameStop will most likely be selling groceries, power tools, jetskis etc. So the only commercial store well ever need is GameStop. 

I could go into more detail about my outlines and projections if anyone is interested in this concept. I truly believe theres enough apes and enough resources to pull this off. 

If youre having trouble wrapping ur head around this idea, I recommend utilizing $THC as an aphrodisiac to open ur mind to the possibility of GameStop The Nation-State.

For example, if I were to buy a $AAPL $120 Call, expiring 11/12 (+.10% B/E) Could I realistically expect a 10% return or no?

Hey everyone. Just barely poking my toes in options. Figured this group would be perfect to ask since its filled with seasoned common folk. 

I blew up my first account back in 2018 lol told myself I wouldnt trade again until I read some books and look at charts with some sort of understanding. Since then Ive had more green than red days. However, I still have red days with Big Percentage losses. Trying to work on that and looking for advice.

Currently, I kinda do a little bit of everything. I scalp, day, swing, and hold stocks long. Heavy emphasis on the swing trading, you know, less than 25k account. 

I tried following ticker suggestions from different subreddits and I take an L most of the time lol stopped following blindly..

Now I just see what tickers have momentum/Positive sentiment. I look at the chart using different time frames. If the technical analysis looks bullish. I set up support resistance lines. Then look for trend reversals and entry/sell points. I then pick 1 stock looking at catalysts. Once my pre-reqs are met I buy into the stock. You know: trend reversal, low rsi, MACD green, and MA/EMA lines in okay position. I use stop losses. But have been successful without riding the waves. 

I lost the Diamond Hand Ape mentality and learned there is nothing wrong talking profits. Green is Green and 100% gains are actually satisfying. I also only married One stock that I will hold forever. Everything else doesnt have emotion. 

BUT. I am very aggressive. I have a max of 2 stocks and 1 (decentralized currency) at a time. Roughly all 33% of my portfolio. I tell myself I wont be so risky when I have unlimited day trades. 

To cover my ass. Do I buy puts for whatever my stock entry price was? And if as planned, the stock goes up I just let the put expire worthless? Or how do options act as insurance? I dont want to get too crazy in options- I have an addictive personality with high risk/loss tolerance and a functioning retard. Too risky for me lol but how can I use them as a safety net? 

Also, how is this stuff taxed? In Seattle.. 

And what do you call my trading strategy? Maybe theres a subreddit

Thank you for reading. Please tear me apart and tell me what you learned? Im on year 3.

1,"11/06/2021, 10:31:37",What happened to BNTX and MRNA? (Quite long),tyrsdisciple,"This type of thing is generally something I won't do because I have never studied the markets until very recently. I studied medicine and chemistry.  Advice is often worth what you paid for it.

Getting to the point:  MRNA got dumped on an earnings miss, which is never good to blow your guidance by over 10%, but such as life.  But what does this have to do with BNTX?

Nothing.  BNTX displays no evidence that they have had the same difficulties MRNA had this quarter.  

Their earnings are next week.  PFE and BNTX got approval for vaccination of the 5-11 age range with studies looking to bring that age down to 6 months old are in progress. 

What about the PFE (and MRK) surprise? The oral medication reportedly drops the risk of severe disease and death by 90% if given within the first 5 days.  There are a few issues with the assumption that this will kill vaccine demand and I'll list them as briefly as one can.

1)  Still have to get FDA approval and make more of it  
2)  Only studied in adults so far  
3)  Side effects found in post-marketing with drugs of this nature are almost always found  
4)  Not everyone will be a candidate for the pill  
5)  Vaccination will still be the primary mode of reducing risk because with very few doubts in my mind this will be an expensive drug

The life and death of newer pharma companies is their pipeline because it takes many years to develop a candidate and put it into clinical trials (very roughly 2 years per step on traditional drugs).  Historically only about 30% of drug candidates made it past phase 3.  This is where things change in the mRNA world.  

One of the most difficult issues with drugs is getting them to the target.  In the case of mRNA therapies, COVID-19 put that research on a rocket sled and *it worked.*  The manufacturing, storage, and biochemical delivery mechanisms are functional and will get better with time.  

What remains is finding new targets that the body can use to kill infections (viral, bacterial, parasites) and cancer (quite similar infectious disease in many ways).  **ALL** companies working in mRNA therapies are in a foot race to find targets the immune system can use to treat these issues.  What makes this therapy different is that you can literally ""print"" different candidates.  This is not the case with organic compounds that have way more bench time to perfect the process and then tweak the manufacturing process.  You can literally crank out mRNA therapy candidates in days to weeks, which should reduce the time to get into Phase 1.

Wall St **MAY** like the results of the Phase 2 trial for advanced melanoma that BNTX is presenting Nov 10-14, but unless it is a real barn burner, it shouldn't affect the stock but it might make people sleep better at night knowing the mRNA therapy works on more than just COVID-19 (which we already know it should).

The crash of these stocks is rather short-sighted even by Wall St standards.  I would be much more worried if I started to see significant numbers (more than 70%) of Phase 2 and Phase 3 candidates failing.  I would not be surprised if there is a bounce-back on Monday after people catch a breath.

What they should be liking more is the fact that BTNX is making money, they will continue to make money from multiple sources including being hired to do investigations, and long term they will be way more profitable unless there is some sort of surprise that science is unable to foresee today. MRNA is going through some growing pains, but they'll get it together if they haven't already.  Either is a buy and diamond hands.

Sure TLRY is trading over book value, and HEXO is trading 60% under book value. TLRY has also multinational conglomerates forming, but HEXO also has a higher percentage of the Canadian market than TLRY. I personally have positions in both, but 90% in TLRY.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 8th, 2021.

# **Stocks could soar to new heights in week ahead  even though inflation data may come in hot - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/stocks-could-soar-to-new-heights-in-week-ahead-even-though-inflation-data-may-come-in-hot.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could take aim at new highs in the week ahead, even as investors face fresh data that could show the highest year-over-year jump in consumer inflation in more than 30 years.
*****
&gt; Stocks touched record levels Friday, after a monumental week that included the Federal Reserves announcement that it will wind down its bond buying, the first big step away from the easing measures it put in place to fight the pandemic.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 2% for the week, endig at a record 4,697. The Dow, also at a new high, rose 1.4% to 36,327, and the Nasdaq jumped 3% to a record 15,971.
*****
&gt; The important drivers of the market, I think, remain intact  earnings and interest rates, said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. I think the Fed gave the equity market what it was looking for... which was an awareness of inflation without an overreaction to inflation. Meanwhile were still digesting whats been a really strong earnings season.
*****
&gt; The Fed expects to fully wind down its $120 billion-per-month bond purchases by the middle of next year. At that point some economists expect the central bank to start raising interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell assured markets the central bank still sees inflation as temporary, but that if it proves to be hotter, the Fed would act.
*****
&gt; I think investors are sounding the all-clear for the equities market here, at least in the short-term, and its hard to argue with. We have more concerns when you take a six-month view, said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; The biggest concern is inflation which we dont think is transitory, he added. I would look for a rate hike almost immediately after the tapering process is done which is mid-2022.
*****
&gt; # The stickiness of higher prices
&gt; Donabedian said the concern is that sticky inflation could force the Fed to move sooner to raise interest rates to battle rising prices.
*****
&gt; The producer price index and consumer price index are reported Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Economists expect both reports to remain elevated for October. Headline PPI is expected to rise 0.6%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; CPI is expected to be the hottest post-pandemic print yet. Headline CPI inflation is expected to rise by 0.6% or 5.9% year-over-year, the fastest pace since December 1990. Core inflation, excluding energy and food, is expected to rise 4.3% year-over-year.
*****
&gt; The acceleration in shelter costs is stunning so if you get that, along with energy price increases, we could see a 5.7% [headline gain], said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
&gt; Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said markets are already expecting the elevated inflation prints.
*****
&gt; Markets right now have a certain amount of tunnel vision. Easy money will continue for awhile and even though the Fed has told us theyre not refilling the punch bowl, the party is going to go on for quite some time, he said. Right now the path of least resistance is higher.
*****
&gt; # Fed officials not on same page
&gt; Central bank speakers will also be a highlight in the week ahead, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appearing at two events. On Monday, he is at a Fed conference on gender and the economy. He speaks Tuesday at a virtual conference on diversity and inclusion in economics, finance and central banking, co-hosted by the Federal Reserve Board, Bank of Canada, Bank of England and European Central Bank.
*****
&gt; There are plenty of other Fed officials speaking as well, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, New York Fed President John Williams and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly.
*****
&gt; CIBCs Donabedian said the group of speakers could be important, and it will be key to listen for nuances to their views on rising prices. You do get some different twists on inflation. While its not going to look like an FOMC feud at all, it will look like members are not on the same page on inflation, he said.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching Congress for any progress on the Biden spending plan, which is meeting opposition in the Senate.
*****
&gt; It looks like were going to get some sort of vote in the House on the two big fiscal packages, said Donabedian. He said he expects the House to pass both, and the infrastructure bill should be signed into law.
*****
&gt; It does leave open whether the Senate is going to want to make major change to the social spending bill, and theres a chance that that flops, he said, noting it has less than a 50% chance of failing.
*****
&gt; The earnings season is winding down but there are still a number of reports in the coming week, including The Walt Disney Company on Wednesday.

&gt; # Best and Worst Performers Since the COVID Crash Low

&gt; The major indices have consistently been hitting new record highs over the past few days with the S&amp;P 500 having now more than doubled off the COVID Crash low on March 23, 2020. As for individual stocks, there are currently only nine S&amp;P 500 stocks that are below their levels from March 23, 2020, and expanding the universe to the S&amp;P 1500 which includes small and mid-caps, there are currently 41 stocks that are below their levels from that date. Obviously, March 23, 2020 may not coincide with a particular high or low point on these individual stocks' charts, but declines since then would be quite painful to handle given that the broad market has more than doubled over the same time frame.

&gt; As shown below, eHealth (EHTH) currently is the biggest decliner versus March 23, 2020 levels having fallen over 60% with a large share of that decline occurring this year. The only other stock that has been more than cut in half since the bear market low is Tabula Rasa HealthCare (STRA). TRHC has been declining since the spring, but a large share of that decline is actually occurring today after it reported an EPS and sales miss in addition to lowered guidance on earnings last night. Today, the stock has fallen nearly 50% in reaction to those weak earnings. There are a handful of stocks on this list that are up on a year-to-date basis with Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) the only ones that are up double digits. While below their levels from the bear market low, TR and FDP are also two of the only stocks that are simultaneously above levels from February 19, 2020 which marked the last high prior to the start of COVID Crash bear market.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-Below-Bear-Market-Low-1a.png))**

&gt; As for the stocks that have gained the most since the COVID Crash low on 3/23/20, meme mania darling GameStop (GME) still tops the list having rallied 5,492%. That is twice the rally of the next best performer, SM Energy (SM). As for the rest of the top performers since the bear market low, there are another 15 that have gained over 1,000%. One of those is a member of the trillion-dollar market cap club: Tesla (TSLA). Another one of these top performers, Tupperware Brands (TUP), is also one of the only stocks that is actually lower on a year-to-date basis, and those declines are significant at a 43.81% loss. TUP got below $2/share at its lows during the COVID Crash, but then surged back into the mid-$30s in late 2020. It has since moved back down into the teens.

&gt; # Rolling 10-Year Returns Suggest Modest Gains Ahead

&gt; The chart above of the S&amp;P 500 Daily Rolling 10-Year Returns Since 1940 indicates the rolling 10-year average return for the S&amp;P 500 is 6.64% as of the close of October 2021. For the 10-year period ending on October 29, 2021 the average annualized return for the S&amp;P 500 was 13.9%. The highest 10-year annualized return for the S&amp;P 500 since 1940 was 17.2% in August 2000 just after the dotcom bubble burst. Recent 10-year annualized highs occurred in March 2019 at 15.1% and on October 1, 2021 at 14.8%. As you can see from the chart whenever the rolling annualized 10-year returns get into the 15-range the returns over the next 10 years are more modest and trend lower. Gains over the next 10 years are likely to be lower and more in line with the historical averages in the range of 6-9% per year.

&gt; # Best Consecutive Three-Month Span Begins With November

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down 22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQs second worst month on recordonly October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the Best Six Months for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the Best Eight Months for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but dont really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950), Russell 1000 (since 1979) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in all years ranges from 1.7% by S&amp;P 500 to a solid 2.5% by Russell 2000.

&gt; In post-election years, Novembers market prowess is essentially unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 14 of the last 17 post-election years since 1953 with an average gain of 1.9%. DJIA has been up 11-straight post-election year Novembers. DJIAs last losing post-election year November was all the way back in 1973 (-14.0%, Arab oil embargo began 10/19/1973). S&amp;P 500 has been up in 13 of the past 17 post-election years. Small caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 8 of the past 10 post-election years, averaging 2.8%. The only real blemishes in the November post-election year record are 1969 (DJIA 5.1%) and 1973 (DJIA 14.0%, OPEC oil embargo).

&gt; # Typical November Trading: Firm Beginning, Tepid Across Mid-Month, Rally to Close

&gt; As the top month of the year for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979) and second best for DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971), November has historically and frequently been a solid month for equity bulls. In the most recent 21-year period, average gains have even been improving for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. However, strength has not been evenly spread across the entire month.

&gt; As you can see in the following seasonal chart based upon daily performance over the last 21-years, November has typically opened well with nice gains spanning the first four trading days. Following this move higher the major indexes have tended to trade sideways and modestly lower until the last seven trading days at which point, they have historically sprung back to life and surged higher to close out the month. If you missed our Seasonal MACD Buy signal in October and/or are looking for a dip to add to existing positions, November may provide that opportunity.

&gt; # 36,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average started trading more than 125 years ago and yesterday it closed above 36,000 for the first time ever. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 (small caps) all closed at new all-time highs as well.

&gt; We understand all of the worries. Labor shortages, inflation, the pandemic, the Fed, Washington drama, supply chain bottlenecks, and a slowing economy, explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. But the other side of the coin is earnings have been really good and the stock market is looking forward to better times, not looking in the rear view mirror at the bad news.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has hit five separate 1,000 level milestones in 2021, the most ever. Yes, the percentage between each level gets smaller higher you go, but this is still an amazing feat.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.3.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; What now? Well, the bull market looks poised to continue its run. In fact, when the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 20% for the year heading into the seasonally bullish month of November, stocks have never been lowerhigher all eight times. The returns get better as well, up 3.7% versus the average November return of 1.7%. Not to be outdone, the final two months of the year have been higher all eight times as well, up 6.2% versus the average final two months return of 3.2%.

&gt; Were thankful for the strong stock market performance this year, but there may be more to come before year-end. We continue to expect stocks to outperform bonds and maintain our overweight to equities.

&gt; # Historic Run For Consumer Discretionary

&gt; Recently we have made note of the massive outperformance of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Prior to this week, the bulk of the gains were a result of the rise in Tesla (TSLA), but this week, breadth has significantly improved as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. With more stocks in the sector participating in the rally, price has continued to move higher.

&gt; Yesterday marked one month from the recent low in price for the sector. Through yesterday's close, the sector had gained 16.11% over the last month. Moving higher yet again today as of this writing, the sector is now up 17.5% from the low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-SCOND.png))**

&gt; In the chart below, we show the rolling one-month performance of the sector going back to late 1989. As shown, the surge in the past month ranks in the top 1% of readings on record. It has been the largest one-month gain since April of last year when the sector was coming off of the bear market low. Prior to that, the only other period of the post-GFC era to have seen as large of a rally in one month's time was January 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-SCOND-1M.png))**

&gt; With the sector having gone on a historic run over the past month, it begs the question of how much gas may be left in the tank. Historically, when the sector has gained at least 15% in a one-month span without having done so in the prior three months, forward returns have been in line to slightly below average, although they are also not outright negative with positive returns better than half the time. Several of these prior occurrences happened around the time of the Dot Com burst, and performance following those periods was broadly negative.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-S5COND-Table-2.png))**

&gt; This week the sector has also crossed above a 13% weighting in the S&amp;P 500, overtaking Health Care as the second-largest sector in the index!

One of the interesting things is that $CVS just unusual options activity went crazy last monday ratio of open orders to 100 to 1. Call that someone just trying to bet that $CVS will go more than $100 on 11/12 That happened before earnings .

Coincidence? 

Connecting all the dots:

- Manufacturer released a new drug, administered orally , that means , just like Tami-flu you can buy that on retail drug stores with prescription.

- CVS showed up on unusual options activity

- CVS / WBA are specialized in providing the means to give it to the masses .

- $PFE just waiting for approval of the ivermectin-copy

  You can't search hot scenes on Netflix. In fact none of the streaming players has smart search as YouTube.

 They release the same kind of phone every year

 My $300 Pixel 3A has better night vision than 13 pro max. 

 It is better in hardware than Alphabet's Pixel line but their software is pretty dumb. Google maps &gt; Apple Maps. Google search assistant &gt; Siri. Google photos &gt; Apple photos. (No magic eraser). Gmail &gt;Apple mail and the list goes on and on. 

 Not diversified like Alphabet or Microsoft. iPhone is their main source of revenue 

AMAZON

 Serious hiring &amp; retention issues for top talent unlike other big tech. Just search for ""Amazon"" on teamblind.com 

 Retail is 10% tech and 90% slave (labor) management.

 AWS is still top player in cloud but cloud technology is not super difficult like rocket science or FSD and we are seeing Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Cloud catching up to competition.

Yes the risk was a lot but like I said it cannot fail, you have months until expiration and only need the stock to go up barely any. I bought ten contracts just becasue I wanted ot show you can make good money as long as you aren't greedy but you don't need to buy that many contracts, I just wanted to prove my claim. Apple only moved .54 today i still have decent gains. 

Obviously volume and open interest are not the best right now but the closer this contract gets to expiration the contract will become more populated with potential traders. And the difference below shows two options months apart with the bottom being mine and the top one only a month away. For months in differing expiartions this isn't bad and Apple will only pick up during the holidays when evryobw wnats the new iphone and macbook.

As Marketwatch reported this morning (OK, so I guess you actually heard it here second), ""Reddit's 'Apes' have gone bananas and made Dole ... a meme stock.""

I believe it would be theraputic to me to write this out, and I hope some may learn from my mistakes of this year. There was no single yolo gone bad, rather it was the culmination of many mistakes along the way. 


It all started with GME. I had an inherited portfolio of around $200,000, all of which was in mutual funds and highly diversified. I got into GME with $40,000 relatively early at $100 per share, at the peak squeeze my $40k turned to 200k, giving me a total of 400k.


Obviously the squeeze ended when they turned off the buy button, I ended up averaging down with another hundred shares or so, ended up selling it all at around $70, I was left with around $170k as you can see in the screenshot.


My next meme stock was Microvision. I rode that one from $12 all the way up to the high of $28. During the second MVIS peak of June, I had almost made it back up to $300,000, it then dipped below $20 and never came back. I became married to that stock, I averaged down and just continued to diamond hand into oblivion. It crushed my account. I ended up selling at $11. If I were still holding now, my net worth would be below 6 figures.


After selling MVIS at $11, my average cost had become $15 and I had around a 25% loss. This brought me to around $130k. I bought CLF before the most recent earnings and got a sweet 15% profit from that. Up to $150k. Then I bought TDOC before earnings at $140, but my stop loss triggered at $130 the day after earnings, before it rocketed up to $150 without me. Back to $130k.


I became tantalizingly close to riches with Trump's SPAC. I watched the legendary SPAC pump go from $10 rapidly to $15 and beyond, I had a 50k buy order set to trigger at $20, but at the last second, I said ""nah this is dumb"", and I cancelled the order. Had I not cancelled it, and held to the peak, I would have over half a million today.


Missing Trump's SPAC caused me to FOMO hard. Recently, Black Rifle Coffee went public with a SPAC, I assumed it would do the same as Trump's SPAC, you know... conservative pumpers and all that. Ended up losing $10k from that. Down to $120k. 


Most recently I went all in on a small cap squeeze play I wont name here, bought at $28 and averaged up to $32, watched myself recover to $150k yesterday before a brutal 30% dump. And earlier this morning I got out, because enough YOLOing is enough for me. That was my breaking point. And viola! Thats how I got down to $110k.


From now on, its a diversified portfolio of large caps for me, no more big high risk yolos. 


My advice:
Don't get married to a stock, if you're in a clear downtrend, get out. A small loss is better than a big loss.

Set stop losses to lock in your profits, but dont set them too tight during volatile periods such as right after earnings

Don't FOMO into retarded stuff. 

Don't average down, average up. 

Assume a stock going up will continue to go up, and one going down will continue down, don't try to time tops and bottoms.

*The short volume is apparently real. Can't be 100% sure. Read below.

This is not financial advice. My Due Diligence/post may contain mistakes. Do your own due diligence. I have a long position in BMRA in the form of calls atm.

TL;DR: I queried the FINRA API to get the OTC market short volume on BMRA for the 1st October 2021. Short Volume is apparently above 26M shares for that day, which is twice more than the shares oustanding of BMRA: 12.51M according to Yahoo Finance. I wonder how this can be real, I must be missing something.





I can't believe it. I just queried the FINRA api to check myself the data that the creator of this subreddit pinned:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Biomerica_BMRA/comments/qgv1ds/graph_if_overleveraged_short_position_shows/

It seems the short volume numbers are even bigger than that ?

BMRA has shares outstanding of only 12.51M according to Yahoo Finance.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMRA/key-statistics?p=BMRA

The FINRA data shows total shortParQuantity across the 3 TRFs (Trade Reporting Facilities) above 26M shares, more than twice the total amount of shares ???

Still need to do some additional DD to evaluate how significant this really is before I decide whether or not I keep my position though.

1,"11/06/2021, 05:27:25",$COIN will crash after earnings,kg360,"TLDR: Earnings are not going to be good.

Coinbase *seems* like it would be a good play. Earnings last quarter were huge, coin trading is hyped right now, coins are at all time highs, $COIN advertised P/E ratio is very low, etc are all contributing factors to the bull run that $COIN is currently experiencing. Coinbase earnings are releasing the 12th, and it is my opinion that COINBASE earnings will be far lower than expected leading to a large dump.

**Reason 1: Coin prices don't make Coinbase money, but volume does.**

To put things into perspective, I calculated Coinbase's quarterly trading volume in USD. The numbers speak for themselves. (Source: [https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange](https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange)):

Q1: $337,726,593,729

Q2: $456,237,466,410

Q3: $324,071,319,552

**Reason 2: Q2 Earnings were great! Or were they?**

Coinbase's Q1 income before taxes was $996,666,000. After taxes was $771,463,000 (-$225,203,000)

Coinbase's Q2 income before taxes was $868,881,000. After taxes was $1,606,349,000 (+$737,468,000)

Using the ratio of Q1 volume/Q1 income = Q3 volume/Q3 income, Q3 income before tax will likely be around 736,403,266 after tax (956,367,877 before).

Using the ratio of Q2 volume/Q2 income = Q3 volume/Q3 income, Q3 income before tax will likely be around 475,226,528 after tax (617,177,309 before).

How did this happen? Coinbase received a one time tax credit relating to their IPO. Notice the 12% drop in income even though volume was up 35%. Following this trend, Coinbase will need a substantial increase in trade volume to see any growth.

**Reason 3: Dilution**

Q1's earning report shows that there were 126,996,000 diluted shares (79,373,000 basic) used to calculate their EPS. Q2's earning report shows that there were 248,147,000 diluted shares (204,728,000 basic) used to calculate EPS. If this trend continues into Q3, the earnings per share data could be disastrous.

**Reason 4: Insider selling**

On November 2nd, the director at Coinbase sold 77,562 shares of $COIN at prices ranging from $326.28-$344.33. The total sold amount was $25,855,002. Insider selling 10 days prior to an earnings report is probably not a good sign.

1,"11/06/2021, 04:29:37","When in doubt, zoom out: INTC",daftstar,"Hokay friends and ghouls, 

I see a lot of you dumping on INTC. It's a value trap, it's garbage, they missed the boat, they're dependent on TSM, they're a bunch of boomers. Fine. All that's true, but when was all that ever NOT true? And despite them missing the boat all over the place, I'd like to show you all something. 

**When in doubt zoom out.** 

Let's take a trip down crayon avenue.

[Mmm.... that support line. ](https://preview.redd.it/79ityv404ux71.png?width=2900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffb4644f3f76c4836376878a3c87dcc38d61f0ad)

The big chart, that's Intel's price history since 2011. 

Let's look at the red line that slopes upwards. Beginning November 19th, of 2012 and all the way to October 25th, 2021, INTC's tested its support 11-15 times (depending on what you count as testing and re-testing). Either way, every single time it's tested that support line, it's found its way back to life. EVERY TIME. 

Most recently, spring of 2020 when COVID-19 reared its disgusting head. 

After that, October of 2020 when COVID-19 was making another appearance with Delta. 

And most recently October of 2021 when INTC had a bit of a negative earnings surprise. 

All the while, $AMD's been making sweet love to the call holders out there. But you know what, AMD can only hang out with you for so long. Money's gotta go somewhere. How about NVDA? Yep, that's was a money maker galore. But it too's gone parabolic. Where else to put those sweet semi tendies? 

Well, seems like a lot of the big money is putting that money into INTC. 

Why? Well, take a look at the rebound off the support line. 

&amp;#x200B;

[INTC money flow has been trending downwards, except for the past week. Money flow is going back into the stock. Will it get crazy good? I'm not a fortune teller, but these charts are my tarot cards and they're looking pretty good. ](https://preview.redd.it/h70mv75o5ux71.png?width=2860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=551642db068ffdcc22d840c1fcefde65120b0ddc)

I'm not going to share any other crayons than this. 

You can draw your own Fib retracements from April 12th @ $68 - Oct 28th @ $47 and you'll see something like this: The levels are pristine. If INTC is truly going to rebound off the support line like its done since 2011...then things are going to look pretty good over the next couple months. 

[Dammit... I drew the fib. ](https://preview.redd.it/81db3f696ux71.png?width=2870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37d239e93adcb3aca54f0a7d2fe9918d4a026174)

Positions: Boomer style. 

&amp;#x200B;

[It doesn't matter how little I have. One day I'll get this portfolio to Buick bliss. ](https://preview.redd.it/zr7j3ogp6ux71.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d58adb3eea547c604cc299f4b635fee32f2a4f6)

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: INTC long and strong like Donkey Kong.**

WSB seems pretty good at shorts, we were super early on Zillow. Because this is a low float SPAC that ran way above trust price, it represents a very special opportunity to short ahead of the PIPE unlock and front run insiders.

Hopefully you listened to me on the RKLB S-1 effective play as it went down around 20% over the 3 days following the PIPE unlock.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2thtj/rklb\_warning\_s1\_effectivepipe\_unlock\_should/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2thtj/rklb_warning_s1_effectivepipe_unlock_should/)

SPAC PIPE unlock short trades have been extremely profitable. Popular WSB tickers, like iron net, all absolutely nuked on an event called S-1 effective, which happens sometime after a company files it's S-1. When the S-1 is effective, the PIPE investors are able to sell their shares. Because they got a good deal, normally around $8, they often do to lock in a huge profit. That's why all those tickers got absolutely crushed on their PIPE unlocks.

GWH at $18 is way above trust. It filed it's S-1 on November 3rd. This means PIPE unlock is very likely to happen sometime in the next week. So why short now? A lot of people do this trade and love to buy puts. This put trade will trend on social media among the SPAC crowd, I'm 100% certain. This will cause the price to crater before the unlock.

Theyve been achieving excellent results, way above expectations for the last 20 years. Yes 20 years. Constant growth and reinvestment and growing those revenues and building stores at reasonable rates. 10 p/e next year when historical averages show 18x. Thats 80% upside right there. Well some people will say its up 2x from last year. Well guess what, theyve been buying back shares at the craziest rate Ive ever seen. They bought back 15% of the shares last year alone. 5 yr avg fcf is also 180m with 2020 being 293m and 2021 around 330m. 2022 will probably surpass that too. Ive also been reading the reviews on the actual product online too, and people love sleep number beds. 

Its also in oversold territory and its consolidating. Its very simple here, theyre growing EBITDA around 25% a year (forward). Slap a 10% ebitda price on this bad boi and this stock will be trading around 350-400 in 3-4 years time.

One more for you apes. Short interest is 15% theyve also bought back 60% of shares in the last 8 years. Potential squeeze.

Investment case: theyre going to smash expectations like they have been doing for the last 8 years in the fourth quarter (check the history) and analysts will have to upgrade PT.

1,"11/06/2021, 02:53:43",The effect of Elons expiring options on TSLA,Waddayanow,"Papa Elon owned 170,492,985 shares as of end of 2020 and a further 56,638,950 from options expiring in the first two months of 2021. A total of 227,131,935^(1). Total # of shares outstanding was 1,004,000,000 as of Sep 30, 2021^(2).

Furthermore, his 2012 and 2018 Performance Awards continue to vest options as market cap and revenue benchmarks are met. From the 2012 plan Elon has options for 22,862,050 shares exercisable at $6.24 each before Aug 13 2022^(3). Employee options are taxed as ordinary income upon exercise. The recognized income is the difference between the market value of the stock and the strike price, approximately $1,200 per share. This puts his income at a staggering $27.4B. Elon cited a tax rate of 53%, which puts his tax bill to $14.5B. So, lest he decides to let the options expire worthless, he needs to come up with $143M for the strike price and a further $14.5B for Uncle Sam.

The Technoking exercised options before, for example in May 2016 he acquired 5,503,972 shares that were due to expire in December 2016. That transaction was worth $1.1B and Musk sold $600M worth of shares to pay for taxes (and donated $250M to charity to offset some of the taxes)^(4). If we apply the rule of three on his 2016 and 2022 exercise, we can estimate a sale of $14.9B worth of shares until Aug 2022. From the tax rate estimate above, we can project a $14.5B-$15B range.

Elon has two options: borrow from banks at rock-bottom rates collaterizing his existing shares or sell some shares to finance the exercise. A $15B margin loan at IBKR (blended rate of 0.75%) costs $112.5M/year. This is a pretty conservative calculation, but even so Elon is cash-poor, it is not unreasonable to assume that he does not have the cash for it. Assume he chooses to sell shares instead (and he might already be doing it, slowly), he needs to part with $12.5M shares. It is hard to gauge the effect the sale will have on the share price. As a volume it does not seem much, the daily trade volumes were hovering around 10M before the recent run-up. Also the free float is 81.31%, or 816M shares, so around 1.5% of the free float will be sold. But superficial media reports of Elon selling will cause retail panic.

All in all, a definitive downward pressure until the end of Q1, by the time Elon will probably want this to be over with.

Keep in mind this 1:1 ratio as we continue, as it applies to all situational things in this absolutely mad scenario. This will be at the start of 2022, 5 years after 2017. 

It's 2021 now. 2+0+2+1 = 5. First we'll subtract that 5 from the ""Movement year"" of our scenario.
2021 - 5 = 2016 and If we add 1 (for years into this decade) to 2016 we get 2017. In 2017 stock prices kept going up.. it was a good year. But now what happened in 2018? A great stock market crash where the DOW fell 5.6% in a year. Notice the 5 and the 6 here. The 5 comes first, just like 2021 comes before 2022, and the 2017 market came before the 2018 market.

Since we are currently in the ""5 zone"" (having not reached 2022) we can go to the 1st iteration of 2021's 5-zone trend, a.k.a the year 2017. The market kept going up, just like this year. And we would expect this in 2021 based on the position of the 5 in 5.6% 

However upon reaching 2022 we'll be entering the 6th year, or what I'd like to call the ""5+1, or 6 zone"" to see what happens here is easy. 2+0+2+2 = 6, so let's look at the second part of the equation, 2022. Since 2022 is taking the ""6"" position, we'll subtract 2022 - 6 = 2016. 

Now we'll add 2 (for 2nd year into this decade) to see that 
2016 + 2 =2018, our position of 6 in 5.6% should suggest that 2022 mirrors 2018, given everything situational exists in a 1:1 ratio. 

If 2022 mirrors 2018, we can expect big dumps in stock prices while the world slowly burns in the face of environmental and social collapse.

While we are not suggesting that $BBBY is the next $RH dont tell that to Mark Tritton who wants to be the next Gary Friedman.

There are clear parallels from this aggressive move by $BBBY with $RH four years ago.

1. Management and the BOD believe the stock is highly undervalued
2. This aggressive buyback shows there are no liquidity concerns
3. The shareholder structure is more concentrated than the market appreciates (e.g., 42% of $BBBY shares outstanding are held by the top 3 holders BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard)

**Analysts and investors can see in the latest $BBBY 10-Q filing that the company has completed the initial $600 million tranche of this buyback at an average price of $25 while repurchasing stock in tranches as high as $29 (i.e., 50% higher).** 

No one knows the intrinsic value of this company more than this board same $RH argument and they believe the stock is undervalued even at $29.

Applying a 5x EBITDA multiple on 2024 EBITDA of $800 million to $1 billion we arrive at a price target of $50 to $70, so can see why management sees value here.

1,"11/06/2021, 01:19:30",LCID behaves like AMC did in May,Hellotherefriend99,"
Welcome to my extensive and detailed technical analysis of Lucid Group ( LCID ).

Lucid Group caught my eye because of its similarity to AMC Entertainment in May 2021.
A comparison I show at the end of this analysis.

This analysis is very extensive and detailed and I show several bullish formations in the most diverse time windows. 

The following time windows are discussed:

Weekly Chart
Four hours chart
Hourly Chart


To each analysis there will be a linked idea, so there is the possibility to judge individual analyses retrospectively using the play button function at TradingView (timestamp).

Let's start.

1. weekly chart

In the weekly chart, we can see and project different bullish patterns. 
As seen in this analysis, a W formation has formed (white lines), which is currently in a so-called retest.
This retest can trigger a correction phase that can continue to the Fibonacci lines 0.236, 0.382, 0.618 and maximum to 0.786.
Typically, corrections are made to 0.236, 0.382.
The formation becomes invalid only when the price falls below the lowest point of the W formation. 

The target of this formation can be divided into three targets.
Target 1 measured from the middle high to the ""neckline"".
Target 2 measured from the Left Low to the ""Neckline"".
Target 3 measured from the right low to the ""neckline"".

Thus, the following price targets result from this formation: (purple lines)
Target 1 53.54 USD
Target 2 66.13 USD
Target 3 76.05 USD

What is exciting here is that the chart at 64.82 USD, similar to AMC Entertainment back then can form a Superior W Formation, with targets of: (Blue lines)
100.08 USD
112.49 USD
113.58 USD

If one takes the trend-based Fibonacci Extensions to the help, one can determine additional Max targets that could be reached with strong sustained volume, and according to Elliot waves could define the target of wave 3. The targets are here, at the following price values: (Yellow lines)

159.66 USD
214.49 USD
248.38 USD



2. four hours chart

In the four-hour chart, we can see an Inverted Shoulder Head Shoulder Formation, which has already reached its target of 41.41 USD. 
An Inverted Shoulder Head Shoulder Formation is a sign of a trend reversal and hereby signals us the end of the correction phase that has lasted since 18.02.2021.
After reaching the target and a subsequent correction phase, the price very often rises back to the price target of the Inverted SKS (Superior Retest of the W Formation from the weekly chart) and continues the upward movement.





3. hourly chart 

In the hourly chart, we see a Bearish SKS that has its target at 30.33USD. (0.382 Fibonacci area from the weekly chart).
Overarching the possibility exists that a harmonic pattern is formed ( Gartley Formation ).
The Gartley Formation is to be considered as a trend-following pattern and gives the following price targets from point D ( 30.62 USD ): (Blue lines)

Target 1 34.78 USD
Target 2 37.40 USD
Target 3 44.65 USD

All these formations give me personally a good feeling that Lucid Group has a lot of potential upside in the long term.





Finally, I would like to show you a comparison picture to AMC Entertainment, immediately after my analysis at that time, the price of AMC Entertainment rose impulsively to the current all-time high at 77.30USD.

1,"11/06/2021, 01:12:49",Options are NOT dangerous,dmitsuki,"A lot of post I see now keep parroting over and over that options are really dangerous, because you can lose all your money. That isn't any more true than it is with stocks. If you are an idiot and just do random shit with your money you can lose it all. The counter argument to this might be ""but you can lose your money a lot faster with options than with stocks,"" to which I say ""I dare you go naked short a tech stock and tell me how safe your capital is."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The entire idea that options are intrinsically dangerous comes from the usage of FD's in this sub. Options are a leverage tool, and as a leverage tool can be abused heavily to enter into insane binary positions that will either get you a lambo or or make you a lame ho. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, considering this is WSB, I completely condone this behavior. But please don't go around telling everyone this is fundamentally what options are for. The entire idea behind an option being able to ""lose all your money"" makes it \*safer\* than a stock. Look at this nifty graph I found with 2 seconds of duckduckgo

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The lines aren't even fucking straight](https://preview.redd.it/quntmg8e6tx71.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50ef23df533e937a81a769fe582e58d20ad5cea6)

You can clearly see from this crayon drawing that a long call is the same thing as a long stock, except the red part doesn't go as far down as the long stock. Why? Because you are always liable to lose everything on a stock, versus the \*equivalent\* options trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

A call for example represents you controlling 100 shares. It doesn't cost you the same as 100 shares though. If you look at the delta, that is, the variable that represents how close to one dollar in change you get for one dollar change in the stock (For example, if your delta is .8, for every 1 dollar the stock moves, you get .8 dollars, times 100) as delta tends towards 1 you are in mathematically the same trade as holding 100 stocks (that's why the green lines are the same) but if the stock goes down you are only liable for the cost of the option, whereas stocky mc fuckwad who bought shares can lose the entirety of the value of 100 shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is the part where you snicker at me and go ""heh, but look dmitsuki, if I hold shares I have not realized a loss, meaning I can still make my money back at any moment, but with the option I have realized a loss and am financially ruin"" 

&amp;#x200B;

The obviously response to this is, that is only true if you literally bet 100% of your money in options. In other words, you have over-leveraged yourself. I said it cost less to do the same trade, that didn't mean you go and then buy MORE because you have money left over you fucking idiot. If that's what you want to do, buying stocks wouldn't matter in the first place because you would probably use all your margin to buy some fucking stock anyway and be confused as to why you got liquidated even though the stock went to 0. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anything becomes dangerous when you put yourself in a position where a move against you makes your account 0 and you can no longer trade. That's what risk management is for. If you want to laugh and say ""risk management is for suckers, high raises or dumpsters"" then fine, but don't act like the financial tool you are exploiting is at fault because it can technically be used as a degenerate gambling tool.

Also for those of you who are experiencing something similar, I want you to know you can make it. So without further ado, here is my story (proof).

https://ibb.co/3r1pNVX

For every gains porn post someone out there is on the other end with a loss. I can still remember when the GME runup began. I was so sure it would blow over in a day, and I picked up 10k in 3 month out puts just as GME crested 40 dollars. I remember as it skyrocketed I even found myself up on my position as the I/V grew. But I wanted more and I was so sure it would be back to 4 dollars in a month or two. Lesson one, don't get too smart, and don't fight the market.

Well, a few months rolled by and the expiration on my options was getting close, they had slashed in value down to a third and even though GME had fallen, they weren't worth what I paid for them. I could have cut my losses and been out about 5k. But this is where I made my second mistake. Trading options on emotion. I couldn't believe my puts were priced correctly so I rolled them out a few more months, and aggressively. My position was now 50k instead of 10k. I couldn't let go of my ego and take the loss.

Well, as fate would have it, a few days later GME would rip back up into the 200s. My freshly rolled position, started collapsing, and fast. I remember sitting at work every day, constantly pulling out my phone and staring at the GME ticker, waiting for any drop, hoping to be saved. But, my salvation never came, and my position got worse and worse. Enter my third mistake, doubling down. At this point I was desperate. I wanted, needed, to make my money back, so I averaged down, and averaged down again. My position was now worth just over 100k.

With each passing day, my position ticked down in value. I remember one day so vividly as I saw my losses pile up into the 80k range I noticed sharp pain in my chest. It had been getting harder and harder every day, and the extreme stress was taking a toll on my body. I held on for a few more days, but the pain was getting worse, and I was literally shaking (tm), from the stress. Finally I called it. I closed my position down a total of just over 100k. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. 

As pathetic as this sounds, I remember actually crying several times thinking about what an idiot I was. When you lose that kind of money, and for me this wasn't play money, it takes you to a dark place. I remember ringing in my head over and over, what was I thinking, how could I make such a mistake. It was one of my lowest points ever, and it felt like I would never feel normal again, anyone who has been in my shoes knows what I'm talking about.

Well, it's been 7 months sense then and I will never touch an option again. I know now that I have a gambling problem and I can't put myself in that kind of position. It has been hard, to come to terms with losing something I spent many years of my life building, but I have made it through. To anyone who is where I was, right now, I know how it feels, and I promise you the age old adage, time heals all wounds is true, it does get easier.

### Is $BBBY taking a page out of the $RH Playbook?

On November 2, $BBBY announced that it was accelerating its $1 billion three-year share repurchase program to now be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. The last time we saw a buyback this aggressive and bullish was from Citron favorite RH when the co. announced a $700 million buyback authorization in May 2017 when the stock was trading at $52. Two months later, RH completed the buyback and you know the rest of the story.

While we are not suggesting that $BBBY is the next $RH dont tell that to Mark Tritton who wants to be the next Gary Friedman.

There are clear parallels from this aggressive move by $BBBY with $RH four years ago.

1) Management and the BOD believe the stock is highly undervalued

2) This aggressive buyback shows there are no liquidity concerns

3) The shareholder structure is more concentrated than the market appreciates (e.g., 42% of $BBBY shares outstanding are held by the top 3 holders BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard)

**Analysts and investors can see in the latest $BBBY 10-Q filing that the company has completed the initial $600 million tranche of this buyback at an average price of $25 while repurchasing stock in tranches as high as $29 (i.e., 50% higher).**

No one knows the intrinsic value of this company more than this board same $RH argument and they believe the stock is undervalued even at $29.

Applying a 5x EBITDA multiple on 2024 EBITDA of $800 million to $1 billion we arrive at a price target of $50 to $70, so can see why management sees value here.

1. Disney fucking prints money. Especially if inflation goes out of control, you want to put your money in companies that print serious cash rather than in high growth companies. Diversify yourself from all the Tesla and other high growth companies.

2. Recovery stocks are the hottest rage still. You think Americans give a fuck about covid anymore? Disney upped the hell out of their Disney world tickets, AND PEOPLE STILL GOING TO BUY IT. Reminds of you of something? Yeah, Apple and their iPhones. Everyone and they mother is going to Disney world this fall and winter break.

3. ""Technical analysis"". Disney stock completely flat this year, every other company up 40%. I actually don't know any TA, but obviously this means that Disney gonna take off soon.

4. They have declining growth headwinds on their Disney+ subscribers. CEO already announced that, so the stock is already priced in for it.

Hey all,

I tried really hard in the beginning and will randomly get the inspiration/the anger resurfaces of the late jan RH nonsense.

Long story short, I had NOK calls that were up 100%+ then in the middle of the night RH announced you can no longer buy shares of nokia, ONLY SELL. Immediately, my heart sank waiting for markte to open the next day. The next day I lost all my profit and half my investment. In an emotional chase, I tried to avg down, losing more and more money, ending up selling for a 7k loss as it became clear there'd be no coming back.

1,"11/06/2021, 00:30:19",$GME God reveals the secret behind $BBBY,lil_Dik_ThRoBn_stock,"Think like this;
(hypothetical stats): There are 100M shares outstanding. Only 30M of those are free floating (they change hands on occasion and aren't tucked away in long-term no touch places). Shorts create another 20M float leveraged out. So all the price action you know is the result of 50M float, not reality of 100M outstanding (or 120M aggregate).

BBBY reduced this by like 8M (don't recall exactly). So now you're at 22M float, 42M agg float. If BBBY buys back another $300M at $20/each, that's 15M purchased, reducing to 7M float, 27M agg float.
1) you'd expect that buybacks will lift the price by executing. It's very doubtful they could reduce real float that much without substantial increase in price (especially given their willingness to buy at $30 already (share adjusted that's like $33) and avgs mean they may have ALREADY been buyers are higher prices).
2) every price increase and for long enough, cause margin calls and a retraction in aggregate float (shorts close).
3) that ratio (float to agg float) is increasing exponentially, meaning squeezes become more explosive.
[10:38 AM]
So your fundamentals support a $40-60/sh stock and the mechanics of this market with buybacks make an absolute explosive upside. The risk/reward is ASTOUNDING.

And I don't doubt what is my knowledge will become more peoples' knowledge, causing a ""town center"" effect... self-perpetuating a squeeze.

cross your fucking fingers this shit dips one last time.

THEN MORTGAGE THE FUCKING HOUSE.

Been trading PTON since May 2020, first bought at $43.55. Taken some profits along the way &amp; sold all remaining positions today. I think in total this trade netted me $76k gain, not so bad but it's such a roller coster! LOL",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnepx6/pton_rip/

What I know:

-Pfizer has achieved tremendous success with its COVID-19 vaccine: Comirnaty. It continues to be the leading mRNA vaccine worldwide.

-Merck was unsuccessful in its quest to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. But, it has emerged as the first pharmaceutical company to debut its anti-viral oral treatment, Molnupiravir.

- Merck: Based on the data in the companys release, the drug appears to have a clean safety profile, meaning there were no serious side effects in trial volunteers.

- Merck: The research, which was conducted in the U.S. and other countries, also suggests the drug would be effective against mutations of the virus that the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) classifies as variants of concern, including the Delta, Gamma, and Mu mutations. 

-Doctors emphasized that if and when molnupiravir is authorizedand even if it is as successful in real-world scenarios as it was in the studyvaccination will remain essential for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infectionand for slowing its spread. People who are vaccinated have a much lower chance of getting sick and needing any treatment, they say.

- Pfizer results appear to surpass those seen with Mercks pill ,molnupiravir, which was shown last month to halve the likelihood of dying or being hospitalized for COVID-19 patients also at high risk of serious illness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnek0e/merck_or_pfizer/

I understand that when the option expires, I have the right to buy shares at the price at expiration for the strike price. What if I don't have the money in my account to cover the strike price? What happens then? Does RH immediately buy &amp; sell the option &amp; give me the difference? It's quite a bit of money to purchase the option at the strike price: $21,500.

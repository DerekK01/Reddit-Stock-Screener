1,"11/23/2021, 23:55:41",$GOEV - Using an American EV maker to Protect Your Portfolio against Inflation and Interest Rate Hikes,invest_opinions,"**Silverline: Everything will be more expensive in 2022 and 2023, from water&amp; sandwiches to cars. GOEV has converted a lot a cheap cash in something that will increase in value - an EV factory.** 

The American EV maker, Canoo ($GOEV) is a popular stonk again, but this time they are not anymore a company wit many power points but a serious EV maker with pretty good achievements. 

Now if you want to read more in-depth about their positive developments you might want to read this post from [u/Rivaaal/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rivaaal/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvelet/canoo\_is\_about\_to\_burn\_the\_shorts\_goev\_walmart/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvelet/canoo_is_about_to_burn_the_shorts_goev_walmart/) 

**But the main fear -** driver in the market these days **is Inflation.** Marketwatch, WS and others are pushing daily a lot of articles on best defensive for inflation. 

**Surprising enough - stocks like $GOEV are the best defensive against inflation!**

Here is why: 

The hardware investment for Canoo has been already made (some 90%). They used all the cheap cash they could get in 2020-2021 to build production facilities in Oklahoma and  Arkansas (blink blink - home of Wallmart), to secure a contract for battery supply with Panasonic, and even to bring the first product on the market with 6m sooner: from early 2023 as planned to q3 2022!

**They squeezed a little bi more cash to pick the best locations betting over 400M in incentives from state level.** 

 Now, the very first Lifestyle car expected in 2022 will cost some 35K, **BUT** if the BB bill will pass the Senate with EV incentives intact inside, **a Canoo Lifestyle Car will only cost you about 23-25K(after grant from Fed Gov) and it will be built in US. It will have some 300 miles autonomy and suv comparable power. Compete with that!** 

Now, what do you think you happen next year? 

Any official estimation of 2022 inflation is showing a spike in price, from water to energy, to food and obviously to cars. Even used cars a lot more expensive now and will continue to be.

Workers are expecting more perks and payment raises in 2022 too - [https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/careers/salaries/603709/workers-expect-higher-salaries-and-more-perks-in-2022](https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/careers/salaries/603709/workers-expect-higher-salaries-and-more-perks-in-2022)

With all that it is obvious that inflation will make your dollars cheaper. ***That usually  happens and that is one reason we keep our money invested, right?*** 

Now - the main thing is : any competitor willing to build an EV factory in US in 2022 or beyond will have to pay with 20+% more. The spike in construction materials, metals, electronics, etc are already even more expensive than that. 

**With higher inflation, sooner or later we can expect an interest rate hike, right? While this could cool the price runup a little, this also means that any investment made by another EV company will cost more because of the borrowing rates.** 

$GOEV (Canoo) is not the only smart company that has placed all that cheap cash from pandemic in something  solid and valuable. 

But certainly Canoo is one of the smartest to do so, using excess cash from the market to build a cash machine!

1,"11/23/2021, 23:52:29",$GGPI Polestar - Global EV Pure Play - DD,rymor,"Greetings, lads. Elons TweetThreats and PP posts aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following

* Rivian IPO blew up. Share price $110. Now $98B market cap.
* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,190. Now $1.2T MC.
* Lucid +100% in three weeks. SP $52. Now $86B MC.

Like you, SoFi didnt fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the $LCID  $15 dip. And sadly, I wasnt able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years  ago.

But heres our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV pure plays in the market:

Polestar  Volvos EV spinoff brand  estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.

Its now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.

Polestar is the only global EV pure play, other than Tesla.

**History**

A little background

* Polestar takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris  not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. Thats *Polstjrnan* (literal translation, Pole Star) if youre Swedish.
* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvos partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.
* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.
* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being independent since 2017.
* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.
* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.

**Comps**

**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**

* Applying Teslas 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.
* Applying Lucids 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.

**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**

* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.
* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:

1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).
2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.

* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.
* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.
* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.

**The EV Graveyard**

The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.

But Polestar?

They've   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How  many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when  they IPOd? Answer: 1,400.

Polestar just makes cars, baby.

CEO Thomas Ingenlath: We have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.

Claim confirmed. And look at that jawline.

**The Product**

The Polestar 1 came out in 2019. Its a hybrid premium sports car that will set you back $155K 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph. Theyre badass, and hard to find.

**Polestar 2**

The Polestar 2 launched in 2020. Polestar 2 What is it?

Think Subaru Outback meets the Model 3  with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic. Its a sedan, but its higher ride- height and rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a   hatchback. Lets call it a crossover coupe. Available now.

**Upcoming Polestar lineup**

* Polestar 3 (2022)  luxury electric SUV built in the USA at Volvos South Carolina factory. Polestar also hopes to have the South Carolina vehicles be union-made no easy task these days (looking at you, Austin   Elon).
* Ingenlath (CEO): ""Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American customers. I remember the great response when I first shared Polestar's vision here in the USA and I am proud that our first SUV will be manufactured in South Carolina. From now on, the USA is no longer an export market but a home market.""

**Political / Regulatory Tailwinds**

The US and global political environment has never been more positive for investment in electric vehicles.

Last week, the House of Representatives voted 228-206 to pass the Build Back Better infrastructure bill totaling $1.2 trillion. This is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.

Relevant highlights:

* The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.
* Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.
* An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.

**Brand Rollout**

While watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series a couple weeks ago, I saw this TV commercial:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk)

* It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.
* Launched ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human advancement, the way we live now and the damage we're doing to the   planet.
* Nyberg: ""Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.

***Cramer on $GGPI:***

* Theyre connected with Polestar. OK, heres the problem: Rivian is coming public. This group has gotten a little too hot. Lets let things cool off before we get hurt.

Ok,  Cramer has a point here, but not necessarily about GGPI. Your downside risk on LCID, TSLA, RIVN is technically limitless. GGPI on the other hand, has a NAV (net asset value) floor of approximately $10 until merger.

Well, we dont know a lot about Leos investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:

* \[CEO\] Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake DiCaprio \[has\] in  the  company. One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is sustainability, Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. Its as well very important for Leo. He and us being joined on that journey, him   investing in our company, obviously that makes sense for both sides.

**TL;DR** $GGPI is taking Swedish EV auto maker Polestar public. The cars are sexy AF, and match up well with the Tesla Model 3 on both performance and price. Polestar has 29K cars on the road and $1.5B in  revenue in FY21, and still trades at a deep discount to other EV pure  plays.

Despite its success in building brand recognition, it was uncertain whether a substantial market niche existed for Pets.com.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com#cite_note-cheyfitz-22) No independent market research preceded the launch of Pets.com.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com#cite_note-cheyfitz-22) During its first fiscal year (February to September 1999) Pets.com earned $619,000 in revenue, and spent $11.8 million on advertising.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com#cite_note-cheyfitz-22) Pets.com lacked a workable business plan and lost money on nearly every sale because, even before the cost of advertising, it was selling merchandise for approximately one-third the price it paid to obtain the products.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com#cite_note-cheyfitz-22) Pets.com tried to build a customer base by offering discounts and free shipping, but it was impossible to turn a profit while absorbing the costs of shipping for heavy bags of cat litter and cans of pet food within a business field whose conventional profit margins are only two to four percent.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com#cite_note-cheyfitz-22)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com#cite_note-haig-23) The company hoped to shift customers into higher-margin purchases, but customer purchasing patterns failed to change and during its second fiscal year the company continued to sell merchandise for approximately 27% less than cost, so the dramatic rise in sales during Pets.com's second fiscal year only hastened the firm's demise.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com#cite_note-cheyfitz-22)

Benchmark: Dapper Labs, the company behind popular fantasy basketball NFT game NBA Top Shot, is now worth more than $7.6 billion, while The9 City is now only $200 million.

Bottom line: **The9 City has $130 million cash + $13 million worth of coins**, and its market cap is just about $200 million. If The9 City becomes the first listed company with NFT platform, the valuation will go up multiple **TIMES**.

1,"11/23/2021, 23:32:23",$UPH DD,Quiet_Spite_3221,"Heading into third quarter earnings, Uphealth  (UPH) was a bet on whether there was a real thriving company buried under the noise from their disastrous de-spac process.  The quarter exceeded all expectations and provided clear evidence that this is a company that is both firing on all cylinders and dirt cheap.  

For those new to the story, Uphealth is what happens when a fine company meets a botched capital markets process.  Uphealth is an emerging leader in several lines of global digital health solutions.  The company is organized around three segments  Integrated Care Platform, Virtual Care Infrastructure, and Services.  Integrated Care provides a HIPAA compliant solution to coordinate complex, chronic care services with advanced analytics and evidence-based protocols to empower the shift towards value-based outcomes for patients.  This should be an exciting growth area as regulations and reimbursement models increasingly move towards this model.  Virtual Care Infrastructure provides remote telehealth solutions.  Cloudbreak has the largest provider footprint of any telehealth solution and differentiates itself with translation services for 200 languages.  Glocal is a fast growing remote care solution providing remote monitoring, diagnostics, labs, and drug dispensing in developing markets.  Glocal is a twenty-first century solution for nations building healthcare infrastructure unburdened by legacy structures.  Finally, the Services segment provides a high-service compounding pharmacy and Behavioral Health solutions  both of which have powerful synergies with Integrated Care.

Last week, Uphealth reported its first clean quarter as a public company and knocked the ball of the park.  Revenue of 49.1MM grew 25% quarter-over-quarter with gross margins expanding to 40% from 36% in Q2 2021.  Full-year revenue guidance was reaffirmed at $180MM which implies that 4Q21 will provide $61MM of revenue or another 22% of quarter-over-quarter growth from Q3.  Management stated that 2022 revenues will grow by at least 50% and that growth was constrained far more more by bandwidth and working capital than demand.  Uphealth is AEBITDA profitable today and should generate at least $15-20MM AEBITDA in2021 and at least $35-40MM in 2022.  Moreover, I believe that after a painful introduction to public markets, management has learned the game and is establishing forward hurdles they know they can beat and raise.  Even with the need for working capital to support growth, they they have sufficient capital to meet their growth plans and will be generating positive operating cash flows by Q2 next year.  Over 60% of the business is under multi-year recurring revenue contracts which provides stability and visibility into future results.

At $3 this is a company which is trading at only 2x revenues for 50%-75% forward revenue growth, 40% and expanding gross margins.  This is almost unheard of in todays markets.  The opportunity here comes from one of the more botched de-spac processes we have ever seen.  The SPAC which merged with UPH was an early issue from June 2019.  SPACs have two years to consummate a deal at which time they must redeem the trust, leaving the SPAC sponsor with accumulated expenses and a massive foregone opportunity.  The Uphealth deal was down to the wire in June 2021 but that was a time when SPAC sentiment was at a low.  This was a complicated multi-way merger which was not well explained to investors and was on the expensive side out of the gate at $10.  To get the deal done, the SPAC sponsor turned to some creative financing mechanisms which secured their promote but set the stock up for technical trouble right out of the gate.  First, the cash component of the deal was largely funded with convertible debt instead of straight PIPE equity.  This led to immediate selling pressure as the convertible holders hedged their positions.  Second, the company accumulated short term liabilities and was undercapitalized from the start which led to the need for a secondary offering to clean up the capital structure just four months after the de-spac.  The secondary was telegraphed from miles away, and by the time it was executed, capital markets extracted their pound of flesh and the company raised funds at $1.75/share.  

But the pain of the past is what makes this so exciting for investors today.  Few things are as profitable for investors as when the price of a security has been temporarily divorced from fundamental value due to purely technical and transitory factors.  Management did a great job explaining their model on the third quarter call and is rapidly moving up the learning curve of how to operate as a public company.  Any peer company with these growth and gross profitability metrics would trade for at least 5x revenue which would imply a stock price of $7.75 or \~250% above todays price.  If we are correct that Uphealth is setting itself a very conservative 2022 hurdle to establish credibility with investors, and 2022 revenues are closer to $300-$310, then 5x revenues would be a price of $8.75 or \~300% upside.  If Uphealth can maintain its pace of growth  and they play in massive TAM markets  then tremendous upside exists beyond these levels.

The capital structure of the company was right-sized with the October secondary and with these technical overhangs out of the way, Uphealths price will now begin to reflect its true fundamental value which is very promising indeed.  At this price investors should be very well rewarded as that happens.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0fs6j/uph_dd/

This could get your wife back from her bf.,FikerGaming,"So Inovio haramaceutics was a small company who was ridding the HUGE 2020 covid wave and was playing ball with the big guys, like phfizer. It was on a race to get the covid vaccine to the market, but its stock was falling, this was because it was struggling  to get its covid DNA vaccine (INO 4800) past the mid stage of testing and then the regulatory bodies put a pause on any further testing. effectively handicapping the company. The regulators wanted to gather more information about the vaccine and the delivery method.

After a long review the FDA has finally given approval to Inovia to continue with its studies on its phase 3 trails,   which makes USA the 7'th country to allow it. So because  of these good news analysts price targets are incredibly  high! Its currently trading at 6.8$ and the analysts price target is 17.25! Which more then 150% upside! and on the higher end they are putting a price target of 35!

The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when. The Global Risk Institute released a report titled ""Quantum Threat Timeline"" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034. Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.



For reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date. A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to ""harvest now, decrypt later"" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available.



It has even been theorized that the entire chain that digital assets depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity. This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data. Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.



The technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come. The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch.



With current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year. To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO himself.To land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an ""unnamed"" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.



During recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company. Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.



In addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already. The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%. If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1



billion market cap. It also would appear, counter to many of the recent SPAC IPOs, that dilution should not be an issue going forward. In the SPAC transaction, the company has received $376 million in cash to the balance sheet, to which the CEO recently commented that the deal brought it ""twice the money that we need to fully fund our business"" and that ""We don't need to raise any more money, ever,"" he told CNBC. In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.



So far, I have not found any true red flags with Arqit, but as I am not a cybersecurity expert, I will be keeping my position moderately sized until at least a few quarters have run off and I gain a greater comfortability with the progress of the technology and management. I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed. If they are successful in the product roll out, shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely. I look forward to your comments and views of the company, thank you for reading and good luck!

Hi All. I found this new DD on Stocktwits today.

[PIPP \(Biden Spac\) New DD](https://preview.redd.it/9lh8zjselc181.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2822b0a64becbb95b292158c623b1bda50327821)

Hello Pippers!

I believe we are finally on the verge of a major announcement from PIPP. Heres why:

While many traders are combing through the recent quarterly doing their due diligence (which they should), I myself have concluded that the audit of all financials by PIPP management and their Audit committe is a MAJOR indicator that a merger target has been selected. Both PIPP and the target are combing through the financials to ensure they are 100% accurate. 

But why? Heres my due diligence.

After a SPAC merges with a private operating company (the target), the targets financial statements become those of the combined public company (the combined company). 

Therefore, a target will need to devote a considerable amount of time and resources to technical accounting and reporting matters.

It is stressed the importance of oversight by both the corporate board and the audit committee to ensure that a company provides high-quality financial reporting. 

An audit committee should be composed of individuals with the appropriate skills and background to oversee the SPAC transaction and combined company.

You can learn more here: https://dart.deloitte.com/USDART/home/publications/deloitte/financial-reporting-alerts/2020/spac-transactions

In summary, the review process for ther SPAC merger is very thorough and rigorous. I believe everything occurring now is preparation and imho now that the financials have been audited, we could literally hear an announcement any day now. Due to the holiday season coming up, ill say within 30 days. 

While many people have opinions on the actual target company (Starlink, Sierra, SparkCognition), nobody knows and imho its irrelevant right now. As we all know PIPPs board of directors and partners are stacked with some incredible people and that no other SPAC has this level of access and intimacy into the niche they are targeting. IMHO whomever they merge with is going to DAZZLE investors. Whys that important? 

AS Ive recently stated, the massive accumulation by major institutions is another MAJOR SIGNAL that something big is coming SOON! About 9 months ago, institutions owned roughly 25% of PIPP. 3 months ago, they owned roughly 35%. Now they own 44.66% of the available shares. The top 25 hedge funds and institutions collectively now own 58.2% of the available shares leaving around 11 million shares available for retail investors.

Do your own due diligence and come to your own conclusions.

Happy Trading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0dd0u/pipp_biden_spac_due_diligence/

My team of quants have crunched the numbers. Simulations confirm our hypothesis; A digital money printer, like that operated by the FED, can be manufactured by any community through the action of simply *""liking""* **one** stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some facts:

* **$HOOD's** average volume is [**7,359,061**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD/#:~:text=Avg.%20Volume-,7%2C359%2C061,-Market%20Cap) and their last price was $**27.79**
* wallstreetbets has **11.2m** members
* 11.2m people market smashing **10** shares each would move **30%** of the float

&amp;#x200B;

This is how we add a little spice to the game:

1. You can only invest in $HOOD and you must use the Robinhood app
2. You must always max margin buying $HOOD
3. Tell your family/friends/peers about the one way ticket to Tendieville
4. Challenging easily impressionable strangers to see who can obtain the most $HOOD
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until 100% of $HOOD's float is held on Robinhood

&amp;#x200B;

Now Robinhood has traders that only hold $HOOD in their Robinhood account, making Robinhood's collateral 100% itself. What's Vlad going to do now, liquidate your $HOOD shares to meat *Robinhood's* obligations? Fuck no, **the price only goes up now.** A single share of $HOOD becomes collateral for infinite trendies at you favorite Wendy's.

ADSK has a market cap of 68 Billion while zoom had 69 billion (before earnings).

Zoom had a revenue multiple of 17.7x (before earnings) while Autodesk has an earnings multiple of 16.9x. Similar P/E of 50, etc...

These are both priced as growth stocks, but their growth is waning. Software companies just don't change their pricing fast enough to keep up with inflation. Often critical business software like this is licensed for years at a time for discounts. Their growth also doesn't scale with inflation. 

Autodesk is Computer aided design software, requires a decent amount of technical knowledge. Most of the people using this software have an undergraduate degree in engineering, and the supply of people like that is limited. Engineering positions grow 3-5% per year. At least with zoom any living breathing person can use zoom.

1,"11/23/2021, 20:37:23",Why compound interest is such a powerful tool?,faralight," I remember very well in 2016, as a fresh graduate in law, I was analyzing the companies stock and I did not understand why 1 million dollars at 20% interest after 10 years accumulates to $6,191,000.74.

More than 600%, as I was taught at school, if interest is 20% that means you can expect $200,000 every year and after ten years you will get 3 million dollars, but there are $6,191,000.74. How? Furthermore interesting.

It is really shocked me. You know, it turns out the compound interest is what happens when you reinvest your earnings, which then earn interest as well. Compound interest essentially means ""interest on the interest"" and is the reason many investors are so successful.

Think of it this way. Let's say you invest $10,000 at 20% interest. After the first year, you receive a $2,000 interest payment.

But, instead of putting it in your pocket, you reinvest it at the same 20% rate. For the second year, your interest is calculated on a $14,400 investment, which comes to $4400.

If you reinvest that, your third-year interest will be calculated on a $17,280 balance. After ten years your $10,000 accumulates to $60,191.74.

After 20 years you will have $383,376 in your balance. I'd like to say just Oh my god.

Compound interest is such a powerful tool that Albert Einstein once called it the most important invention in all of human history.

So that's why banks dont provide loans in compound interest because it doesnt benefit them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0ca2l/why_compound_interest_is_such_a_powerful_tool/

1,"11/23/2021, 15:41:12",Why Shares of Niu Technologies Are Crashing Today,serefsiz,"**Niu Technologies** reported third-quarter earnings today, and it failed to charge up the market's excitement. To the chagrin of investors, the electric scooter manufacturer failed to meet analysts' top- and bottom-line expectations.

As of 12:51 p.m. ET on Monday, shares of Niu were down 16%.

## So what

Niu Technologies reported sales of 1.2 billion yuan ($187.7 million) for the third quarter, a 37.1% year-over-year increase. But investors had higher hopes for the company, and were disappointed that it didn't meet analysts' estimate of 1.4 billion yuan. The earnings were a sore spot on the income statement as well. Analysts expected earnings per share (EPS) of 1.18 yuan, but the company reported EPS of only 0.57 yuan.

While international sales had been a driving force behind the company's growth[ over the summer](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/16/why-shares-of-niu-technologies-are-racing-higher-o/), foreign markets failed to deliver a comparable performance last quarter. In fact, Niu largely attributed the contraction in its gross margin from 20.9% in the year-ago quarter to 20% in the recently completed quarter to weaker international sales. It reported that the number of e-scooters sold in international markets was 11.2% lower than a year ago.

## Now what

Niu Technologies failed to meet expectations last quarter, but management seems hopeful about the future. In the press release accompanying the earnings report, CEO Yan Li said, ""The widened product portfolio and channel coverage also laid a strong foundation for our growth in Q4 and 2022."" Investors, however, should be circumspect about this [growth stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/) and wait to see how the company does in the coming quarters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r07zb8/why_shares_of_niu_technologies_are_crashing_today/

1,"11/23/2021, 14:04:15",SNAP Analysis- 23 Nov 2021,AudaciousCalls,"Hello, fellow apes just thought I'd share some DD with you and would love your input and discussions. Now all of you have probably heard of Snapchat, the app your girlfriend uses when she is talking to her boyfriend. I've decided to look into the stock after the plunge it took recently. Allow me to break it down.

Bullish Assumptions:

Using [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) I was able to find some useful info. Out of all institutions holding 449/860 increased positions, 302/860 decreased positions, and 109/860 held positions. 62 funds closed positions entirely while 158 funds entered into new positions. Overall, there are many more shares being bought and held than shares being sold.

Revenue has been steadily growing YoY and EPS (albeit negative) are moving towards positive territory. Keep in mind also that SNAP spends almost its entire revenues on research and development due to the fact that the company is still very young. 

SNAP also has a unique and unparalleled ability to attract younger users, but here is the catch. They retain these users much better than other social media platforms. Many of the younger users also are using snap primarily as a form of texting, not just sending selfies back and forth. The app is honestly more flexible than most analysts give credit for. SNAP could also benefit from the metaverse thesis and their R&amp;D expenses may be indicative that they are already on it.

Bearish Cases:

Although SNAP is growing as a company the social media space is more competitive than ever, especially with the metaverse hype. Other competitors could potentially pull market share away from SNAP and onto their own platform. Additionally, social media is relatively new and like previous platforms, we can not predict with reasonable accuracy that a disruptive technology renders our current useless. 

Negative Earnings: A double-edged sword. As stated previously SNAP has a negative EPS and therefore implies that the stock is much higher risk compared to a positive EPS low PE company. (respectively, you aren't on this thread looking for low-risk slow-growing assets though)

Conclusion:

Based on the current price level and company performance I don't see why SNAP wouldn't rebound. The company is highly innovative, retains users well, and is flexible. Financials are improving and it appears that management has good control over financial metrics. For transparency's sake, I am holding 240 shares @ 51.09 AVG, 3 Jan 20, 2023, $50 Strike Calls, and 2 Jan 20, 2023, $60 Strike calls. I  know this isn't a massive position but I believe in entering slowly and will be accumulating over the next 5 months. I believe given the right market environment this stock could reasonably be at $65/share by the end of next year. Also, this is not financial advice and I always advocate investing according to your own goals.

Without question it goes to say that Playboy looks like a shitty company. But in Q3 2021 on thier investor relations page they said that they had a 67% YOY growth rate for sales. They also talk about their 3 strategies :   ""expanding our U.S. direct-to-consumer commerce business, optimizing our licensing partnerships in key territories and categories, and driving new recurring revenue growth initiatives with a focus on innovative digital offerings such as our soon-to-launch creator-led platform, CENTERFOLD, and our NFT Rabbitars, which we plan to develop into a membership experience. Yes thats right they are now in the NFT business. As disappointing as their covid revanue loss may sound their DTC revanue actually increased 140% and their licensing revanue increased 14%. They seem to be adequately liquid with a current ratio of 1.44 . They sell products in over 180 countries and are the 17th most liecnces brand in the world. They had also recently aquired Honey Birdette which seems to be having insane organic growth. GenZ kids in America alone spend $100M on playboy. Do yall not see this.

I never sell, I only average down...I had multiple opportunities to sell in the green but feel I have stumbled into what decentralised currencies used to be 10 years ago. 

I have been in this stock $WATT for what it feels like forever. Every time the company has good news it gets clobbered. First by Citron when it tanked from 32 dollars to 19. Then by other short sellers who brought it down to 60 cents. And now by funds such as Blackrock. The company hasn't done itself any favours by missing deadlines and shifting focus multiple times. But now they can harvest energy from radio waves and have unlimited distance approval for harvesting up to 5.5W in the US and EU. First clients have ordered chips to do intelligent warehouses / networks where these pixels / tags can deliver intelligent data that can be monetized.

510c's will be delta hedged at about 0.01 tomorrow. So for the low price of less than $22 per contract, you can make the MM have to delta hedge one shiny share of GME! If the price ran to just $280, those same 510c's have a delta of 0.078 (7ish shares of GME). Based on the liquidity we saw two weeks ago of 75k long volume per $5. We can conclude that for every 10k OI at 510c will move the price upwards an additional $5 if the price reaches $280.

This is most assuredly a retarded degenerate play that would make even the most hardened WSB 0DTE CLOV call humper cry tears of envy. Be prepared to light your money on fire.

My thesis stems from the current state of the restaurant industry.  What was a cutthroat, ultra-competitive, slim margin business before COVID-19, is now facing even tougher conditions.  And most of their business is now takeaway and delivery.

The company fulfills online ordering for Shake Shack, Cheesecake Factory &amp; over 400 other brands in 75,000 locations.  These restaurant brands are able to break fee from the fees and inefficiencies of 3rd parties like Doordash, Grubhub, etc.

1,"11/23/2021, 11:17:29","Forget TDOC, HIMS will dominate Telehealth",Miladyboi,"Lets get straight to the point, HIMS is an overlooked GEM that has been ignored by the market after its hot IPO and subsequent fall. Lets start off with the basic financial rundown, HIMS will do 263-265 million dollars in revenue meaning that theyre trading at a P/S of about 5.2, much lower than TDOCs 8.5 not to mention that HIMS is just a 1.4 billion dollar company while TDOC is over 17.4 billion, now, this alone does not justify a higher multiple but wait till I get to the growth.

HIMS has grown revenue 64% YoY with an INSANE gross margin of 76% which grew another 3% YoY. Once again, lets compare it to TDOC who is their closest competitor in this space although it is important to note that TDOC is B-B while HIMS is B-C. TDOCs gross margin was 67.3% therefore once again justifying a higher multiple for HIMS.

Additionally, one large concern people have regarding this sector is the extreme competition but first, its important to note that TDOC and HIMS are in different spaces with HIMS targeting the consumer and TDOC targeting other businesses, one thing HIMS said one of their recent reports was:

 While Hims &amp; Hers does not believe there are currently any direct competitors that offer the full suite of solutions and direct-to-consumer touch points as it does, there are several companies that offer components of telehealth or address chronic conditions that compete with Hims &amp; Hers solutions.



In direct-to-consumer healthcare, Hims &amp; Hers competition is largely fragmented and consists of many competitors that are smaller in scale and/or are more niche in focus with respect to the conditions they treat. Within parts of the sexual health and hair loss market, Hims &amp; Hers also competes mostly with private organizations with similar product offerings for consumers.



In telehealth and chronic disease management, Hims &amp; Hers competes with other providers that are larger in scale and generally provide telehealth on behalf of self-insured employers and insurance plans.

Another thing I havent mentioned yet is their actual profit and FCF which at first sight may seem unfortunate that they are not positive but the company has intentionally done this to ensure that they can grow as fast as possible in this industry.

Quick Note, the TAM is 121 billion dollars, thats insane.

Another very nice aspect of this company is that they have over 252 million dollars in cash which is continuing to grow at an extremely fast rate YoY. I absolutely love this aspect of the company as well because for such as small company having such a large cash supply, in ensures they wont issue more shares and it helps with any additional acquisitions to fuel their growth.

Now, you must be thinking that this cant get much better, but it does, part of their business model is SUBSCRIPTION BASED, and if you ask me, any subscription based business model is pretty sexy, this is what they said about it:

 Subscriptions grew 95% to approximately 551,000 as of September 30, 2021 as compared to approximately 283,000 subscriptions as of September 30, 2020. Growth in Subscriptions was driven by increased customer conversion rates from improved onsite and customer onboarding experiences, increased customer engagement with our marketing campaigns, increased retention rates of existing subscribers (also referred to as members), increased marketing expenses, and the addition of Subscriptions from the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL. As a result of growth in Subscriptions, we generated approximately 968,000 Net Orders, an increase of 66% as compared to approximately 582,000 Net Orders for the three months ended September 30, 2020. We generated approximately 2.4 million Net Orders, an increase of 44% as compared to approximately 1.7 million Net Orders for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Lastly, lets talk a bit more about their future and some activity around the stock. So, they are projected to grow over 42% next year but I think they will exceed those expectations due to their nature of under promising and over delivering.

Finally, the stock has been absolutely ravaged this year and over the past few weeks, options are absolutely dirt cheap as the IV is so low and people dont have high expectations. My price target is personally $14 by the end of 2022 but reach your own expectations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r03j1x/forget_tdoc_hims_will_dominate_telehealth/

Short $RIVN.  Ford pulled out today and that may just be foreshadowing.  The irrational valuations for EVs cannot be overstated.  As one commentator on CNBC pointed out the other day, if ever new car bought was a Tesla, they'd still be overvalued.

$RIVN, is the hot new thing.  They've gone public and seen the stock top out at $179.47 for a company that has produced a grand total of 150 vehicles.  They still have backing from Amazon but I don't think that means shit without Bezos running the place.  Maybe with Bezos still in the C suite there might be some appetite to try and stab Tesla and Musk in the heart by capitalizing a competitor but I think Amazon cuts and runs if this think starts to stink.

It is going to start to stink over the next few weeks because Elon has proven one thing definitively: starting and scaling a true EV company is really really hard.  At some point reality is simply going to catch up.

What say you?  Am I too optimistic that the EV bubble is going to pop soon?  I'd love to hear the counters.  I give $RIVN credit, the truck is good looking.

While not surprising, I don't think it really warrants what we've been seeing. 

Cashflows are great, strong balance sheet, outlook is good. To me, everyone is overreacting to what's been going on with ATT/IDFA changes. The reality is that ATT is leveling the playing field when it comes to mobile advertising -- every player in the mobile ecosystem is dealing with it. Even more important -- the overwhelming majority of their revenue is coming from IAPs (in-app purchases). So, provided they can continue to acquire new users, it's hard for me to see what the risks are.

1,"11/23/2021, 10:10:51",What do you believe are the best option trading strategies to utilize for GME?,StrongBodyStrongMind," So the eventual MOASS is confirmed. The DD has been done. Today, GME closed at a price not seen since the first week of June 2021.

I have been day and swing trading GME calls and made some incredible profits since January 2021.

(Got embroiled in this entire debacle in November of 2020 by buying up 400 shares @ $17 a share; sold many on the surge up to $498, held through the short campaigns that took it down to $38 and then back up to $350 and down and up and down and now up to $248.85.)

**Here are my current long GME call positions:**

12/17/21 $250c x 10

12/17/21 $300c x 10

1/21/22 $250c x 10

1/21/22 $300c x 5

2/17/22 $250c x 5

I am satisfied with the 40-60% unrealized profits on these positions after only having held them since last Wednesday and fully expect GME to touch $300 by end of November.

I will be selling 80% of these contracts before close of market on this Wednesday afternoon. I have limit sells set at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% profit as well as a few that I'll hang onto just incase some crazy price action occurs and we see GME shoot above $420.69.

But I feel like there are BETTER strategies with a higher probability of being ITM / profitable, or with less downside risk.

**The only other strategies I have experience executing (buying / selling to open and to close) besides buying long calls are:**

1. Selling cash-secured puts 30-45 DTE
2. Buying a &gt;70 delta call atleast 180 DTE and selling &lt;30 delta weekly calls

**My succinct and basic predictions concerning the GME debacle:**

If MOASS occurs, IV% will spike to &gt;500%.

If MOASS occurs, we could see the price of the underlying jump 100% in one single market session.

In the lead up to MOASS, we will see repeated bouts of ATHs being set followed by sharp sell-offs but a general trend of higher lows and higher highs.

So here is my question to the experienced and successful option traders here:What are some other, perhaps more obscure / esoteric strategies that would work very well with the current situation that GME underlying stock finds itself?

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Following President Joe Biden's choice of Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve for a second term, equities lost ground while Treasury yields soared. The dollar increased in value.
* The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 40 points in the final 45 minutes of trade in the United States. The index had spent the whole session higher before a sell-off in technology stocks drove it down for the day.
* The NASDAQ 100 dropped more than 1%, with Peloton and Docusign both falling at least 5.5%.
* The swaps market in the United States is now pricing in a full 25 basis point rate hike for the June Fed meeting, with a second increase expected in November. The dollar rose, while gold fell by more than 2% and oil rose.
* Biden had been considering between Powell and Brainard who he nominated for the position of vice-chair. The Powell selection comes amid rising concern that the United States' central bank would fall behind the curve in tackling sticky inflation.
* Consumer-price rise is accelerating at the strongest rate in decades, and price-growth forecasts are at their greatest since 2013.

1 Billion has already increased the price of Uranium by 50%. Imagine what another 2.5 billion will do. Their ticker \[REDACTED\] is currently trading well below NAV which means it is already at a discount. If we take a look at previous NAV charts we can see that after dipping below NAV, \[REDACTED\] immediately shoots back up (taking other Uranium equities with it, ie. CCJ and others). We can see that CCJ (and other Uranium equities have had profits taken recently, however it is keeping the mid-term bullish trend going. This is a CHEAP buying imo. 

I am anticipating a +10 percent day tomorrow off this news, but I am possibly delusional. Full disclosure I am in 28c 11/26 and 30c 12/9. Inflation, Sprott, new global demand, it's all there. 

All it takes is a small catalyst to send Uranium to new highs. Last month it was China's global demand, before that it was Sprott's 1\~ Bill ATM. I'd say an additional 2\~ Bill would be enough to send CCJ to the moon.

If all of this was not enough. Let's take a look at CCJ's option chain. JUST for the 12/17 exp date there is almost 1 million options expiring.

1,"11/23/2021, 09:40:45",Institutions dont want you to know about these companies,park9720,"Theres an industry in the US that is  currently booming, seeing record revenue growth YoY with massive growth  predicted in the near term and future. That industry is US Cannabis.  When I say US Cannabis Im talking about Trulieve, Cresco Labs, Curaleaf  and Green Thumb. Most of you dumb fucks comment TILRAY and  SUNDIAL on every post pertaining to US Cannabis but have absolutely  no idea that there are currently massive companies already dominating  the US markets; these companies are undervalued, operate in a market  that is CURRENTLY 3x LARGER than the Canadian market and major  institutions are sitting on the sidelines.

Since  MSO's are not allowed to trade on major exchanges like the Nasdaq and  the NYSE and technically run federally illegal businesses, most  institutional investors will not touch them. In fact, retail investors  currently account for about 95% of MSO's free float. Once Legalization  takes place or the Safe Banking Act goes through and MSO's can uplist  from the OTC and CSE, institutions will be loading up on these American  based Cannabis behemoths- but until then retail investors have a  significant opportunity.

I know  75% of you had your assholes clenched since the second you read the word  cannabis, but there is a significant difference between the Canadian  Cannabis companies (LP's) youre currently holding the bag on, and US cannabis companies (MSO'S). Im going to quickly compare the numbers and show you why youre buying in low on the US based cannabis companies.

US Market Currently 18 Recreational States and 36 Medical States- Total Population 110M 

Recreational States coming in 2022- [New York](https://www.nytimes.com/article/new-york-marijuana-legalization-facts.html), [Ohio](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/republican-ohio-lawmaker-announces-marijuana-legalization-bill-reflecting-recent-bipartisan-shift-on-issue/) &amp; [Pennsylvania](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/philadelphia-voters-approve-marijuana-referendum-calling-for-statewide-legalization/)\- Total Pop 44M

Canadian Market Entire Country is recreational- Total Pop 37.5M

As  it stands right now the US market is 3x larger than the Canadian  market, when the 3 states listed above go online it will be 4x larger. A  lot of you probably had no idea the legal market was so big in the US,  and if youre wondering if it directly correlates to higher sales- youd  be correct.

[Revenues Most Recent Q](https://preview.redd.it/zg76bpxk19181.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e1f2d0a99c313b5f7216e3a39655bd2a0a380da)

Not only do the US based companies  have significantly better Revenues and EBITDA, Trulieve and Green Thumb  are profitable (40M &amp; 22M), with Curaleaf (-7M) and Cresco (-4M) on  the cusp of profitability.

US  Cannabis companies are clearly better built and operate in a market that  is literally 4x larger than their Canadian peers but for some reason  trade at half the multiple of the Canadian companies. There is no media  hype around these companies, they are some of the heaviest [shorted](https://shortdata.ca/largest-short-positions) companies on the CSE, Morgan Stanley even recently [banned](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-jpmorgan-restrict-trading-us-cannabis-stocks-letter-2021-11-02/)  the buying of MSO's. These companies are hidden gems that institutions  dont want you to know about so they can get in on the low, but it is an  incredible opportunity for retail investors.

During  the cannabis bull run Canadian companies were valued as high as 36-427x  their current revenues. None of the US companies Ive listed are  currently valued above 6x revenue.

1,"11/23/2021, 09:39:04",$DWAC: Most obvious short,ishiboy,"Truth Social or $DWAC is the most obvious short. 

**Valuation** 

Many have used the \~145M follower count of his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram followers combined to reach the high number that they have. But any rational person understands that following someone on social media does not mean you will create an account and use a social media site just because of them. Also the same person, might follow him on multiple sites. Plus, a lot of his followers are Russian bots. 

Trump tried creating a blog website previously and it was shut down after 1 month because no one visited it or shared it. Other similar attempts for conservative / anti ""woke"" platforms have only been able to get to 2.3 million (Parler) mau.

According to the data, on Oct. 25, Parler was downloaded about 16,000 times. Downloads peaked in mid-November, when it was downloaded nearly 340,000 times in a single day. On Monday, it was downloaded nearly 20,000 times. Daily active users on Parler shot up from about 500,000 on Oct. 25 to a peak of about 2.9 million in late November and have since fallen to 2.3 million.

Let's just say best case DWAC or Trump Media group can get to 10 million active users. 

Here are the ARPU's for the major social media portals:

Facebook - $30.75

Twitter - $9.39

Snap - $1.73

Pinterest - $3.69

The feature set is very similar to Twitter. So based on Twitter's revenue per user and 10 million users. Lets just say they can make $90 million a year in revenue. (Unlikely, but best case). 

Here are the market cap numbers per active user for all the social media platforms:

Twitter: $81/user

Facebook: $151/user

Pinterest: $157/user

Snap: $181/user 

At a Twitter like valuation, assuming DWAC/Truth Social can get to the following users here is the corresponding market cap:

5 million MAU - $400million

10 million MAU - $800 million

20 milion MAU - $1.6 billion 

At the current price, the SPAC shareholders will be left with an estimated $1.5 billion interest in the combined company. Investors in 15 million warrants tied to the SPAC will be sitting on another $300 million. 

Trumps company will receive a 86 million shares as part of the deal, worth $3.9 billion. And, assuming shares consistently stay above $30 over the course of about a month and a half after the merger, the owners of Trumps group will receive an additional 40 million shares, worth $1.6 billion at todays prices. In total, that all adds up to $7.3 billion.

At a 10 million MAU the Company is overvalued by 10x at a 20 million MAU the Company is overvalued by 5x. 

**Dilution**  

The Company most likely will have to raise a PIPE to fund the launch of the network or social media platform because it only has $275 million in the bank. This PIPE will most likely be priced at $10 or $15 which will significantly dilute the SPAC shareholders and create downward pressure on the stock.

**Current Progress** 

Hackers gained access to a privateversion of former President Donald Trumps recently announced [social media platform](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/21/truth-social-platform-goes-viral-social-media/6115565001/)and posted images of defecating pigs, expletives and more, [according to](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/technology/trump-truth-social-hackers.html) [multiple reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/trump-truth-social-fake-accounts/)

The hackers, affiliated with the hacking collective Anonymous, [told The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/technology/trump-truth-social-hackers.html) that the move was part of their online war against hate. 

Using a false account dubbed donaldjtrump, the hackers posted the photos of the pigs, wrote profane rants againstTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey andmade a fakeaccountfor former Trump adviser SteveBannon, according to multiple reports. The hackers also posted memes from fake accounts for Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence and others. 

The initial beta was supposed to be launched in November but was delayed. The issue might be that it won't abide by the terms laid out by the people who wrote its source code. Mastodon, the open-source platform that TRUTH Social is using. Mastodon says it sent a formal letter on Oct. 26 to TRUTH Social's chief legal officer requesting compliance.

For a entire social media site, they have zero job openings. An email sent to the career email on the website seems to be unmanaged. 

Finally, on November 18th  Sen. Elizabeth Warren asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate a planned SPAC deal involving the new social media company of former President Donald Trump.Warren noted recent news reports that Digital World Acquisition Corp may have committed securities violations by holding private and undisclosed discussions about the merger as early as May 2021.

I'm looking at your posts for quite a long time now, and I never really participated in the joint effort. I think now it is time for me to bring my contribution to you and I am sure you won't regret it. 

I found an amazing coin which is Casper Network. The first time I discovered it, I thought it was another shitcoin but after checking a bit, I understood that it is much more, something more similar to FTM or DOT, with the same potential or more (only 400M Marketcap for now). Casper network is a proof-of-stake blockchain oriented towards professionals. Many large companies such as Adobe or Avalara are already using it because it is very well done, user-friendly, and the fees are very low compared with other blockchains. For example, some companies migrated their patent databases onto Casper and used Casper a few days ago as founding capital for incorporation... This blockchain is useful...

Ok, now you know a bit more about Casper and why it will probably have an important place in the defi environment. But why should you get in right now? Because technically it's really a fucking good time to invest in Casper Network. The chart is still quite horizontal, we just got a reverse shoulder head shoulder short term and a middle term cup, which is very bull. If you check the history of Casper, it is coming from far and we are at the bottom. Everything makes me think it will pump and go to the moon. I just made all in...

Also have a look at the CEO: https://imgur.com/yhFa202
For sure you will want to make all in with me after that... this coin will give you more pleasure than your girlfriend.

[www.radiogel.com](https://www.radiogel.com/)  
Outstanding shares: 336,696,350  
Current offering for 50M shares for "" **the Company believes it will cost approximately $9 million to: (1) fund the FDA approval process to conduct human clinical trials, (2) conduct Phase I, pilot, clinical trials, (3) activate several regional clinics to administer IsoPet across the county, (4) create an independent production center within the current production site to create a template for future international manufacturing, and (5) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of the United States.** ""

Radiogel is a solid tumor/cancer treatment that injects yttrium-90 phosphate particles via small needle inside a tumor and is held in place by hydrogel. They have proven it's effectiveness many times and it doesn't leak from the hydrogel. This treatment gives 400gy of radiation to a tumor from within and the short range particles don't effect surrounding organs and tissues. If you were to use a radiation beam machine it gives roughly 50gy of radiation and effects all your tissues and anything that is in-between it and the tumor they're targeting. They use this same product for animals (Isopet) and have been actively treating dogs, cats and now horses.

They are currently working with the FDA in the EFS program to work towards receiving a IDE to start human trials. They are going to do non-resectable cancerous lymph nodes as the current treatments used for this only knocks down the cancer a little, but comes right back. Another big reason why they are doing this is because they can see results within 15-30 days unlike other cancers that may take years to see results. So if there's positive results they can get approved very fast compared to other clinical trails.

The CEO has mentioned that he'd like to see Radiogel be used in children's hospitals for stuff like brain tumors. Chemo attacks growing tissues and kids are nothing but growing tissues.  
Once they get the FDA clearance to start human trials they are going to take this internationally and already have contracts written up ready to go with other countries who have been waiting to see them be further into the FDA process.

The half life of the y90 is 2.7 days so you are receiving most of the radiation quickly yet having little to no side effects. You are legit giving super high doses of radiation to the tumor from within the tumor itself. I have personally confirmed with the company that they can use this treatment along with other treatments such as chemo for more advance cases. Most treatments that are like this use metal or glass beads that have some sort of radioactive particles, however, in most cases you have to surgically remove the beads afterwards and can cause more issues. This hydrogel is naturally absorbed by the tissue and is disposed of in natural processes. Their product and processes are all patent protected even in China.

Oh I didn't mention they are working with the Mayo Clinic and will most likely be using the Mayo Clinic Protocol for human trials. Mayo Clinic has been rated #1 hospital for like 7 years now or something like that and Vivos ($RDGL) has been working with 3 Mayo Clinic doctors for the past 4-5 years. They helped work with the medical advisory board (MAB) to come up with a list of 18 different cancers that this product will work and possibly be the best treatment for.

1,"11/23/2021, 08:07:52",Institutions dont want you to know about these stocks,park9720,"Theres an industry in the US that is currently booming, seeing record revenue growth YoY with massive growth predicted in the near term and future. That industry is US Cannabis. When I say US Cannabis Im talking about Trulieve, Cresco Labs, Curaleaf and Green Thumb. Most of you dumb fucks comment TILRAY and SUNDIAL on every post pertaining to US Cannabis but have absolutely no idea that there are currently massive companies already dominating the US markets; these companies are undervalued, operate in a market that is CURRENTLY 3x LARGER than the Canadian market and major institutions are sitting on the sidelines.

Since MSOs are not allowed to trade on major exchanges like the Nasdaq and the NYSE and technically run federally illegal businesses, most institutional investors will not touch them. In fact, retail investors currently account for about 95% of MSOs free float. Once Legalization takes place or the Safe Banking Act goes through and MSOs can uplist from the OTC and CSE, institutions will be loading up on these American based Cannabis behemoths- but until then retail investors have a significant opportunity.

I know 75% of you had your assholes clenched since the second you read the word cannabis, but there is a significant difference between the Canadian Cannabis companies (LPs) youre currently holding the bag on, and US cannabis companies (MSOS). Im going to quickly compare the numbers and show you why youre buying in low on the US based cannabis companies.

US Market Currently 18 Recreational States and 36 Medical States- Total Population 110M

Recreational States coming in 2022- [New York](https://www.nytimes.com/article/new-york-marijuana-legalization-facts.html), [Ohio](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/republican-ohio-lawmaker-announces-marijuana-legalization-bill-reflecting-recent-bipartisan-shift-on-issue/) &amp; [Pennsylvania](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/philadelphia-voters-approve-marijuana-referendum-calling-for-statewide-legalization/)\- Total Pop 44M

Canadian Market Entire Country is recreational- Total Pop 37.5M

As it stands right now the US market is 3x larger than the Canadian market, when the 3 states listed above go online it will be 4x larger. A lot of you probably had no idea the legal market was so big in the US, and if youre wondering if it directly correlates to higher sales- youd be correct.

[Revenue Multiple Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/9etq9dsph8181.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89da1cc05fe26fdc49cc3eea800ec110a7c00af8)

Not only do the US based companies have significantly better Revenues and EBITDA, Trulieve and Green Thumb are profitable (40M &amp; 22M), with Curaleaf (-7M) and Cresco (-4M) on the cusp of profitability.

US Cannabis companies are clearly better built and operate in a market that is literally 4x larger than their Canadian peers but for some reason trade at half the multiple of the Canadian companies. There is no media hype around these companies, they are some of the heaviest [shorted](https://shortdata.ca/largest-short-positions) companies on the CSE, Morgan Stanley even recently [banned](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-jpmorgan-restrict-trading-us-cannabis-stocks-letter-2021-11-02/) the buying of MSOs. These companies are hidden gems that institutions dont want you to know about so they can get in on the low, but it is an incredible opportunity for retail investors.

During the cannabis bull run Canadian companies were valued as high as 36-427x their current revenues. None of the US companies Ive listed are currently valued above 6x revenue. Let that sink in.

AUR is my big question for the time beeing. It was released on May 14 2021, and was slept upon until about last week where it saw a growth of 51% basically over night. There were some projections posted about the stock on here about a week ago, where the stock was expected to reach around 25-30$. I resently baught around midway rise, and didnt sell out when it hit its peak of 17.11$, probably cause i am a gready shit whom doesnt know when to call it. Do you all have any thoughts about the stock? is it just higly slept upon, or is the stock now ""finished"".   


In short: 

Nothing has happened to the stock for about 6 months and suddenly it increaed with 51%, but has now started to decrease in value.

Hey guys I was doing some research and come upon some insider buying of extreme magnitude. The GOEV stock has been going up recently but today was extremely surprising as the current CBO/CEO Aquila Tony has increased his stake in the company by a whopping for 254 percent and the director of the company increased his stake by 105 percent. Now you have to realize that insiders might sell their shares for any reason(Tax reasons, locking in profits, shareholder lockups, etc), but when insiders buy their shares it usually only ,earns one thing which is that the insiders think that the price will go up. 

So I ask you guys that with the recent increase in GOEV stock price and the fact that insiders are increasing their stake at unprecedented magnitude, could we take this moment as an extremely bullish sign for the stock?

SDC  calls that I lost 30K on instantly because i made a market order.  They  were only worth 1K at the time of purchase. I thought okay i messed  up  obviously expensive lesson, but what is not making sense is that the   time stamp says 9:40 am ET which would mean i made that trade at 6:30   am PT (My time) which i never did. I made this trade between 930am PT   and 1130am PT. I called to confirm there isnt a glitch with the time   stamp and they're telling me that yes indeed i did make that trade at   630 am PT. Which is literally the time I wake up to my alarm and press   snooze.. So they're saying if i can prove otherwise they will   investigate the issue.. Just wondering what options I have to look into.   I have my phone use history for RBC app but not sure that's good   enough.

Every other company has been building the same vehicle over and over again, Tesla had the bright idea to add batteries but changed nothing else except adding a frunk. EV's offer the opportunity to rethink this design, however Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Fisker, Lordstown, you name it, have opted to manufacture the same damn thing.

Canoo has rethought this formula, and is creating vehicles with more space and less of a footprint. Want a minivan interior with a compact car exterior? Want a truck with a longer bed and more storage space than an F250 in half the footprint? Only Canoo is offering these things, and my bet is that the age of supersized unnecessary vehicles is closing, and the age of efficiency and proper utilization of space is near.

I've been in this company since pre-SPAC and it continues to quietly and thoughtfully move forward. It's signed a deal with one contract manufacturer in Europe (VDL NEDCAR) and has signed an agreement with Oklahoma to build its own facility. Canoo just bumped up it's manufacturing timeline to late 2022 and, just for fun, Apple was in negotiations with this company early on, and if you believe the rumors, they offered to buy it and they were rejected by the leadership team.

And just to be as honest as possible, I've owned both the stock and warrants for the last 18 months and it currently takes up about 33% of my brokerage account (it was 8 percent not that long ago but it's gone up and I couldn't help but buy more).

I am still learning what it means to short sell and all that. This is a nutty world y'all play in... So I don't really understand how to interpret an increase in short-selling when a company is having problems, but the company also is mostly fundamentally sound. Like, I get that shorting is a bet that the company will do worse, but some shorting seems to be piling on and driving a price down more than justifiable.

For example, Purple. The mattress company has really suffered from supply chain issues (as have every one of their competitors). They may have been overvalued too. But since their high point early in 2021 they have dropped like 75%. That seems way too much. Perhaps it is a normal penalizing and they'll slowly climb back, but there also seems to be an increase in [shorts](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/prpl/short-interest).

I dont even want to say how long ive been at this dumbass company but ever since covid has hit, not a day goes by where we dont have lines to the back of the store. I personally dont understand it, but after looking at Krogers past earnings, Im very bullish on their upcoming earnings on December 3rd. Not only that but I speak with my department manager about the numbers we do weekly and again, its just hard to believe. Kroger has made many, many budget cuts in the past 6 months, along with government money from covid shots, and all the others reasons listed, I have high hopes.

1,"11/23/2021, 05:04:25",question about stock option risk (absolute worst case scenarios),EVN23,"So I'm ridiculously new at this...

Long story short: for a while now I've been eyeing some stocks and made some half-assed predictions of whether or not a stock will fall, which just so happened to to become reality.
Sufficed to say that after doing some math, the pickle tickle happened and I've started to take this more seriously.
Right now I'm in the process of doing research on the financial domain itself, what are stocks, what are stock options, how to donate a shitload of money to wallstreet, how NOT to ... etc etc.

During this process, I've come across wsb and some yt videos that showcased wins and losses, and on both sides of the spectrum, some insane shit.

**tldr ... origin story ... who cares... getting to the point:**

Say I decide to invest 1000$ in a call option.

Based on what I've learnt so far, it's possible to turn a 1000$ account into a -2,500,000$ account basically overnight by royally fucking up.

**The question is how... ? **

My reasoning is this:

Whenever you buy some option, regardless of put or call, you essentially ""reserve"" 100 units of whatever financial tool you're using. ... at the strike price.

IF that stock rises above the strike price ... tendies. ok... got it. the more it's over your strike price... the more spendola you get.

HOWEVER ... if it's below the strike price and you fuck up, then you're obligated to buy 100 of whatever stock you picked ... right?

Meaning that if you place a call contract (worth 1000$) on some stock valued at 10,000$/share and fuck up, you're going to have to buy 100* 10,000 =&gt; 1,000,000.00$ money that you don't have. ... and also start picking buildings to jump off of.

... at this point i'm lost completely because seeing as though alpha, beta, theta, rho and the other greek (i'm new at this) are a thing... then you should essentially only, at max, lose the amoutn of money you put towards buying the call option contract. ... meaning a max net loss of 1000$ (or whatever that contract was worth initially)

I'm sure this is not correct/complete. 
Can someone clarify?

1,"11/23/2021, 04:35:12","What I learned losing $6,500 trading in 2021",huginnquill,"  

here is a little self-reflection after losing 6,5K (just under 20% of my savings) in 2021 \[in one of the most bullish years in markets history\].

Why did I start trading in the first place: Seeing my friends and colleagues sharing their ridiculous earnings and success stories from trading and I felt I am missing out so I yolo my savings into about 20-30 stocks.

How did I do it: I spent a ridiculous amount reading 10Ks, analysts reports, listening to earning calls, following trends, and asking those friends who were supposedly making a lot of money trading and followed their steps.

What I learned losing my money? 

1. I am not good at this: needless to say, but I am terrible at trading or investing, and do not have the principles and the right temperament that are needed for being successful.

2. The space is filled with enthusiasm and people dont share their losses. Creating a false sense of everyones winning and that youre missing out. This is especially true if you are following twitter finance.

3. A few bad picks can really ruin your portfolio performance. My ratio of good picks vs bad was about 3:1 but the bad ones I picked I lost significantly more than I gained on the good ones.

4. Anxiety: the anxiety that this caused me was not worth it even if I had managed doubling my money and ended up in green today. Even at times when I was in green or made a large gain on a single stock, I was so overly excited that kept checking my gains, couldnt get a good night sleep and would automatically wake up early around 5am to check premarket prices. In two instances I vomit because I lost 50% on a stock right after earnings call. 

5. Success is often measure by alpha and having a 10% alpha is considered amazing. The $ value of beating the market by 10 is not a good ROI of my time given my portfolio size.

What will I do next: I am considering an automated investing approach currently looking at Charles schwab automated investing in index funds and etfs. And set a biweekly amount to be added to my investment portfolio.

Feel free to share your comments, your experience, advice, and or even a good roast. 2021 has been a wild ride and although I am not happy I lost 6.5K I am grateful it happened early in my life and served me a valuable lesson.

Best of luck to all of you out there,",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzv3wm/what_i_learned_losing_6500_trading_in_2021/

One meal of this death cuisine can hit you like a recovery alcoholic given a Long Island Ice Tea.

In my Interstate travels, I have found that a Tea beverage brand, PureLeaf I think, has added an unsweetened option.  There was virtually no unsweetened option in 30-100 foot glass coolers before this.

Invariably all summer long:  5 rows of fully stocked sweetened and extra sweetened PureLeaf options, one empty unsweetened row.

Travelers were empty oh whole rows if they could find any stocked.

There are no real options for people who no longer eat death cuisine.

1,"11/23/2021, 04:10:27",$GOEV - How Apple Car and EV incentives could make this Oklahoma EV maker a winner in your portfolio,invest_opinions," 

$GOEV - Canoo EV maker has surprised (pleasantly this time) its investors with a much faster go to market date (middle 2022 instead of early 2023 and a smaller loss then expected. Old news anyway as there is a lot more coming for them.

Going long on a stock everybody wants to ask 2 important questions:

What can move $GOEV lower (so I don't loose my money) and obviously - what can make it fly?

Let's start with the first one:

**What can move $GOEV lower?**

Here are couple things that proved painful for investors recently in similar stocks or even for GOEV earlier.

DE**spac shaming - has passed already with many de-spacs performing like in the good old days from 2020.**

**Warrant and PIPE dilution - passed in June.**

**Bonds yields and aversion for risk - passed at least for the time beeing. Bond tapering is in the back mirror and interest rates hike is not yet on the table.**

**Inflation** \- **this will not pass.** It used to be an initial headwind for every EV, AV, innovation stock but my take is this: they've already spend big money to build their business. No with high inflation, every piece of equipment that hey have already bought, every square meter of concrete in their factory, etc. is already more valuable **because of inflation. Their built/invested assets will only increase in value with big inflation in the next years. Any competitor will have to spend a lot more next year or in 2023 to catch up with them, because of inflation. Pretty good moat there!**

No that we are good to go, we can move to catalysts:

**What can move $GOEV Higher**

A number of high impact stories are trending in investor communities. Let's take them one by one:

1. **EV Incentives - Canoo is champion in collecting Federal and State incentives - and now is the best time to get those money**

BBB Bill or Social Spending Bill will provide 8K incentive for every EV bought in US in order to boost EV use to tackle climate change. That ca go up to 12.5K if they'll have 4k union workers. But, **wait, not for every EV - but only for those produced in US.**

**Even GM is making EVs but they make them in Mexico. Canoo has factories in US. Not sure about those union workers (that might also happen) but with in their production in 2022, they'll be fully eligible for 8K incentive for every car made.**

The very first Lifestyle car expected in 2022 will cost some 35K, **BUT** if the BB bill will pass the Senate with EV incentives intact inside, **a Canoo Lifestyle Car will only cost 28K and it will be built in US. Compete with that!**

Even more $GOEV is already in line for **some healthy incentives - 400M** from the factories in Arkansas and Oklahoma.

&gt;**""**In June, we announced Pryor, Oklahoma, as the location for our owned manufacturing facility,"" Aquila said. ""We have expanded this partnership to include Arkansas and additional locations in Oklahoma.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Aquila said that the new deals will bring Canoo about $100 million in incentives, on top of the roughly $300 million it has already received from Oklahoma. **""**(from earnings report).

2. **Apple Car - a story that always reminds of Canoo**

I know, the subject has been up there for years now, but every time APPLE move further or Media is publishing some rumors about it, **APPLE Car is moving the market.**

Short story - Apple is planning for years to create its own car full of gadgets that all IOS users love with one of the most powerful AI on board. Apple is holding tens of Billions and is looking for partners to manufacture this new car.

**What connects Canoo with Apple care?**

**A similar design shared between Canoo and Apple Car** that is user centered, leaves a lot of room to cool displays and is up for grab. Blomberg has some details about that here:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle#:\~:text=be%20designed%20around-,hands%2Doff%20driving.,-One%20option%20discussed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle#:~:text=be%20designed%20around-,hands%2Doff%20driving.,-One%20option%20discussed)

Canoo has never made a secret from the fact that has active partnerships and is looking for new blue chip partners that would us its platform. The hole point in their business concept was to have platform that can be integrated by almost any use, by a variety of tech partners, but with distinct accent on user centered vehicle with AV/AI in mind. (rings any bells? Yes - that is Apple car)

**Why the design looks like has been created by the same mastermind? Because IT WAS!**

Here is the second connection:

**The same mastermind engineer Ulrich Kranz**, co-founder of Canoo and former CEO is now the engineer working to develop Apple Car.

With a back ground in top EV engineering at BMW (i3 and i5) and Faraday Future for a while, Kranz has joined Apple earlier this year. You might say that leaving Canoo for Apple is a bad sign - but Kranz has kept is co-founder status at Canoo and Apple has always confirmed that will work with out sourcing partners to develop the car.

This is only the last records connecting them but the links go much deeper, even from the founding efforts of Canoo.

One of the main investors in Canoo is the Chang family, the same family controlling TPK, the Taiwan based company that provides that nice Apple displays and has done so since Iphone1.

And there is one more story that needs more documentation:

Canoo - WALLMART partnership rumor - well this more of a rumor based on moving its headquarters and the opening of a new manufacturing facility in Bentonville, Arkansas (Home of Wallmart). I wouldn't bet my money on it if I wouldn't have had already for all the other reason to invest in $GOEV.

It would not surprise me if indeed they work on a partnership but until we know more about it... we can only hope.

There is some SI interest there too but that numbers are easy to find for yourself. Obviously not changing the fundamentals but can get the stock a lot more expensive in the next weeks, rewarding for those investors willing to jump in in before those stories unfold. 

So, we're god to go :)

22. Nov (Reuters) - US-Notenbankchef Jerome Powell ist kurz nach der Nominierung durch Prsident Joe Biden fr eine zweite Amtszeit auf die Problematik rasant steigender Preise insbesondere fr Verbraucher eingegangen. ""Wir wissen, dass eine hohe Inflation Familien belastet, besonders diejenigen, die weniger in der Lage sind, die hheren Kosten fr Wesentliches wie Lebensmittel, Unterkunft und Fortbewegung zu stemmen"", sagte Powell am Montag. ""Wir werden unsere Instrumente nutzen, um sowohl die Wirtschaft - einen starken Arbeitsmarkt - zu untersttzen als auch zu verhindern, dass sich eine hhere Inflation festsetzt."" Fed-Direktorin Lael Brainard, die einen Vizeposten bei der Notenbank erhalten soll, betonte, sie werde den Fokus auf die arbeitende Bevlkerung legen. Das bedeute, dass die Inflation gesenkt werden msse.

Die uerungen drften als Signal aufgefasst werden, dass fortan die oberste Prioritt der Fed sein drfte, den rasanten Preisauftrieb unter Kontrolle zu bringen. Die Inflation ist so hoch wie seit drei Jahrzehnten nicht mehr. An den Mrkten wird damit gerechnet, dass unter der Fhrung Powells im Juni 2022 die Zinswende eingeleitet wird.

In addition to all of the above the stock has buy rating from the majority of analysts, and if you compare it to its main competitor $TDOC you will see that $TDOC are making losses quarter after quarter.

This is a hypergrowth stock and setting on very attractive price IMO.

1) INO 4800 - Covid vaccine is in Phase 3 trial in India, China ( Phase 2 as well as booster studies), Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Philippines, and Thailand. US had put a hold on INO Phase 3 back in Sept of 2020 (SMH- No idea why) but has recently lifted the hold... Phase 3 is a case driven trial based on what I heard from the CEO on the earnings call once 75 confirmed covid cases have been reached the study would be unblinded... so the efficacy data might come out sooner than expected... the company does say that they expect efficacy readout to be by or before 2H of 2022. The company plans to apply for EUA in all of the countries where the trial is being conducted... INO could be the go to booster that we seem to need with this disease ...and unfortunately Covid will be endemic ... WHO is also conducting a solidarity trial of INO-4800 (INO was chosen 2 out of out of 20 candidates) in Philippines and Columbia ( at different sites)

2) VGX 3100 - INO recently concluded it's Phase 3 for HPV (HSIL) and met the primary and secondary end points of the study. I think this might be potential product in the market in 2022 (second half)

3) INO 5401 - Phase Trial has been going really well and INO might be kicking this hard to treat cancer's (GBM) ass - This above all is a good reason to be bullish... the data that has been shared thus far looks great... INO has partnered with Regeneron on this one

4) Last check 22% of the float is short ... 

I just wanted to share my thoughts here and make you all aware of this great company that may change the future of medicine in Oncology and Virology... by the way, INO is conducting a phase I trial for Lassa Fever, Phase 2 for MERS, and Phase 1 for Ebola, and Phase 1 for HIV as well...so many irons in the fire...",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzu10f/inovio_pharmaceutical_ino/

What better time to tax loss harvest any losing position and yolo it into a value play like zim or himx. 

Zim is a shipping play while container rates are at all time highs. Inflation has been shown to be a demand issue not supply so even if rates retreat it will only be by a small amount. Zim is also paying a 2.50 dividend in mid dec. Its pe is 3.06, is growing like crazy, and as shipping constraints dominate conversations well into late January this will eventually be the hot sector to invest in.

Himx is a fabless semi play for display driver ics. Its grown over 75% yoy but its sequential growth has been 15+% qoq or sequentially for 5 quarters in a row. Trailing pe is 5.09 and forward is 4.00. Tech growth at value price. The last rotation saw this stock pop from 10.00 to just over 15.

This is not financial advice but just an opportunity for us retail investors to turn the tide before the end of the year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qztity/tax_loss_harvest_and_yolo_zim_or_himx/

Every other company has been building the same vehicle over and over again, Tesla had the bright idea to add batteries but changed nothing else except adding a frunk.  EV's offer the opportunity to rethink this design, however Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Fisker, Lordstown, WKHS, you name it, have opted to manufacture the same damn thing.

Canoo has rethought this formula, and is creating vehicles with more space and less of a footprint.  Want a minivan interior with a compact car exterior?  Want a truck with a longer bed and more storage space than an F250 in half the footprint?  Only Canoo is offering these things, and my bet is that the age of supersized unnecessary vehicles is closing, and the age of efficiency and proper utilization of space is near.

I've been in this company since pre-SPAC and it continues to quietly and thoughtfully move forward.  It's signed a deal with one contract manufacturer in Europe (VDL NEDCAR) and has signed an agreement with Oklahoma to build its own facility.  Canoo just bumped up it's manufacturing timeline to late 2022 and, just for fun, Apple was in negotiations with this company early on, and if you believe the rumors, they offered to buy it and they were rejected by the leadership team.

And just to be as honest as possible, I've owned both the stock and warrants for the last 18 months and it currently takes up about 33% of my brokerage account (it was 8 percent not that long ago but it's gone up and I couldn't help but buy more).  Tesla at 1.2B, Rivian at 100B, Lucid at 90B, Fisker at 6.5B....Canoo at 2.5B.

\- volume: attractive as the average is 9M and the relative vol is 1.5 ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com))

WTF happened,Brb3001,"I recently opened a calendar spread on SPY that had the short leg expire this past Friday and the long leg is expiring today. I initially paid $46 as a debit for this entire trade (0.46 a share) and I was under the impression that this was the max loss that could be sustained from this trade. However I am now seeing an unrealized loss far greater than this. Does anyone know what may have happened as I am confused.

For informational purposes, the trade has gone like this:

\-Originally sold a SPY call at a $469 strike that expired on 11/19 and bought a SPY call at $469 that expires 11/22 (today).

\-The call that I sold was assigned to me at an average price of $467.43 (this is especially weird as how can a call exercise at a price that is under the strike price)

\- At the time of writing, I am currently short 100 SPY due to the assignment and I am still holding the one SPY $469 call that expires later today.

\-My initial debit for this transaction was $46 (which supposedly is your maximum loss) however I am now looking at a unrealized loss that is over 5 times that amount.

Here is a link to see what the trade looks like now: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rol7vv9oKDuaqKofKW7s81vyu23tfXu8/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rol7vv9oKDuaqKofKW7s81vyu23tfXu8/view?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something? Do I need to just wait until the long leg expires or is something wrong? Should I have closed my position before the short leg expired? Am I just plain stupid. Let me know in the comments.

1,"11/23/2021, 01:13:19",$GOEV - How Apple Car and EV incentives could make this Oklahoma EV maker the next $RIVN,invest_opinions,"$GOEV - Canoo inc. has surprised (pleasantly this time)  its investors with a much faster go to market date (middle 2022 instead of early 2023 and a smaller loss then expected. Old news anyway as there is a lot more coming for them. 

Going long I like to ask 2 important questions: 

What can move $GOEV lower (so I don't loose my money) and obviously - what can make it fly? 

Let's start with the first one: 

**What can move $GOEV lower?**

Here are couple things that proved painful for investors recently in similar stocks or even for GOEV earlier.

**SPAC shaming - has passed already with many de-spacs performing like in the good old days from 2020.**

**Warrant and PIPE dilution - passed in June.**

**Bonds yields and aversion for risk - passed at least for the time beeing. Bond tapering is in the back mirror and interest rates hike is not yet on the table.** 

**Inflation** \- **this will not pass.** It used to be an initial headwind for every EV, AV, innovation stock but my take is this: they've already spend big money to build their business. No with high inflation, every piece of equipment that hey have already bought, every square meter of concrete in their factory, etc. is already more valuable **because of inflation. Their built/invested assets will only increase in value with big inflation in the next years. Any competitor will have to spend a lot more next year or in 2023 to catch up with them, because of inflation. Pretty good moat there!**

No that we are good to go, we can move to catalysts: 

**What can move $GOEV Higher**

A number of high impact stories are trending in investor communities. Let's take them one by one:

1. **EV Incentives - Canoo is champion in collecting Federal and State incentives - and now is the best time to get those money**

BBB Bill or Social Spending Bill will provide 12.5K incentive for every EV bought in US in order to boost EV use to tackle climate change. **Wait, not for every EV - but only for those produced in US.**

**Even GM is making EVs but they make them in Mexico. Canoo has factories in US.**

The very first Lifestyle car expected in 2022 will cost some 35K, **BUT** if the BB bill will pass the Senate with EV incentives intact inside, **a Canoo Lifestyle Car will only cost 23K and it will be built in US. Compete with that!**

Even more $GOEV is already in line for **some healthy incentives - 400M** from the factories in Arkansas and Oklahoma.

""In June, we announced Pryor, Oklahoma, as the location for our owned manufacturing facility,"" Aquila said. ""We have expanded this partnership to include Arkansas and additional locations in Oklahoma.""

Aquila said that the new deals will bring Canoo about $100 million in incentives, on top of the roughly $300 million it has already received from Oklahoma. (from earnings report).

2. **Apple Car - a story that always reminds of Canoo**

I know, the subject has been up there for years now, but every time APPLE move further or Media is publishing some rumors about it, **APPLE Car is moving the market.**

Short story - Apple is planning for years to create its own car full of gadgets that all IOS users love with one of the most powerful AI on board. Apple is holding tens of Billions and is looking for partners to manufacture this new car.

**What connects Canoo with Apple care?**

**A similar design shared between Canoo and Apple Car** that is user centered, leaves a lot of room to cool displays and is up for grab. Blomberg has some details about that here:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle#:\~:text=be%20designed%20around-,hands%2Doff%20driving.,-One%20option%20discussed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle#:~:text=be%20designed%20around-,hands%2Doff%20driving.,-One%20option%20discussed)

Canoo has never made a secret from the fact that has active partnerships and is looking for new blue chip partners that would us its platform. The hole point in their business concept was to have platform that can be integrated by almost any use, by a variety of tech partners, but with distinct accent on user centered vehicle with AV/AI in mind. (rings any bells? Yes - that is Apple car)

Why the design looks like has been created by the same mastermind? Because IT WAS!

Here is the second connection:

**The same mastermind engineer Ulrich Kranz**, co-founder of Canoo and former CEO is now the engineer working to develop Apple Car.

With a back ground in top EV engineering at BMW (i3 and i5) and Faraday Future for a while, Kranz has joined Apple earlier this year. You might say that leaving Canoo for Apple is a bad sign - but Kranz has kept is co-founder status at Canoo and Apple has always confirmed that will work with out sourcing partners to develop the car.

This is only the last records connecting them but the links go much deeper, even from the founding efforts of Canoo.

One of the main investors in Canoo is the Chang family, the same family controlling TPK, the Taiwan based company that provides that nice Apple displays and has done so since Iphone1.

And there is one more story that needs more documentation:

**Canoo WALLMART partnership** \- well this more of a rumor based on moving its headquarters and the opening of a new manufacturing facility in Bentonville, Arkansas (Home of Wallmart).

It would not surprise me if indeed they work on a partnership but until we know more about it... we con only hope.

There is some SI interest there too but that numbers are easy to find for yourself.  Obvously not changing the fundamentals but can get the stock a lot more expensive ahead of the unfolding stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, we're god to go :)

SoftBank Vision Fund CFO Cautions Many Recent Investments Are Going to Fail
Mentioned:	DIDI
By Nina Trentmann 

SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund has poured billions of dollars into into startups and later-stage companies. After recovering last year from losses related to the coronavirus pandemic, the fund suffered in recent months after Chinese regulators cracked down on a range of consumer-facing businesses that hurt SoftBank's investments in companies such as ride hailing company Didi Global Inc. The fund -- via its Fund I and Fund II -- holds stakes in about 250 companies. Navneet Govil, the CFO of the Vision Fund, this week invited the finance chiefs of some portfolio companies to California. Edited excerpts follow. 

WSJ: You are hosting a summit for the CFOs of your portfolio companies. Why? 

Mr. Govil: For us, it's very simple. We've invested in these companies. We want them to be successful. There's all kinds of things [CFOs] can talk about: Which general ledger system are you using? What would a roadshow look like? What kind of controls do you need to have in place prior to going public? They can have those types of candid conversations. 

WSJ: Your portfolio companies are going public at a rapid pace, many of them through traditional initial public offerings or via mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies. Indian payments firm Paytm listed this week, with shares falling more than 20% on the first day of trading. Is that a problem? 

Mr. Govil: The stock's down, but we got in much, much earlier, at a lower valuation. We invested in them three or four years ago, so it's OK. The valuations [in the Indian market] are very constructive. 

WSJ: Grab Holdings Inc., the ride-hailing, food-delivery and digital-wallet group, is still working on the $40 billion SPAC-merger it announced this spring after it discovered that certain financial documents were missing. 

Mr. Govil: It's going to be before the end of this calendar year. It's a lot of this [Securities and Exchange Commission] stuff, having to revise the financials, which is all good. A lot of SPAC [combinations] that would have been earlier are happening now or will happen a little later. 

WSJ: Does the SEC's increased scrutiny of warrants have an impact on your investments? 

Mr. Govil: We have three SPACs out there and two have no warrants. We're not here to make money through warrants. We have already committed capital in those SPACs and it's going to be locked up for either a year or two years. We're long term investors. The first fund is 12 to 14 years. Our second fund has 15 years left. If you look at any of our investments in companies that have gone public, we haven't totally exited them. We will let the company go public, you have a lockup period and then we monetize over time. 

WSJ: Does SoftBank have a preference on how its portfolio companies go public? 

Mr. Govil: We don't care whether they want to SPAC, do a direct listing or IPO, whenever the time is ready. 

WSJ: You invested $14 billion in 67 companies in the past quarter. Do you see this pace continuing? 

Mr. Govil: For [Vision] Fund II, our average investment size is $100 million to $200 million. The idea is to come in early, when these companies have a proven business model. They have real revenues, are growing and they're either profitable or they have a path to profitability. We feel this is a comfortable pace, maybe a little up and down. Instead of 67, maybe it's 50 or 70 for a quarter and instead of $14 billion, it's $8 billion to $10 billion. 

WSJ: How convinced are you that these 67 investments will bear fruit? 

Mr. Govil: Not all of these companies are going to be DoorDash Inc.[a food delivery company that surged in value when it went public]. A lot of them are going to fail. That's OK, because it wasn't a multibillion-dollar investment that you've lost. It gives us the opportunity to come in early and [for] the ones that do well, we can then double down. 

WSJ: Valuations are high right now. Do you see the risk of a market correction? 

Mr. Govil: We are long term investors. Yes, we could be in a bubble. There could be significant market corrections. 

WSJ: How about China? Your Chinese investments tanked in the most recent quarter. What does that mean for future investments? 

Mr. Govil: We have to let the regulatory environment settle down. If you look at what has happened recently, whether it is edtech or even Didi, [there is] sensitivity [around] consumer data. So for now, we are staying away from some of those types of companies. 

WSJ: For how long? 

Mr. Govil: It will take some time. We're not talking about decades and we're not talking about months. It's somewhere in between one to two years. 

WSJ: Do you see growing competition for investments in private companies, from Tiger Global and other crossover investors? 

Mr. Govil: It's great to see these others are now coming in. We think it's a validation of our investing thesis. 

WSJ: Does the competition from other investors impact your due diligence? 

Mr. Govil: We have a 400-person organization today. We have our own compliance team, our own legal team, our own financial diligence team, our investing teams. There's absolutely no shortcuts in the process. 

WSJ: You have lost billions of dollars in the past quarter. 

Mr. Govil: When you have a $70 billion public position, there's going to be volatility. Last quarter, we were down by $9 billion. Any quarter, we can be up $5 billion to $10 billion or down $5 billion to $10 billion. On a cumulative basis, we're doing well. We're continuing to return more and more capital. We're selling down our public positions in a very disciplined way.[With] Didi, we're currently in a lockup period, but we believe there's significant intrinsic value there. We're not going to sell at these levels. 

WSJ: Some investors remain concerned about your performance. 

Mr. Govil: Three years ago, people used to criticize us. ""We don't know what's happening in the Vision Fund. It's a black box."" Today, if you look at our total portfolio for Fund I, 54% is either public or has been exited, and a year ago, only 28% of the portfolio was public or exited. So that's good for investors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzq37p/didi_has_a_great_intrinsic_value_as_per_cfo_of/

I spent a whole day looking for companies with a  strong balance sheet (Altman-Z = 9.86), and with growing revenues and earnings.  Revenue has increased every year since 2012, and at the time, earnings were in an upward trend.  Covid, as with most things, has affected the company's bottom line.  Since buying it at $55.20/share, it is now setting all-time highs and now sits at $356/share for a 116% per annum increase.  While I wouldn't recommend buying it since it has a fair value of $289, but I do plan on keeping this position for quite some time.

This explains it:  
The current short interest rate is 32.7% and ONLY 1.9 Days to Cover!!! According to Zacks Equity Research, SDC's Implied Volatility Surging is surging.  


FUD spreaders want you to believe that SDC has big debt, but keep in mind that they do have more than $400m cash to offset it.

For a meme stock, we don't have to use fundamental info to spread FUD. We want a short squeeze, and here are three ingredients for a short squeeze:

1. High % short of the float. CHECK. 32.7%
2. Unusual options activity. CHECK. We all know the option trade on December 17, 2021
3. Positive News Catalyst. CHECK.

Short sellers don't want us to pay attention to this. They want us to focus on numbers about debt and profit. We apes know fundamentals do not matter much for a meme stock as SDC.

**SNAP  Ruling the Meta-World : An Alpha Call**

*Disclaimer: Not a financial advice; just my view and interpretations.* 

**Brief Synopsis:** 

SNAP the self-proclaimed camera company is the de-facto founder and ruler of the Meta-world. The technologies developed by SNAP over the years have been game changer in almost all aspects and have been shamelessly copied by the major social media players. Snapchat launched the filters, stories, spotlight, in app games, social maps and many more paving the way for Snapchat being arguably the most preferred social media in the 13-24 year (90%) and 13-34 year (75%) population.

SNAP has also been well received by the product companies. Their AR (Augmented Reality) technology is far superior than any of the competition that is around. The AR helps the users to try the products (apparel and accessories) and gives them more confidence about product fit and quality. This also reduces returns to a great extent and is preferred by the manufacturers.

**The current issue pulling the stock price down:**

Apples new privacy feature that allows the user to turn off tracking has affected the targeted advertising. This has increased the cost of acquiring sale through ads in Snap and all other mobile based advertising platforms. This move has adversely affected the earnings of SNAP and it missed their own lower end of the guidance in Q3 by $3 Mn. In the words of the CEO/Founder, Evan Spiegel, While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS. 

**How will SNAP tackle this?**

But the important part here is what Evan Spiegel later said during the Q&amp;A of the earnings call, This has definitely been a frustrating setback for us, but I think over the long term these privacy changes and protecting privacy for users is really important for the long-term health of the ecosystem and something that we fully support. In the current environment it is really meaningful of a CEO to recognize this and find a way to monetize with these limitations. 

Also, when the supply chain issues start to resolve, maybe post the holiday period, advertisement revenue will pick up once again, mainly in SNAP (among social media); why? because of SNAPs incredible AR technology, its metaverse model and the user group that values its privacy and which fully utilizes the AR world. Recent brands that have started using SNAPs AR technology to target user groups include Samsung (for their wearable), Hollister, American Eagle, Ralph Lauren, HBO Max (through co-watching experience).

**Financial Performance:**

SNAP has been proving itself to investors consistently. Just looking at their numbers will prove how incredible they have been. **Heads UP:** They have not yet made a profit. But they are on the way to being mighty profitable. **Take a look at their key numbers and make a decision for yourself.** This is a long term play.

* Rivian IPO blew up. Share price $110. Now $98B market cap.
* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,190. Now $1.2T MC.
* Lucid +100% in three weeks. SP $52. Now $86B MC.

Like  you, SoFi didnt fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the  $LCID $15 dip. And sadly, I wasnt able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two  years ago.

But heres our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV pure plays in the market:

Polestar  Volvos EV spinoff brand  estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.

Its now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.

Polestar is the only global EV pure play, other than Tesla.

**History**

A little background

* Polestar  takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris  not the resourceful  co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. Thats *Polstjrnan* (literal translation, Pole Star) if youre Swedish.
* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvos partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.
* Volvo  acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by  Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands  Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4  million cars in 2020.
* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being independent since 2017.
* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.
* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.

**Comps**

**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**

&amp;#x200B;

* Applying  Teslas 2022E multiple (15.9x) to Polestar (8.7x) implies a share price of $25.15. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.76, this yields an increase of 82.78%.
* Applying Lucids 2022E multiple (40x) to Polestar (8.7x) implies a share price of  $63.26. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.76, this yields an increase  of 359.74%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xgi8klft66181.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=717f4963073e66b02893f8d6b64a678ad38b8e52

**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**

* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.
* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:

1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).
2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.

* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.
* Polestar  is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship  with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment  opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.
* As  with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related  production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US  factories going forward.

**The EV Graveyard**

The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.

But Polestar?

They've  been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when they IPOd? Answer: 1,400.

Polestar just makes cars, baby.

CEO Thomas Ingenlath: We have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.

Claim confirmed. And look at that jawline.

Polestar estimates 65,000 deliveries in FY22 and revenues in excess of $3B.

**The Product**

The  Polestar 1 came out in 2019. Its a hybrid premium sports car that will  set you back $155K 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8  seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph.  Theyre badass, and hard to find.

**Polestar 2**

The Polestar 2 launched in 2020. Polestar 2 What is it?

Think  Subaru Outback meets the Model 3  with a dash of the minimalist  Swedish      aesthetic. Its a sedan, but its higher ride- height and  rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a  hatchback. Lets call it a crossover coupe. Available now.

**Upcoming Polestar lineup**

* Polestar  3 (2022)  luxury electric SUV built in the USA at Volvos South  Carolina factory. Polestar also hopes to have the South Carolina  vehicles be union-made no easy task these days (looking at you, Austin  Elon).
* Ingenlath  (CEO): ""Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American  customers. I remember the great response when I first shared Polestar's  vision here in the USA and I am proud that our first SUV will be  manufactured in South Carolina. From now on, the USA is no longer an  export market but a home market.""

**Political / Regulatory Tailwinds**

The US and global political environment has never been more positive for investment in electric vehicles.

On  Saturday morning, the House of Representatives voted 228-206 to pass  the Build Back Better infrastructure bill totaling $1.2 trillion. This  is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.

Relevant highlights:

* The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.
* Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.
* An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.

**Brand Rollout**

While watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series last week, I saw this TV commercial:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk)

* It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.
* Launched  ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot  narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human  advancement, the way we live now and the damage we're doing to the  planet.
* Nyberg: ""Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.

***Cramer on $GGPI:***

* Theyre  connected with Polestar. OK, heres the problem: Rivian is coming  public. This group has gotten a little too hot. Lets let things cool  off before we get hurt.

Ok, Cramer has a point here, but not necessarily about GGPI. Your downside risk on LCID, TSLA, RIVN is technically limitless. GGPI on the other hand, has a NAV (net asset value) floor of approximately $10 until merger.

Well, we dont know a lot about Leos investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:

* \[CEO\]  Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake DiCaprio \[has\] in the  company. One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is  sustainability, Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. Its as well  very important for Leo. He and us being joined on that journey, him  investing in our company, obviously that makes sense for both sides.

**TL;DR**  $GGPI is taking Swedish EV auto maker Polestar public. The cars  are sexy AF, and match up well with the Tesla Model 3 on both  performance and price. Polestar has 29K cars on the road and $1.5B in  revenue in FY21, and still trades at a deep discount to other EV pure  plays.

PCs from 2012-2018 will replaced en mass over the next 2 years because of TPM requirements for Windows 11. Old servers 2012- 2018 will be replaced because new technologies make these investments worthwhile (ddr5, pcie 4 &amp; 5, gpu acceleration, machine learning, and much higher performance and lower power server CPUs.)

&amp;#x200B;

I expect well see bump from a Windows 11 push. 11 is still very new and doesnt even show up on the w3 OS platform statistics yet. 1. Many 11 sales will be organic, (people just wanting a new faster computer), but many will be forced because their computer doesnt meet system requirements.

Dells has always had a consistent server share. Frankly though, prior to 2018, there really werent too many huge performance benefits for a company to upgrade their servers.

It took a while, but there is now a lot of hardware that can utilize PCIe4. Also, PCIe5 is now being rolled out but will be hitting servers and consumer PCs in 2022.

DDR5 is in high demand, short supply, but supply should start catching up in 2022.

**Regarding separation from VMWare and most recent Earnings.**

Take this section with more than a grain of salt. Im not the greatest at maths and not an expert on sspinoffs.

&gt;!Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL) stockholders will receive .440626 of a share of Vmware, Inc Common stock, Class A (NYSE: VMW) for each share of Dell held as of October 29.!&lt;

&gt;!Dell will shed its 81% stake in VMware, creating an independent software company with a stock market value of $64 billion, Financial Times reports.!&lt;

Dell went from 85B to 42B  (IMO an overreaction)

VMW is currently worth 50B.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Extractions from FY22 earnings:**

&gt;!VMware revenue was $3.1 billion for the second quarter, up 8% driven by broad-based strength across a diverse product portfolio. Operating income for the quarter was $849 million, or 27.0% of VMware revenue.!&lt;

&gt;!Infrastructure Solutions Group revenue for the second quarter was $8.4 billion, up 3% as customers accelerate their IT investments with focus on multi-cloud solutions. Servers and networking revenue was $4.5 billion, up 6%, and storage revenue was $4.0 billion, down 1%. Operating income was $970 million for the second quarter, or approximately 11.5% of Infrastructure Solutions Group revenue.!&lt;

&gt;!Client Solutions Group revenue for the second quarter was up 27% to a record $14.3 billion. Operating income was a second quarter record $995 million, up 39%, and 7% of Client Solutions Group revenue, as the company innovates across the ecosystem to deliver an enhanced experience for customers looking to work and play effectively from anywhere. Commercial client revenue was $10.6 billion, up 32%, and consumer revenue was a second quarter record of $3.7 billion, up 17%.!&lt;

VMWare accounted for 30% operating income (849 / 2814)

VMWare accounted for 12% revenue. (3.1 / 25.8)

VMW was a considerable source of income and revenue, but I dont think warrants the price of VMW now, or the hit that it caused Dell. I think Dell investors were scared, but this earnings will put fears at ease.

2. Unusual options activity.  CHECK. We all know the option trade on December 17, 2021
3. Positive News Catalyst. CHECK. On November 15, 2021, SDC has announced the Companys innovative new treatment planning software that enables its affiliated network of state-licensed doctors to treat more patients, more accurately predict tooth movements, and better visualize their patients treatment. ([https://www.yahoo.com/now/smiledirectclub-announces-next-generation-treatment-133000622.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/smiledirectclub-announces-next-generation-treatment-133000622.html)).

Short sellers don't want us to pay attention to this. They want us to focus on numbers about debt and profit. We apes know fundamentals do not matter much for a meme stock as SDC.

I am an Ape with balls. I YOLO'ed all my money on SDC after doing my own research thoroughly, like an ape should do. My cost basis is about $4.00, now you have a better discount.

Sure it got downgraded for increased competition, but it's still at the top. Paypal is literally everywhere in our lives and posted positive earnings. I just don't get it. I bought in at 205$. Bought more at 193$. Gonna buy more at 185$. Am I autism or is it EZ multimillions dollar profits?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzotlk/the_first_pypl_millionaire/

This trend continued with other companies ($AMC, $RKT, etc...), but Ive never seen a country short squeezed. Why? What's the difference? Is it possible to pump/dump a country? I've been buying $ECH for a while, today is 11% up because of some good election results. Besides, the stock is -69% from its ATH.

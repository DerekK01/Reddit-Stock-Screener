11/15 | royal bank of canada, shares  69% (hmmm)

ocugen has no shortage of backers &amp; shorts &amp; Ocugen is up &gt; 4,000% in the past year. what does future hold for Covaxin in the US &amp; Canada? NIH director helps you narrow it down. easy doubler. wouldn't be a first

[no big deal, just the NIH director &amp; lancet study](https://preview.redd.it/fha3w1jdx5181.jpg?width=1742&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73b8c64b58c5a085d8cef59e3d77f74be3c7b7ba)

ironically, despite all of the news flow &amp; publication of covaxin phase 3 trial data revealing strong efficacy, &amp; eua granted to covaxin by indian government, ocugen's fortunes are in a similar place to where they were before who approval

earlier this week, ocugen reported q3 financials. as the clinical stage biopharma company has no product to sell, i be much eager to glean insights on two subjects: balance sheet &amp; the progress of drug pipeline, specifically in ocugens case, path forward for its vaccine covaxin which it has licensed exclusive rights in us &amp; canada from bharat bio

$107m in cash. enough to keep operations going into 2023. 11/18 announces inducement grants for 6 new employees (hmmm)

covaxin  a who approved vaccine which has proven to be much more effective than mrna products which require constant booster shots subscriptions because big dick pharma decided that subscription model yields much higher profits. has benefits that other vaccines do not, such ability to induce a th1 response, conferring cell-mediated immunity &amp; offering durable &amp; enhanced protection against delta variants, which is the primary concern at the present time

I think it's possible that us would not object to stockpiling some covaxin, which has a differentiated mechanism of action, &amp; a shelf life of up to years. to summarise the current state of affairs, i would lean toward an approval in canada  if covaxin is good enough for the who, why would it not be good enough for canada?

ocugen holds the rights to distribute covaxin in the us on behalf of bharat, &amp; a 45% share of all profits. it also has a similar deal in place for canada, standing to earn 55% of all profits. the study conducted under the ind, will help demonstrate that the data from india will be applicable to the us population. ocugen has already sought regulatory approval from health canada for covaxin to be used in that country

to this end, the 5-star h.c. wainwright analyst ramakanth swayampakula has a buy rating for $Ocugen shares, backed by a $10 price target. ramakanth senses theres an opportunity for the vaccine to make its mark

[&amp; apparently I'm convicted too](https://preview.redd.it/3smjiv7ix5181.jpg?width=572&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ac9eac7eedad76bf6c77698e942fbbb8fc18f25)

bb can't fill &amp; hasn't filled the orders in their 1.3b population of india. they are behind &amp; that was before india approved covaxin for 2-9 year olds (before) who approval, had orders from over 15 countries, mounting close to 1b orders unfilled. uses the platform of polio vaccines i.e. proven the safest

ocugen will rip over highs (again) once orders start pouring in. I see $18 on first revenue source

https://preview.redd.it/grhpetrmx5181.jpg?width=1610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32f02782e8405990db646d0d03dfa951bbcbd59f

ocugen announced eua for covaxin for pediatric patients 2-18 yrs old, supported by a phase 2/3 pediatric study in india. results from the study of 526 children display similar outcome to phase 3 study (in adult study, covaxin showed 77.8% efficacy &amp; 93.4% efficacy rate against severe disease

there has been a spurt in global interest in covaxin for pediatric use. clinical data from 2-18 age group has also been well received by several countries. only covaxin has such data in covid vaccines for such age group. several countries are now mulling import of covaxin for their paediatric populations

the neutralizing antibody responses against wild-type strain in the pediatric age group of 2-18 years were equivalent to those seen in adults, ages 18+ years, in bharat biotechs large phase 3 efficacy &amp; safety trial. the inactivated virus platform has been used for decades in vaccines for the pediatric population

meanwhile, ocugen entered into an agreement with cansino over gene therapy product candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration

now, did you want to talk about ocugen healing the many mutations that cause blindness all at once on the harvard platform? hell nay, these hit writers for the bears don't tell you about that. yep, it's going to human trials now to heal the blind, meaning they can probably start selling for healing blind animals now &amp; if successful in human trials, this is the next potential $50b company

ocugen is guilty of many parabolic moves. 4000% gains got praise from analysts who have watched as the under-the-radar biotech company focusing on developing gene therapies targeting eye disease partnered with bharat biotech that had already won authorization for its covid-19 vaccine covaxin in india. bharat wanted a partner to help get covaxin into the u.s. market. it picked ocugen

lolz at mms using dark pool to buy &amp; the market to sell into retail thinking they smart using ladder attacks &amp; give illusion of a steep sell off. with on chain data easy to tell they accumulating whole time some news comes out. buy the rumor sell the news. they want you to once again sit out the next 12 months like you did the last 12 months missing out on 4000% gains. do your own dd &amp; don't listen to bearish hit writers trying to get retailers to sell so tutes can buy them out

upcoming  canada day, betches. it's going to be a glorious weekend. a former monster showing strength again on volume spikes. uptrending into an ascending wedge that could easily squeeze through the $15 level next week

prepare for fire works. bb will announce orders, ocugen will produce 50% of those orders. canada &amp; US still in play. hodl or watch for dip entrance or next volume resistance break on hourly chart. start out 1/4 of your position &amp; have fun making money. easy doubler. wouldn't be a first",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qznkdk/g_spot_ocugen_back_in_play_canada_day/

1,"11/22/2021, 22:49:17","NOVAVAX - first ""traditional"" Covid-19 vaccine",dkbbroker," **# The Group**

Novavax   is a US pharmaceutical company that received $1.6 billion from the   Trump administration in 2020 to develop a protein-based Covid-19   vaccine. The group had previously researched and developed many   vaccines, but never received regulatory approval.

&amp;#x200B;

**# The vaccine**

The   vaccine now developed, ""NVX-CoV2373"", is the result of past efforts  and  has not only performed well compared to the Group's other vaccines,  but  is nearing the end of the accelerated EU review process and thus  free  for enter the market.

The  vaccine  has already been approved in Indonesia and the EU Drug  Administration  also said that the review has already started and the  decision is  expected to be announced ""in a few weeks."" So the signals  are good that  this will still happen in 2021.

The approval application for the U.S. is also planned by the end of the year.

If approved, the vaccine would be the world's first approved inactivated vaccine against covid-19.

So   unlike the four other approved mRNA/vector vaccines, this one does not   receive a genetic ""blueprint"" for production of the antigen by the   patient's own body, but instead introduces an inactive covid pathogen   into the immune system. So, as it is already known from other vaccines   that we know for decades.

&amp;#x200B;

**# Why this vaccine**

Since   it is now scientifically proven that the current vaccinations have a   much shorter efficacy than initially hoped for (maximum 6 months), the   recommendation is to perform the so-called booster vaccination   regularly.

Thereby the vaccination rates (according to [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID\_WRL](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL)) of the complete vaccination (i.e. double vaccinated) are worldwide at 41% and in Germany for example at 67%.

Many   of the unvaccinated have doubts about the so far less researched mRNA   or vector method and would prefer a ""classical"" dead vaccine. I could   imagine that also many would rather reach for the dead vaccine in case   of a (regular) booster.

&amp;#x200B;

**# The competition**

Besides Novavax, two other companies are publicly working on a dead vaccine.

One   is the French/Austrian company Valneva with ""VLA2001"", which is also   already in a large phase 3 study and is also achieving good results.   However, these are not that far along in the process and even though   Covid is, of course, an extremely hot patch, approvals take several   months. Applications have not yet been submitted for review here.

The   same is true for the French vaccine from Vidprevtyn. There are no   efficacy or side effect figures there at this time, nor an expected   date.

Ergo, Novavx is the only company that is close to approval and has a realistic chance of shaking up the vaccine market.

&amp;#x200B;

**# The numbers**

The   current market cap is \~$14B with a current share price of $193. In the  6  month chart, the price looks very interesting right now after being  at  $260 USD in September.

I have  to  honestly say now that I didn't even look that closely at the balance   sheet because I feel it is irrelevant in this context. Basically, of   course, 2020 went much better than the years before but in my estimation   the real bang comes with the (expected) EU approval in a few weeks.

The   equity/debt ratio is currently at 40/60 and revenues were at USD   $475.6M in 2020 which corresponds to a change in revenue of a whopping   2,448%. Now, of course, one could say that a lot of capital has already   flowed in here, but this is mainly due to the financial injection by  the  US government described above.

Should   the valuation grow to a level similar to that of the other 4   pharmaceutical companies, then there is still a lot of potential here.

For   comparison, you can take a look at the growth of the four   pharmaceutical companies that have an approved vaccine on the market:

\- BioNTech

\- Moderna

\- AstraZeneca

\- Janssen-Cilag

&amp;#x200B;

**# Conclusion**

Since   the vaccine is already in use, no side effects have been observed, it   has a high efficacy and the EU has already secured 200 million doses,  it  can be assumed that the approval is almost a mere formality.

Given   the general lack of confidence and the disappointing performance of   some of the current vaccines, I personally expect demand to be extremely   strong.

The current entry price at the current valuation should thus be very lucrative.

Zillow was a really big buy for me I bought 250 shares on an average purchase price of $89 I thought Zillow had a lot of potential to go to $125 so even though I don't usually put more then 10% of my portfolio in one company I thought is saw a great deal so I put a lot of money in to it I thought I got a great deal at 89

Lemonade I bought on an average purchase price of $64 to me it looked like the robinhood of insurance and I thought I got another great steal because I thought it can hit $90

PayPal I bought 50 shares on an average purchase price of $225 yet again I thought I had a great deal but the stock is really tanking

Fubo tv I bought for an average of $25 I really loved how they are growing they have 1 million subscribers and its a good tv provider for very cheap

Apple was  a really good investment for me it gave me a really nice return I bought at 100 shares at $120

RAD's Short interest has been on a steady increase since February of this year. However if you look deeper. This has been a repeating theme at least once a year. This is all mathematical. 

Back 3yrs ago. Rite Aid's management did a 1 share for 20 shares reverse split. This happened after a failed vote for a merger with Albertsons (ACI), or as I like to call them, Albertscam. Cerberus is the big money investors behind Albertsons so they could be likely behind this short play. Who knows, but it Big Money. 

Shorts went all in on shorting RAD right before that reverse split. That's how Shorts got trapped. By my calculations the Short's comment had to be at least $500 million at the time because equaled 20% of RAD's float. Now that was at $2 a RAD, but RAD had over a Billion  shares outstanding. That would be $40 post split. 

That's how it all begun. Since then. RAD Shorts haven't been cover under 10 million shares without a major spike. Believe me they have tried. RAD's fundamentals have all  improved.  On revenue, on debt, on assets, and on liabilities. Shorts are no closer to covering RAD today than they were  3 1/2 years ago. If you look at a 5yr chart. It proves my point that Shorts are trapped. There is a negative 10 million share Short Wall. I talked about this for 3 years on other message boards,  but I said to myself. Let's see what others might think. On to of short interest Institutional ownership has also increased. With some major Funds ownership at close to 10%. Institutional ownership is up by 20% from what it was just 3 years ago.

 RAD's percentage of shares shorted  hasn't been under 13% for 3 years at anytime. Shorts attempt to cover RAD shares under this 10 million share Wall and the spike RAD's price. Took RAD up to $32. The best Shorts could gain with that attempt was to cover 2.5 million shares. Factor that gain by 3 and you get a RAD price of $90.

**Company profile:**

*The world is moving to a new economic model, where data is driving value creation in ways we had not imagined just a few years ago. Data is todays new business currency, and memory and storage are strategic differentiators which will redefine how we extract value from data to expand the global economy and transform our society.*

*As the leader in innovative memory solutions, Micron is helping the world make sense of data by delivering technology that is transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Through our global brands  Micron and Crucial  we offer the industrys broadest portfolio. We are the only company manufacturing todays major memory and storage technologies: DRAM, NAND, and NOR technology.*

**Introduction:**

[MU 1D chart](https://imgur.com/ZVG0IKv)

**Don't sell MU now, it outperformed most of it's peers**
*MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC was among the best performers on Friday. It returned +7.8% to close at 83.03. On a day when the overall market breadth was 44%, it closed higher than 68% of the market. In comparison, the benchmark SP500 index closed today at -0.0014%.*

This is going to be a DD focused on the value of the products (Micron and Crucial memory, data center presence, and consumer use), as well as the value of the company.

Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).

MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&amp;P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.

*We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021, wrote Muse.*

Muse noted that WSt expectations for Microns Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Microns earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.

*And once they dowe think the stock action could be fast, Muse wrote. We also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.*
*Other reasons for the climb:*
* Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a research note that recent channel checks show there has been increased demand for DRAM memory among PC makers, and that a pricing correction in the DRAM market is drawing to a close.
* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving due to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.
* Earlier this week hedge fund Appaloosa Management said it recently sold off almost 3 million shares of MU, to leave the fund with 2.75 million shares.
**Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron**

Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MUs total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.  [The company is improving its 1-alpha DRAM](https://www.micron.com/1alpha-dram-technology) to compete with Samsung/SK Hynix.
The DRAM market is expected to grow over the long term, due to rising DRAM use in smartphones, PCs, consumer electronics, automotive and industrials. 

*Smartphones:* 
[Since 2016 the average DRAM capacity has risen from 2.4GB to 4.75GB (average of iOS and Android).](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartphones-dram-trends-2019-2020/) Micron has stated that 5G phones feature 50% more DRAM than 4G phones. It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PCs living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase. For example, think about how old iPhones struggle to run new versions of iOS, partially due to insufficient DRAM in older models. 

[Check this graph!](https://imgur.com/d9oI7WW)

*Data Center:*
DRAM is integral in servers, notably in data centre applications, it is rapidly evolving to support growing workloads for AI, big data and machine learning. Micron is working on DDR5 to support data center transitions to DDR5 platforms this year.
Data creation is projected to grow at a rate of around 23% in the next 5 years. This would require larger cloud infrastructure in order to handle this. Data centres are generally backed up by an SSD storage array, Micron remains committed to this through its NVMe SSD portfolio, and is introducing PCIe 4.0 data centre SSDs. As demand for cloud storage rises, Micron could see increased demand for these products. 

*PC/Gaming:*
Faster RAM leads to faster processing speeds. Intensive use of PCs such as gaming, video editing and streaming require better and more efficient RAM.
From Statista, the chart below shows increasing PC DRAM memory density, with the share of memory &gt;[4GB increasing to 82% in 2020](https://imgur.com/w9w0xPq) 
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/781438/worldwide-computer-dram-shipment-market-share-by-density/)

*Automotive DRAM:*
Automotive DRAM only accounts for 1.8% of the DRAM market currently. However, advances in automotive tech such as autonomous driving and vehicle connectivity will drive an increase in this. The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).

*Industrials &amp; Consumer Electronics:*
DRAM is used in systems/equipment in manufacturing processes. Industrial type DRAM is more focused on providing a stable solution for reliability. Automation and IoT (Internet of Things) is likely to increase demand for memory/increased memory. In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. 
Another important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. 

**My Nvidia thesis:**

**I worked as a qualified IT Hardware, Networking and Software Engineer for 5 or 6 years, and am now an Engineering student at college. Im a computer geek, especially for hardware. So Im going to enjoy writing this part. I hope my knowledge lends to it.**


Although you wont find much correlation in the [charts](https://imgur.com/o3EaSAV), apart from the recent semi-boom. Nvidia and Micron are very strongly linked. 


*Increasing penetration of GPUs in data centres*


Recently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPUs. GPUs lend themselves perfectly towards [Machine Learning (ML-OLD) functions in data centres](https://www.eetimes.com/ai-chip-menu-expands-for-data-centers/).

Now remember that GPUs are highly memory intensive. 
This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidias newest chip, the A100 GPU just released, [designed for AI in data centers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer).

The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidias new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, *40GB of memory*, and *1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth.* *Theres also a version using 80GB!*

*Smarter and Faster Memory*
A100 brings massive amounts of compute to data centers. To keep those compute engines fully utilized, it has a class-leading 2 terabytes per second (TB/sec) of memory bandwidth, more than double the previous generation. In addition, A100 has significantly more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache7X larger than the previous generationto maximize compute performance.*

I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPUs use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron *does* manufacture the [HBM2E memory used in the A100](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/hbm2e#:~:text=HBM2E%20%7C%20Micron%20Technologies%2C%20Inc), hence I suspect Micron is one of their memory vendors for their data centre GPUs. 

I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the worlds first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPUs with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use [Micron NVME drives](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/pdf/dgxa100-service-manual.pdf). See below:

Who is the world's only manufacturer of GDDR5X and GDDR6X memory? Micron. 
*Micron has created the worlds fastest discrete graphics memory solution, GDDR6X. GDDR6X was launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 GPUs (including Ti) to take graphics beyond gaming into true AI.

[Comparison between GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X](https://imgur.com/fl8FY68)

This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPUs (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPUs. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well. 

**Overall I would conclude as long as Nvidia remains strong/bullish, you can be bullish on Micron as Nvidia are dependent on them for their products, particularly in the high-end.**


**The AMD link**

Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD [are using Micron GDDR6 memory in their RX6000 series graphics cards:](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-high-performance-gddr6-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6000)

Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture. Using Microns advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Todays announcement continues Microns rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions.

Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective, said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.

**Is Micron a buy right now?**

For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases).

Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.

Micron believes that secular growth drivers such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND. **I covered this in the Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron section of my DD. Thus I think Micron is justified in this belief and spending plan.** Gill thinks its a good move, and worries are overblown.

*The current spending plan, said the 5-star analyst, When annualized and put into context, is nothing out of the ordinary and should neither cause significant increases in industry capacity (so there should be no resulting price wars from the competition) nor be a significant drag on free cash flow, which would continue to grow and reach historical highs as a % of sales.*

Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on.

In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a high level of capital return flexibility, which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for competitive reasons, it will also provide a safety buffer for more R&amp;D or CapEx spending.

Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, Ill add more recent figures in the following section). 

[The 47 rating InvestorsObserver gives to Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) stock puts it near the middle of the Semiconductors industry. In addition to scoring higher than 38 percent of stocks in the Semiconductors industry, MUs 47 overall rating means the stock scores better than 47 percent of all stocks.](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/does-micron-technology-inc-mu-have-what-it-takes-to-be-in-your-portfolio-friday)

**Has Micron Run Its Cyclical Course?**

I will be heavily sourcing from [this great and recent Nasdaq article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/has-micron-run-its-cyclical-course) for this section.

On the face of it, year-to-date, Microns stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.

This fall is due to Microns cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.

The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. 

Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the companys guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.

A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.

Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.

The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality. **Refer to my section about GDDR6X memory, Micron is delivering TOP quality.**

Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.
[Here is a useful article explaining the volatility of MU this past month.](https://investchronicle.com/2021/11/16/here-is-why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-volatility-recorded-over-the-last-month-was-2-30/)

Tipranks Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.

The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.
A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.

**Upcoming Quarterly Sales/Next Earnings**

[Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 
On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. 
Micron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th.  The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.

**[this chart is beautiful](https://imgur.com/lP5mBYE) - Nov 19:**
very nice rally after a downtrend breakout here on MU ! today we are approaching a big resistance zones on the RSI and chart.

We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off.


**[MU Long setup](https://imgur.com/ShnyQn8) - Nov 18:**
MU after correction, going for final push for W-1 of W-5

**[MU TRADE IDEA](https://imgur.com/z3mjHUK) - Nov 16:**
Upside looks limited from here. Expecting us to pullback into a corrective wave 2 into a very buyable dip around $70. Be patient on this one, it's only getting started My gut says this guy is incorrect tbh, given the recent push. 


**[After 200 days we can see a breakout](https://imgur.com/Vmhx9Al) - Nov 12, very in-depth:**
Today we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:

1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse

2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges

3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.

4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.

5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)

6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)

7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.

8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)

**Im a regard that wants to YOLO options, what do I do?**

*Disclaimer: I have a good history with options, but I only trade (for the most part) 1 month, or 6 month options, or 1 year or 2 year LEAPS. I would advise to go for LEAPS and shares for this stock - either ITM or slightly OTM. If it becomes ITM, you can always roll to a higher strike if you wish.*

*High-risk:*
Be regarded and YOLO to play earnings on December 20th. I would suggest either buying ITM 80c or slightly OTM 85c for December 23 or December 31st. 90c if you like crayons. 

* [December 2021 options chain](https://imgur.com/QD3ROzy)

*Medium risk:*
Buy 80c, 82.5c, 85c for April, June, July or September. Or if youre regarded 87.50 and 90c.Play on the thesis that MU has a lot of value, will do well in December earnings (maybe), has great products, and that the downtrend is beginning to turn into an uptrend as I believe. I would suggest buying shares also.

**Where should I enter? (options or shares):**

Look out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.

**Conclusion:**

I think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds. 

TL;DR:

* MU bounced on Friday, perhaps this is the sign that its downtrend is reversing.

* Higher future DRAM demand will push up Micron. DRAM is used in Smartphones, Data centres, PC/Gaming, Automotive, Industrials and Consumer Electronics. Increased demand in these sectors will drive up Microns value. 

* Nvidia uses Micron memory in its data centre GPUs.

* Nvidias ONLY supplier of GDDR6X memory used in higher-end gaming GPUs is Micron. Nvidia is dependent on them for this high-performance memory.

* AMD are using Micron GDDR6(not X) memory in their RX 6000 series GPUs.

* Microns downtrend has changed in November. 

* Micron intends to spend $150 billion combined on Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D.

* $130 price target from Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.

* Micron moves based on the supply/demand for memory.

* Micron may have bottomed out now, and is due to go up.

* Tipranks Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.
The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.

* [Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research.

**Don't sell MU now, it outperformed most of it's peers**
*MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC was among the best performers on Friday. It returned +7.8% to close at 83.03. On a day when the overall market breadth was 44%, it closed higher than 68% of the market. In comparison, the benchmark SP500 index closed today at -0.0014%.*

This is going to be a DD focused on the value of the products (Micron and Crucial memory, data center presence, and consumer use), as well as the value of the company.

Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).

MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&amp;P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.

*We believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021, wrote Muse.*

Muse noted that WSt expectations for Microns Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Microns earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.

*And once they dowe think the stock action could be fast, Muse wrote. We also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.*
*Other reasons for the climb:*
* Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a research note that recent channel checks show there has been increased demand for DRAM memory among PC makers, and that a pricing correction in the DRAM market is drawing to a close.
* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving due to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.
* Earlier this week hedge fund Appaloosa Management said it recently sold off almost 3 million shares of MU, to leave the fund with 2.75 million shares.
**Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron**

Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MUs total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.  [The company is improving its 1-alpha DRAM](https://www.micron.com/1alpha-dram-technology) to compete with Samsung/SK Hynix.
The DRAM market is expected to grow over the long term, due to rising DRAM use in smartphones, PCs, consumer electronics, automotive and industrials. 

*Smartphones:* 
[Since 2016 the average DRAM capacity has risen from 2.4GB to 4.75GB (average of iOS and Android).](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartphones-dram-trends-2019-2020/) Micron has stated that 5G phones feature 50% more DRAM than 4G phones. It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PCs living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase. For example, think about how old iPhones struggle to run new versions of iOS, partially due to insufficient DRAM in older models. 

[Check this graph!](https://imgur.com/d9oI7WW)

*Data Center:*
DRAM is integral in servers, notably in data centre applications, it is rapidly evolving to support growing workloads for AI, big data and machine learning. Micron is working on DDR5 to support data center transitions to DDR5 platforms this year.
Data creation is projected to grow at a rate of around 23% in the next 5 years. This would require larger cloud infrastructure in order to handle this. Data centres are generally backed up by an SSD storage array, Micron remains committed to this through its NVMe SSD portfolio, and is introducing PCIe 4.0 data centre SSDs. As demand for cloud storage rises, Micron could see increased demand for these products. 

*PC/Gaming:*
Faster RAM leads to faster processing speeds. Intensive use of PCs such as gaming, video editing and streaming require better and more efficient RAM.
From Statista, the chart below shows increasing PC DRAM memory density, with the share of memory &gt;[4GB increasing to 82% in 2020](https://imgur.com/w9w0xPq) 
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/781438/worldwide-computer-dram-shipment-market-share-by-density/)

*Automotive DRAM:*
Automotive DRAM only accounts for 1.8% of the DRAM market currently. However, advances in automotive tech such as autonomous driving and vehicle connectivity will drive an increase in this. The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).

*Industrials &amp; Consumer Electronics:*
DRAM is used in systems/equipment in manufacturing processes. Industrial type DRAM is more focused on providing a stable solution for reliability. Automation and IoT (Internet of Things) is likely to increase demand for memory/increased memory. In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. 
Another important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. 

**My Nvidia thesis:**

**I worked as a qualified IT Hardware, Networking and Software Engineer for 5 or 6 years, and am now an Engineering student at college. Im a computer geek, especially for hardware. So Im going to enjoy writing this part. I hope my knowledge lends to it.**


Although you wont find much correlation in the [charts](https://imgur.com/o3EaSAV), apart from the recent semi-boom. Nvidia and Micron are very strongly linked. 


*Increasing penetration of GPUs in data centres*


Recently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPUs. GPUs lend themselves perfectly towards [Machine Learning (ML-OLD) functions in data centres](https://www.eetimes.com/ai-chip-menu-expands-for-data-centers/).

Now remember that GPUs are highly memory intensive. 
This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidias newest chip, the A100 GPU just released, [designed for AI in data centers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer).
[You can also read more here.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)

The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidias new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, *40GB of memory*, and *1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth.* *Theres also a version using 80GB!*

*Smarter and Faster Memory*
A100 brings massive amounts of compute to data centers. To keep those compute engines fully utilized, it has a class-leading 2 terabytes per second (TB/sec) of memory bandwidth, more than double the previous generation. In addition, A100 has significantly more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache7X larger than the previous generationto maximize compute performance.*

I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPUs use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron *does* manufacture the [HBM2E memory used in the A100](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/hbm2e#:~:text=HBM2E%20%7C%20Micron%20Technologies%2C%20Inc), hence I suspect Micron is one of their memory vendors for their data centre GPUs. 

I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the worlds first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPUs with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use [Micron NVME drives](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/pdf/dgxa100-service-manual.pdf). See below:

*GDDR6X and GDDR5X memory in Nvidia high-end graphic cards:*
The GTX1080, 1080Ti, and Pascal Nvidia TitanX all used GDDR5X memory.
The RTX 3080 and 3090 GPUs use GDDR6X memory.
Who is the world's only manufacturer of GDDR5X and GDDR6X memory? Micron. 
*Micron has created the worlds fastest discrete graphics memory solution, GDDR6X. GDDR6X was launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 GPUs (including Ti) to take graphics beyond gaming into true AI. Watch to learn how Micron was able to achieve incredible speeds up to 1 TB/s system memory bandwidth.*

[Comparison between GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X](https://imgur.com/fl8FY68)

This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPUs (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPUs. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well. 

**Overall I would conclude as long as Nvidia remains strong/bullish, you can be bullish on Micron as Nvidia are dependent on them for their products, particularly in the high-end.**


**The AMD link**

Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD [are using Micron GDDR6 memory in their RX6000 series graphics cards:](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-high-performance-gddr6-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6000)

Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture. Using Microns advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Todays announcement continues Microns rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions.

Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective, said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.

**Is Micron a buy right now?**

For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases).

Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.

Micron believes that secular growth drivers such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND. **I covered this in the Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron section of my DD. Thus I think Micron is justified in this belief and spending plan.** Gill thinks its a good move, and worries are overblown.

*The current spending plan, said the 5-star analyst, When annualized and put into context, is nothing out of the ordinary and should neither cause significant increases in industry capacity (so there should be no resulting price wars from the competition) nor be a significant drag on free cash flow, which would continue to grow and reach historical highs as a % of sales.*

Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on.

In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a high level of capital return flexibility, which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for competitive reasons, it will also provide a safety buffer for more R&amp;D or CapEx spending.

Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, Ill add more recent figures in the following section). 

[The 47 rating InvestorsObserver gives to Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) stock puts it near the middle of the Semiconductors industry. In addition to scoring higher than 38 percent of stocks in the Semiconductors industry, MUs 47 overall rating means the stock scores better than 47 percent of all stocks.](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/does-micron-technology-inc-mu-have-what-it-takes-to-be-in-your-portfolio-friday)

**Has Micron Run Its Cyclical Course?**

I will be heavily sourcing from [this great and recent Nasdaq article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/has-micron-run-its-cyclical-course) for this section.

On the face of it, year-to-date, Microns stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.

This fall is due to Microns cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.

The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. 

Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the companys guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.

A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.

Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.

The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality. **Refer to my section about GDDR6X memory, Micron is delivering TOP quality.**

Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.
[Here is a useful article explaining the volatility of MU this past month.](https://investchronicle.com/2021/11/16/here-is-why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-volatility-recorded-over-the-last-month-was-2-30/)

Tipranks Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.

The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.
A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.

**Upcoming Quarterly Sales/Next Earnings**

[Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 
On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. 
Micron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th.  The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.

**Most recent TA from Tradingview ideas:**

**[this chart is beautiful](https://imgur.com/lP5mBYE) - Nov 19:**
very nice rally after a downtrend breakout here on MU ! today we are approaching a big resistance zones on the RSI and chart.

We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off.


**[MU Long setup](https://imgur.com/ShnyQn8) - Nov 18:**
MU after correction, going for final push for W-1 of W-5

**[MU TRADE IDEA](https://imgur.com/z3mjHUK) - Nov 16:**
Upside looks limited from here. Expecting us to pullback into a corrective wave 2 into a very buyable dip around $70. Be patient on this one, it's only getting started My gut says this guy is incorrect tbh, given the recent push. 


**[After 200 days we can see a breakout](https://imgur.com/Vmhx9Al) - Nov 12, very in-depth:**
Today we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:

1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse

2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges

3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.

4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.

5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)

6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)

7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.

8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)

**Im a regard that wants to YOLO options, what do I do?**

*Disclaimer: I have a good history with options, but I only trade (for the most part) 1 month, or 6 month options, or 1 year or 2 year LEAPS. I would advise to go for LEAPS and shares for this stock - either ITM or slightly OTM. If it becomes ITM, you can always roll to a higher strike if you wish.*

*High-risk:*
Be regarded and YOLO to play earnings on December 20th. I would suggest either buying ITM 80c or slightly OTM 85c for December 23 or December 31st. 90c if you like crayons. 

* [December 2021 options chain](https://imgur.com/QD3ROzy)

*Medium risk:*
Buy 80c, 82.5c, 85c for April, June, July or September. Or if youre regarded 87.50 and 90c.Play on the thesis that MU has a lot of value, will do well in December earnings (maybe), has great products, and that the downtrend is beginning to turn into an uptrend as I believe. I would suggest buying shares also.

**Where should I enter? (options or shares):**

Look out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.

**Conclusion:**

I think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds. 

TL;DR:

* MU bounced on Friday, perhaps this is the sign that its downtrend is reversing.

* Higher future DRAM demand will push up Micron. DRAM is used in Smartphones, Data centres, PC/Gaming, Automotive, Industrials and Consumer Electronics. Increased demand in these sectors will drive up Microns value. 

* Nvidia uses Micron memory in its data centre GPUs.

* Nvidias ONLY supplier of GDDR6X memory used in higher-end gaming GPUs is Micron. Nvidia is dependent on them for this high-performance memory.

* AMD are using Micron GDDR6(not X) memory in their RX 6000 series GPUs.

* Microns downtrend has changed in November. 

* Micron intends to spend $150 billion combined on Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D.

* $130 price target from Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.

* Micron moves based on the supply/demand for memory.

* Micron may have bottomed out now, and is due to go up.

* Tipranks Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.
The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.

* [Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. 

* On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. 
Micron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th.  The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.

So if you want to dive inside check those out.

As a german I just see one thing missing, the time. The 3 political partys that will reign over germany started the talks to find a way to reign together (Koalitionsvertrag). But it will take time to finish that. After they started to reign it will take a lot more time to change the law because they need to prioritise on other things that are more important. 

So my guess is that we will see Tilray skyrocket maybe in summer 2022 till then the anticipation and the start of the makeover of the law will push Tilray upwards but if you want to play Tilray you need to HODL.

Im bullish on Tilray thats why I bought my first 10 shares @ 10,38 avg but I will buy more over the next few months. Position: [https://ibb.co/P9NrRT1](https://ibb.co/P9NrRT1)

1,"11/22/2021, 19:07:26",Harmonychain analysis,Fit_Shelter2581,"Harmonychain (HMONY, ISIN NO0010921299) was listed on Euronext Growth Oslo, in May 2021. First day it was traded in the range 1,77 to 2.40 NOK pr stock. In March 2021 the company Issued 61 million stocks to market for 1.80 NOK pr stock (approx. 0,20 $ per stock). Total number of stocks in Harmonychain is 173 million. This amounts to an issue a bit above 12 mill $ and a marketcap close to 35 mill $. The company still has 10 mill $ of this issued capital in cash. There are no issues with liquidity.

*Arctic Core:*

Harmonychain AS, owns 100% two companies. Artic Core AS and Lokotech AS. Artic Core is a Norwegian datacenter company, building up multiple datasenters powered by hydropower in remote locations in Norway. This to both ensure that blockchain validation is run off eco friendly power, but also to take advantage of cheap electricity prices in the more rural regions of Norway. Prices in north of Norway is in average 1/10th as prices in Texas US (a well know mining location). But there are also other large advantages, 98% of all produced power in Norway is hydropower, and temperature outside Norway is naturally very low which makes operation cheaper and effective than compared to 45 degC in US Texas. Norway is also deemed to be one of the more political stable countries in the world which also are attractive for many customers. The integrity of the electric power grid is also deemed to be high. Power outages virtually never happens. All this stack up to be some of the most attractive mining business plans on the planet. With latest generation of hardware 70 to 250 $/MWh is expected revenue generation. In Norway, all the mentioned factors is not only maximizing profitability by delivering very low operations cost (cooling and power) but also by being ecofriendly (Eco Blockchains). Cost of running a 1 MWh mining (effieicnet farm) could be as much as 125 $/kWh to150 $/MWh (12 cent pr kWh). Some of the larger farms in Texas get lower power prices by signing agreements to shut down mining rigs as soon as they are asked to from grid company. Power prices can be as low as 4 cent in these agreements. This does however impact efficiency and revenue and will of course reduce profitability for that reason as mining equipment is expensive to have on shelf without being in operation. In Northern Norway cost is likely to be no more than 25 $/MWh. In other words where a West Texas farm (24 h operation) with 200 $ revenue/MWh and perhaps 50 $/MWh  75 $/MWh EBITDA/MWh, a northern Norwegian mining farm can have up to 175 $/MWh.

Harmonychain announced that they have developed and launched its own proprietary Scryptpool software in October. This makes them a highly attractive company for Collocated Eco Blockchain validation/mining. They are just about to start full scale operation in the next weeks and months (Halden data cenetr opened 16th Nov). Multiple incoming announcements to the market is also expected on new datacenter locations to the north. Right now, they are ramping up their first datacenter in Halden. Their site has large industrial powerlines with Transformators on site feeding power. It is deemed that this site can deliver 100 MW give or take. Halden is a bit further to the south of Norway which probably increases mining cost to approximately 90 $/MWh. Still, profit can be as high as 110 $/MWh. With 97% operations stability this amounts to an EBITDA of 256 000 $/day or almost 93 million $ pr year. Depreciation over 2 years would turn this into an EBIT of approximately 64 million $ if all equipment is new. This is the Halden datacenter alone. If you just add 1 datacenter (100 MW) in the North (Kautokeino) with operations stability 97% and 175 $/MWh, Artic core would in total have EBITDA that equals 660 000$/day. This is close to 240 million $ per year. Today Harmonychains marketcap is 17 million $.

Harmonychains business model for Arctic Core is however not only to invest and mine krypto for their own revenue stream. They intend also to sell collocated server services and mining pools where harmonychains reward will be Royalty (could be as much as 30% og reward). This basically means that the investments and revenue for Harmonychain in practice will be lower for the two scenarios mentioned above, but EBIT could be much closer to EBITDA as depreciation and invested capital with this model is much lower. Regardless of errors one can imagine in the given estimates, even if EBIT come in at only 50% of 240 million $ per year (which is 120 million $ per year), this holds a massive promise for a company only valuated to 17 million $. Harmonychain with an EBIT or EAT at close to 120 million $ would have an forward P/E of 0,15 the way harmonychain is priced now. I have concluded that norwegian investors are lacking knowledge of the Blockchain industry, and that this is probably the most likely cause of the market not having priced Harmonychain higher. Foreign investors have either not learned to know that harmonychain exist as the company was just listed 6 months back, or are not familiar with the hydropower situation in Norway (check northpool)

*Lokotech::*

The second company Harmonychain owns (100%) is Lokotech. Lokotech is the most known part of Harmonychains business. Lokotech has developed a design and a circuit model for an Scrypt ASIC (supercomputer specifically developed to mine) which they call the Bulldozer. This ASIC has 4 times as efficient hash/Joule rate as the latest Bitmain ASIC for Scrypt mining (the L7). This has raised many eyebrows. Bitmain is a massive Chinese company valuated to more than 100 Billion $. How likely is it that a 17 million $ challenger from Norway can win against Bitmain on the Scryptcoin market? The design simulations are very promising so fare. CEO recently presented that their chip can do 10 to 15 MHash/Joule which is almost 4 time as energy effective compared to the Bitmains best model that was just launched. But few of Norways old shipping and oil industry investors know what hashrate is. The news of 10 to 15 MH/ Joule have not moved Harmonychains value. Lokotech sends Wafer to production in March. If they pull off this design and production, they estimate that they can sell each Bulldozer ASIC for approximately 10 000 $ per unit. Production cost is likely to be approximately 2000 $. Harmonychain have guided that they want to sell at least 60 000 units pr year. This alone would be a revenue stream of 600 million $ pr year. Harmonychain market cap is 17 mill $.

*Chance of success:*

Arctic Core has very high chance of success. The Scryptpool software is already in alpha testing. The Halden datacenter is already in operation and has by statements of the CEO already mining activity. Due to this it seems like the company have much of the technology and resources to make Arctic Core happen. When it comes to the datacenters to the North there is normal regulation work to be done before these centers can be started. There will always be some risk associated with that. But there are many counties in Northern Norway that are both cold and have extremely low cost/kWh. Its likely that they will get approval for more centers somewhere in the north. There is an ongoing application process in the small town Kautokeino. But it has been mentioned that there are also other initiatives ongoing.

Lokotech AS, are doing hardware engineering of extremely complex nature. Its hard to know if the prototype they will receive after Wafer production in May 2022 will deliver fully as expected. But normally when a world class hardware engineer program and convert code to circuits for chip manufacturing this should work. Its a standard process, that definitely have been done before. There are speculations among Harmonychain investors that the new chip Lokotech is designing is based on FinFet technology as opposed to MosFet. A few thinks this can be the reason for the drastic reduction in power consumption on Lokotechs chip for Scrypt mining. In other words, it could be that they are on to something than can become a success.

*In Summary:*

Both Artic Core and Lokotech has the potential to increase Harmonychains market cap and stock price 10 to 100 times if they have success. Harmonychain is currently priced lower than when listed on Euronext Growth Oslo. The reason for this is most likely due to the krypto crash in May/June as well as Harmonychain announced temporarily in June that they had some trouble with the effectivity of the chip. However, 16th of August Harmonychain announced that they were back on track and this time with even higher MHash/Joule than earlier. But Norwegian investors did not reward Harmonychain with a correction back to previous heights. The stock is still at 50% discount compared to listing price. Company marketcap is 17 mill $, with close to 10 mill $ in cash. Cash burn rate has so fare in 2021 been close to 300 000 $ pr quarter. In summary risk to the low side seem acceptable, while there is an massive upside potential that the market just seem to ignore. This could be due to the typical Norwegian investor know very little about virtual currencies. This could however be a huge opportunity for investors knowing more about this type of business.

*Triggers:*

* Updates to the market about the progress of Locotechs chip. Manual place and route process which they are in now is expected to deliver even better performance.
* MOU/LOI or contracts on ASIC orders from new customers or collaborators.
* New data center customers to Artic Core
* New data center approvals from government
* Other companies bidding on Harmonychain take over. In December before listed, Harmonychain was offered close to 50% of DLTX. Answer was no, but other larger companies might take interest in Harmonychains technology and try to buy them at this extremely low price.
* Virtual currency Rally. It is hard to guess how much virtual currencyHarmonychain owns right now. But we do know that they have started mining. Its therefore likely that positive development in virtual currency also should impact Harmonychain positively. Another aspect is that prices of ASICs can be higher the more valuable virtual currency is. Harmonychain should therefore also see a positive impact on stock price for that reason.

*Disclaimer:*

This is my own consideration of Harmonychain and why this case could be a 10 to 100 gainer. The company is priced extremely low when considering my own simplistic EBIT estimates for the future. But be aware of that there might be errors. If others want to invest, they should also themselves look into this company. I am interested in feedback on my work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzj2gl/harmonychain_analysis/

1,"11/22/2021, 18:14:38",Understand trading signals before you sign up!,VeronicaSale,"**Is there such a thing as real signals?**  
I have worked in multiple companies that provide customers with their buy/sell calls. After years of experience at work and on Reddit, I have noticed a common misconception that most people have. They believe

&gt;that a trading signals company is just a random person sitting behind a computer throwing out random guesses.

**If you believe that you are wrong.**  
When should you be paying for a signals company?  
To understand if signals are the right thing for you, answer the following questions.

* Do you have 8 hours a day to spend on research?
* Do you prefer to trust your own experience, knowledge and capabilities rather then tens of employees?
* Do you want to invest responsibly?
* Do you own or would you like to pay for high-quality AI tracking tools?
* Do you understand that you will also be making a guess at the end of the day?

**Is purchasing signals equivalent to flipping a coin?**  
It would depend on the company. It is your responsibility to research the company and determine if you believe in them. It's equivalent to hiring a specialist doctor. Are you positive that the doctor can help? No but statistically he is more likely to be right then you. You definitely shouldn't hire a doctor, if you are sketched out by them. Well,**SUPRISE**,*don't go with a sketchy company either.*  
In reality you are left with 3 options.

1. Spend time researching and then take your own best guess.
2. Go with your gut and pray.
3. Find a reputable trading signals company.

**Do trading signals work?**  
*Honestly,* **yes.**  
Working in a trading signals company means all day you work with the stock market. Not just you but dozens of co-workers. All aiming to create the best service for you, the consumer.**No one can actually predict the stock market,**so they will get the wrong calls. That being said some**do better then others.**  
How can you be sure that it is a safe bet?  
If you finda signal company that looks reputable, but you still want to make sure its a safe investments.  
**Test the service.**You can download the app, and track the free signals. Of course they wont always be right.  
**Give it enough time so you get a proper ratio that you are confident in.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzib1g/understand_trading_signals_before_you_sign_up/

Make a list of all the stonks currently on the news. and then put that shit in front of your younger sibling, or cousin, or just someone you know for sure is underdeveloped, doesnt necessarily need to be younger but has to be a guaranteed retard for you to make guaranteed returns. that is how it works. now explain to them the situation, and tell that your future is in their hands. Make them really concentrate on the task at hand, Now ask them to say out loud one of the tickers in that list and afterwards bring up a chart of the ticker on your phone and ask them how the line in the chart will move next. depending on that YOLO everything on weekly otm options on the ticker.

1. Gambling is zero sum game but, in stock market you invest money in an asset to get better returns on it's price appreciation.
2. Gambling is a game of chance and luck but, trading and investing in stock market is a skill.
3. Gambling can be done anytime but to trade or invest in stock market you have to wait for a better price.

The big boys and defense contractors have lots of legacy nonsense which opens up another avenue to get in the game.

I really like $ASTR and what they're planning to do over the next four years - they could be one of first players for approachable orbital vehicles and exploration - being the conduit for middle sized companies to get satellites into orbit.  Their successful launch this weekend will certainly be a strong catalyst for this week and moving forward.

That being said - who else do you like in this space?  Which companies will we look back at in 2030-2040 and say - if I had played that right I could have turned $10k into $10m?

I remember every few months some retard would hatch an idea to buy a low market cap company with the power of many retards. I think at the time wsb had like 200-500 thousand members. While it seemed funny and unlikely I think the $GME apes might actually be doing it. 

$GME the meme stock that made our beloved community explode, I truly believe might pull off what should be nearly impossible, and that is purchase the entire float of a company and direct register those shares.  

Now if you havent seen dont f with cats on Netflix, watch how the internet community with little to no info (to the untrained/non autistic eye) can catch the bad guy. The only way it would be possible to purchase the entire float with one small community is if the short interest was ridiculously high. This is the essence of the play. 

I cannot brigade but a handful of subs have a bot tracking Reddit members shares. According to this bot and some other data points roughly 1/3 of the shares have already been direct registered. 

Personally I am interested to see how this all plays out more then the gains/losses to be made.

Zim is a public Israeli cargo shipping company. It has a 0.45% market share with a p/e of 2. It has a p/fcf ratio of 3. The shipping industry has increased production by 600% over the last year and is continuing to have insanely high demand. The industry has a current TAM of $1.5 trillion and is expected to grow 50% over the next 2 years. This stock has rallied a bit after earnings but jts still not too late to buy. They also have announced a 17% dividend on Dec 15. With an ROE of 215% this shit is making me horny. They also have Gross margins of 57%. And an inventory turnover of almost 50X. They have a current ratio of 1.8 meaning they r very liquid. The average days outstanding for inventory is a close to 8 meaning that they're shit sells fast. They have a total debt / ebitda ratio of 0.6 meaning they have very little debt. 

THESIS

The shipping industry had obviously suffered over the course of the pandemic and had rebounded sharply, however the prices recently have been getting higher than snoop dogg. So it is a good inflation hedge and there r still some countries that haven't opened up they're ports yet for trade. We also have supply chain issues, once they get sorted out ( as they r rn) this stonk will be an absolute fucking tendie printer.

I wanted to share this trade to you in hopes that ~~you'll pump up my IV~~ I can finally give back to this community.

Marathon Digital ($MARA) is a company that mines commodities. It is very profitable. I won't bore you with the details, but the important thing is the volatility. Let's take a look at it:

[Historical and Implied Volaitility for MARA \(Marathon Digital Holdings\)](https://preview.redd.it/v3dyredn82181.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8df28134d206cb24461838abe34b8fc6abfcfe92)

If you look at the historical volatility for $MARA, it's on an uptrend, but it is unusually low right now given the rise in the commodity they mine. I believe that both the share price, as well as the IV, will rise in the coming months. Given the IV from the rally earlier this year, let's say that 250% is not unreasonable to expect. Let's take a look at what that would do for those holding calendar spreads. I like to use OptionStrat. Here's my trade with the current IV ([https://optionstrat.com/build/calendar-call-spread/MARA/-220218C125@2.54,220318C125@3.60](https://optionstrat.com/build/calendar-call-spread/MARA/-220218C125@2.54,220318C125@3.60)):

And here's what it would look like if IV pumps to 250%:

Where we can see, even a modest 100% gain in the share price (not unlikely given the past performance) would net a 21x return, and a little bit higher prices would give you that 25 bagger you've always dreamed about.

My position is 100x Feb/Mar 125c calendar spreads. It also happens to be a YOLO!

Disclaimer: This isn't financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

The hedgies hate this trick! This proven trick is known to secure a green portfolio and has reversed blown up accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMERICAN AIRLINES $AAL:**

There's no hidden trick with American Airlines. The tendies are endless and has shown to to give 100-200% gainers on the way up from $19. What's the catch? Not a whole lot. But remember, you're catching them tendies on the way down as well. The boarding has just begun. If it reverses up from here we made a higher low following Sept13 and Oct27 bounces.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Pros:**

\- At support.

\- 15% shorted float can cause a nice squeeze up with solid volume. \**Per finviz\**

\- Pretty consistent trend, the chart below is the 3hour chart. The daily is more convincing but got a position on the bottom curl. This trend goes out to about July and now we're heading towards peak holiday travel.

\- Options are relatively cheap, an example being DEC 31, $19 CALL, ITM is $1.20. If you want to play it safe you can get it further out for not much more.

**The Cons:**

**-** Flight cancelations

\- Austria lockdown over COVID could cause our play to get grounded if fear spreads.

\- Fuel prices

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm also pretty adhd so I tend to ramble and get specific details wrong. Anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, with the recent addition of Mr Verma - looking at his old employer Exela, they have recently had a frenzy of sec filings that (to my eyes) seem odd, as they offer a buyback, remove the offer, change terms, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The latest one (as of friday) I believe still had Mr. Verma's name attached despite being in affect after his departure. 

&amp;#x200B;

The buyback is in relation to some 'senior secured notes' from subsidiaries of exela. The companies on the original filing are semi ambiguous, to me looking like basically shell companies.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the odds this is in anyway retail to microvision? Is my tinfoil too tight?

Edit: What Are Shell Corporations Used For?

&amp;#x200B;

Shell corporations can serve several purposes:

&amp;#x200B;

Real estate: Some business partnerships establish shell corporations for the purpose of real estate acquisition. This is particularly true in foreign markets, where local buyers may enjoy tax advantages.

&amp;#x200B;

Holding intellectual property: Production companies use shell corporations as a way of owning intellectual property and shielding it from lawsuits or other forms of seizure.

&amp;#x200B;

Hostile takeovers: A group of investors attempting a hostile takeover of a public company may set up a shell corporation to take ownership of the company should the hostile takeover succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

Reverse mergers: Some private companies use shell corporations to go public using a technique called a reverse merger, which is swifter and less expensive than a typical IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

Tax avoidance: A great number of shell corporations set up in foreign countries exist in order to shield their owners from local tax liabilities.

So wtf does exela do? They are no longer a shell company, after a multi company merger worth billions from a bunch of companies that sound like shell companies, many related to anubhav verma, such as exela, hands on global management, sourceHOV, and another company, novitex.

**$MARA  Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. Stock Analysis:**

MARA has gone through the ringer over the past couple of weeks caused by a series of unfortunate events. Firstly, on November 10th, 2021, MARA reported their Q3 2021 earnings report in which they beat their earnings estimate, but missed on revenue, however with revenue rising 6,000% YoY (for Q3), surely MARA would go up right? Wrong. MARA dipped on this earnings (about 14%) which was objectively the least of investors concerns after the next couple of events to unfold. 5 days after their earnings, MARA announced that they were being investigated by the SEC for securities law violations. This news (combined with the news of a $500M debt offering) caused MARA to drop by 27%, which was by far the largest drop/worry for investors. Lastly, to top it all off, the next day MARA reported that they increased their debt offering to $650M (from $500M), causing the stock to dip another 8% to put the cherry on top of an awful week.

This article seeks to find whether MARA is a good buy after their -28% week, or if they are still overvalued and could continue falling.

**MARA Company Overview:**

Marathon Digital Holdings is a mining company that was founded in 2010 and headquartered in Las Vegas. As of Q3 2021, MARA had 25,272 miners installed and mining , and 4,000 additional miners being shipped and awaiting installment. Furthermore, MARA has purchase agreements with Bitmain to purchase over 100,000 more miners and install them by January 2022.

**MARA Investment Information:**

*Shares Outstanding Historical Growth:*

MARA has increased their shares outstanding by a CAGR of 160% over the last 4 years. This is arguably the highest CAGR in shares outstanding that I have ever seen and is heavily influenced by their share offerings in 2020, which increased the shares outstanding by a factor of 7x within 1 year. However, since the Q1 2021 report, MARA has only increased their shares outstanding by approximately 4%. This desire to maintain their current level of shares outstanding can be exhibited through their recent offering, in which they financed using debt instead of equity (which they have not opted for historically). I think that MARA is going to severely decline their share offerings, and I believe that share dilution is not currently worrisome for MARA investors, however it should be kept in the back of your mind and paid attention to.

*$650M Debt Offering:*

As previously mentioned, MARA had a $650M debt offering on November 17th 2021, which played a major role in their 28% decline. However, was this reaction warranted? Or was it an overreaction? Lets find out.

MARA announced that they would be issuing $650M worth of 1% convertible senior notes due December 1st, 2026. MARA was able to secure this funding by offering interest of 1% which is very low for a company that does not have a published S&amp;P Credit Score. However, the big opportunity here lies in the convertibility of these notes. These notes will be convertible as early as June 1st, 2026, in which holders can convert their notes into 13.13 shares for every $1,000 worth of bonds that they hold. The math works out to roughly 1 share for every $76 they invested in notes. This was roughly the price of their stock before it dropped 28%. However, if there are large movements in their stock, MARA has the right (under certain circumstances) to change the conversion rate of these notes.

MARA intends to use the proceeds of this offering to acquire mining machines. Based off of their previous purchases it is safe to assume that MARA will be using part of these proceeds to purchase ASIC Antminer S-19j miners (given that their big orders have been these models of miners historically). Given that the current price for one of these miners is $12,000, given current price of $60,000 USD, each of these machines is expected to breakeven in 1 year (after housing and electricity each machine should yield $12,630/year (USD)). However, MARA has historically been able to obtain a 6% discount due to high volume orders, bringing their price per miner to approximately $11,250. In their recent Q3 2021 investor presentation they estimated the return on invested capital is 109% annually, which matches up with the figures I found. Considering this return on invested capital (when purchasing miners), this offering should be beneficial for investors in the long run. Especially if you load up at current prices or after this bull run is over.

*Environmental Social and Governance:*

Mining has been heavily criticized by the public, the media, and large public figures like Elon Musk for consuming large amounts of electricity, thereby polluting the environment. This is a problem that few miners have addressed, however, MARA has pledged to becoming 70% carbon neutral by Q1 2022, and 100% carbon neutral by Q1 2023.

They have not laid out a plan on how they intend to do this, and there is not one that I can find online, so time will tell. However, I believe this to be in their best interest to attract more institutional investors, and more conscious retail investors as well.

*Institutional Investors:*

Marathon Digital has piqued the interest of many institutional investors as of late. Currently they have 10 institutional investors, with the likes of Vanguard, and Blackrock having large stakes (8.8%, and 5.8% respectively). Furthermore, in their Q3 institutional investors disclosure, they reported 8 of their 10 institutional holders increased their position sizes, notably Goldman Sachs increased their position size by over 600%, and Charles Schwab increased their position size by 188%. Furthermore, there were only 2 holders that decreased their position sizes, who were Northern Trust (decreased by 2.3%), and BlackRock (who decreased their position size by 2.1%).

*HODLing:*

Ever since the start of the bull run around January of 2021, MARA has been increasing the % of mined that they are holding. In January of 2021, MARA held 3.5% of their mined coins, however, as of October 2021, MARA is holding 35% of their minings. Currently, MARA is holding 7,453 coins which equates to roughly $450M USD of liquid.

*Expansion and Growth Plans:*

Between now and mid-2022, MARA plans to have all of their 133,000 ordered miners deployed and running, which should increase their generating capacity by almost 400%. I do not believe that this includes the miners that are going to be purchased as a result of their debt offering, however it is unclear, and I am hoping that they will announce more details on where they spent the proceeds of this debt offering soon. MARA plans to get all of these miners up and running by mid-2022, as they are going to start to charter their own flights to ensure that they can receive these miners in a timely manner. Furthermore, I believe that MARA has already reached an agreement with a facility to enable them to run these additional 100,000 miners for ($0.50/miner per day) $18.25M/year. However, given their current profitability these miners should drive in $1.26B in revenue/year.

**Investment Valuation:**

The only way in which I was able to value MARA was through a comparable companies analysis. This is due to the fact that MARA is not yet profitable, and they do not offer a dividend.

*P/B Ratio:*

By comparing MARAs P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found their fair value to be $45/share, which would imply a price reduction of 18%.

*EV/Assets Multiple:*

By comparing MARAs EV/Assets multiple to that of their public competition, I found MARAs fair value to be $38.50/share, which implies a downside risk of 30%.

*D/E Ratio:*

Lastly, by comparing MARAs D/E ratio, I found their fair value to be $820/share, which implies an increase of 1400%.

*Final Valuation:*

As you can probably tell, MARAs comparable ratios and multiples are vastly different from each other, which makes it difficult to value them. In order to value MARA, I decided to take a weighted average result of the 3 comparable metrics, giving weights of 45%, 45%, and 5% to the P/B, EV/Assets, and D/E Ratios respectively. By doing this I was able to arrive at a valuation of $80.58/share, which implies a 47.4% upside.

**Overall Thoughts:**

I think that MARA is overvalued relative to their peers in the industry, as the only reason for their comparable valuation of $80/share is due to the D/E ration implying a 1400% gain. However, personally I am bullish on the short-term prospect of MARA . Furthermore, I would be looking to slowly accumulate more MARA after this bull run is over to get in at a low price and hold for the next 4 years until the next halving and bull run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qz9x35/mara_is_expanding_quickly_80_pt/

**$MARA  Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. Stock Analysis:**

MARA has gone through the ringer over the past couple of weeks caused by a series of unfortunate events. Firstly, on November 10th, 2021, MARA reported their Q3 2021 earnings report in which they beat their earnings estimate, but missed on revenue, however with revenue rising 6,000% YoY (for Q3), surely MARA would go up right? Wrong. MARA dipped on this earnings (about 14%) which was objectively the least of investors concerns after the next couple of events to unfold. 5 days after their earnings, MARA announced that they were being investigated by the SEC for securities law violations. This news (combined with the news of a $500M debt offering) caused MARA to drop by 27%, which was by far the largest drop/worry for investors. Lastly, to top it all off, the next day MARA reported that they increased their debt offering to $650M (from $500M), causing the stock to dip another 8% to put the cherry on top of an awful week.

This article seeks to find whether MARA is a good buy after their -28% week, or if they are still overvalued and could continue falling.

**MARA Company Overview:**

Marathon Digital Holdings is a mining company that was founded in 2010 and headquartered in Las Vegas. As of Q3 2021, MARA had 25,272 miners installed and mining , and 4,000 additional miners being shipped and awaiting installment. Furthermore, MARA has purchase agreements with Bitmain to purchase over 100,000 more miners and install them by January 2022.

**MARA Investment Information:**

*Shares Outstanding Historical Growth:*

MARA has increased their shares outstanding by a CAGR of 160% over the last 4 years. This is arguably the highest CAGR in shares outstanding that I have ever seen and is heavily influenced by their share offerings in 2020, which increased the shares outstanding by a factor of 7x within 1 year. However, since the Q1 2021 report, MARA has only increased their shares outstanding by approximately 4%. This desire to maintain their current level of shares outstanding can be exhibited through their recent offering, in which they financed using debt instead of equity (which they have not opted for historically). I think that MARA is going to severely decline their share offerings, and I believe that share dilution is not currently worrisome for MARA investors, however it should be kept in the back of your mind and paid attention to.

*$650M Debt Offering:*

As previously mentioned, MARA had a $650M debt offering on November 17th 2021, which played a major role in their 28% decline. However, was this reaction warranted? Or was it an overreaction? Lets find out.

MARA announced that they would be issuing $650M worth of 1% convertible senior notes due December 1st, 2026. MARA was able to secure this funding by offering interest of 1% which is very low for a company that does not have a published S&amp;P Credit Score. However, the big opportunity here lies in the convertibility of these notes. These notes will be convertible as early as June 1st, 2026, in which holders can convert their notes into 13.13 shares for every $1,000 worth of bonds that they hold. The math works out to roughly 1 share for every $76 they invested in notes. This was roughly the price of their stock before it dropped 28%. However, if there are large movements in their stock, MARA has the right (under certain circumstances) to change the conversion rate of these notes.

MARA intends to use the proceeds of this offering to acquire mining machines. Based off of their previous purchases it is safe to assume that MARA will be using part of these proceeds to purchase ASIC Antminer S-19j miners (given that their big orders have been these models of miners historically). Given that the current price for one of these miners is $12,000, given current price of $60,000 USD, each of these machines is expected to breakeven in 1 year (after housing and electricity each machine should yield $12,630/year (USD)). However, MARA has historically been able to obtain a 6% discount due to high volume orders, bringing their price per miner to approximately $11,250. In their recent Q3 2021 investor presentation they estimated the return on invested capital is 109% annually, which matches up with the figures I found. Considering this return on invested capital (when purchasing miners), this offering should be beneficial for investors in the long run. Especially if you load up at current prices or after this bull run is over.

*ESG:*

Mining has been heavily criticized by the public, the media, and large public figures like Elon Musk for consuming large amounts of electricity, thereby polluting the environment. This is a problem that few miners have addressed, however, MARA has pledged to becoming 70% carbon neutral by Q1 2022, and 100% carbon neutral by Q1 2023.

They have not laid out a plan on how they intend to do this, and there is not one that I can find online, so time will tell. However, I believe this to be in their best interest to attract more institutional investors, and more ESG conscious retail investors as well.

*Institutional Investors:*

Marathon Digital has piqued the interest of many institutional investors as of late. Currently they have 10 institutional investors, with the likes of Vanguard, and Blackrock having large stakes (8.8%, and 5.8% respectively). Furthermore, in their Q3 institutional investors disclosure, they reported 8 of their 10 institutional holders increased their position sizes, notably Goldman Sachs increased their position size by over 600%, and Charles Schwab increased their position size by 188%. Furthermore, there were only 2 holders that decreased their position sizes, who were Northern Trust (decreased by 2.3%), and BlackRock (who decreased their position size by 2.1%).

*HODLing:*

Ever since the start of the bull run around January of 2021, MARA has been increasing the % of mined that they are holding. In January of 2021, MARA held 3.5% of their mined coins, however, as of October 2021, MARA is holding 35% of their minings. Currently, MARA is holding 7,453 coins which equates to roughly $450M USD of liquid.

*Expansion and Growth Plans:*

Between now and mid-2022, MARA plans to have all of their 133,000 ordered miners deployed and running, which should increase their generating capacity by almost 400%. I do not believe that this includes the miners that are going to be purchased as a result of their debt offering, however it is unclear, and I am hoping that they will announce more details on where they spent the proceeds of this debt offering soon. MARA plans to get all of these miners up and running by mid-2022, as they are going to start to charter their own flights to ensure that they can receive these miners in a timely manner. Furthermore, I believe that MARA has already reached an agreement with a facility to enable them to run these additional 100,000 miners for ($0.50/miner per day) $18.25M/year. However, given their current profitability these miners should drive in $1.26B in revenue/year.

**Investment Valuation:**

The only way in which I was able to value MARA was through a comparable companies analysis. This is due to the fact that MARA is not yet profitable, and they do not offer a dividend.

*P/B Ratio:*

By comparing MARAs P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found their fair value to be $45/share, which would imply a price reduction of 18%.

*EV/Assets Multiple:*

By comparing MARAs EV/Assets multiple to that of their public competition, I found MARAs fair value to be $38.50/share, which implies a downside risk of 30%.

*D/E Ratio:*

Lastly, by comparing MARAs D/E ratio, I found their fair value to be $820/share, which implies an increase of 1400%.

*Final Valuation:*

As you can probably tell, MARAs comparable ratios and multiples are vastly different from each other, which makes it difficult to value them. In order to value MARA, I decided to take a weighted average result of the 3 comparable metrics, giving weights of 45%, 45%, and 5% to the P/B, EV/Assets, and D/E Ratios respectively. By doing this I was able to arrive at a valuation of $80.58/share, which implies a 47.4% upside.

**Overall Thoughts:**

I think that MARA is overvalued relative to their peers in the industry, as the only reason for their comparable valuation of $80/share is due to the D/E ration implying a 1400% gain. However, personally I am bullish on the short-term prospect of MARA . Furthermore, I would be looking to slowly accumulate more MARA after this bull run is over to get in at a low price and hold for the next 4 years until the next halving and bull run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qz9shh/mara_mining_expansion_80_pt/
1,"11/22/2021, 09:33:52",FUBO coiled for   ,Greenismyonlycolor,"Bullish case for FUBO
    FUBO has a low market cap of around 3B today.  I expect it to do more revenue it 2023 than that low 3B alone, and growth will continue to be high and drive it much further in the future. 
     After being in a relatively steady zone, FUBO stock  looked poised to break out just before earnings, but sold off and fell 40% after a tremendous earnings report.   We know short interest has remained high at around 20% of the float, and the stock price has certainly fluctuated in this manner before.  However, this is the a rare chance to pick up a stock that will eventually 10-15X in a short period of time.  
     For starters, their growth rate is insane.  The number of customer acquisitions are growing so fast estimates have risen 4 times this year.  They now have about 1.1 million customers.  To put that in perspective, they had roughly 300,000 users going into Q3 of last year.  Thats over a 300% growth looking at that short time period.  This high growth rate resulted in revenue growing 156% YoY. Keep in mind that there are still almost 80 million households with traditional cable.  It is estimated that 50 million of them will cut of cable for an alternate TV package in the next five years.  Over the last 18 months, FUBO has increased its market share In acquiring these customers faster than any competitor, including Sling and YouTubeTV.  Conservatively, FUBO will get 20% of these 50 million customers as they are already hitting that marker.  This would be a growth of over 1000% from Oct 2021 to 2026  But that 20% is low in my opinion, and they will most likely continue to increase their pie in this category, and could easily get 33% of future cord cutters. This alone would add around 15 million net users in the next 5 years.  Another thing that separates FUBO from traditional cable is availability.  With traditional cable, you have to live in an area with a cable service, and some people that live in rural or undeveloped  areas will not have access to a Comcast or Verizon choice but would be able to get FUBO.  As FUBO continues to become a recognized name, it will take market share from satellite companies that have a worse service.  Additionally, FUBO is a superior service to people who move or travel a lot, as they always immediately have access to the full service and can watch FUBO on any streaming device without needing Cable Boxes, a satellite, or being at their installed location to get a TV service like Cox or Comcast.  This would add to more customers not in the cable cutter area, and at a minimum, expect another 1 million subscribers here.

Not only are the customers growing for FUBO, but the QUALITY of one user is much more meaningful for FUBO than when compared to Netflix, Disney, DraftKings, etc.  
The average revenue per user for stand alone streaming services is small, normally between $10-14.  For FUBO, it was $69 last quarter, or about 500% higher and is growing at a higher rate than that of its peers.  The number of hours people watch FUBO is higher than any streaming service that exists, giving it the opportunity to generate more advertising revenue than its competitors.  The reason its higher is because it focuses on live sports, which captures the users attention for a few hours at a time rather than traditional television shows.   

FUBO is getting into creating their own content centered around sports analysis and discussion. I expect that as their sports betting service takes off, more original content will be developed for this as well.  With sports betting, FUBO has one huge advantage that hasnt really been discussed.  Sports betting has an extremely high customer acquisition cost, which is why you see all of the advertising of TV and everywhere else.  DG estimated it to be around $800.  For FUBO, their customer acquisition costs is much closer to $0 than $800, as the customers they are attracting are already paying subscribers.  
The technology FUBO uses for its service is light years ahead of its peers.  For those who havent seen its ability to connect with your smart phone, its a  really feature and allows your phone to be more engaged with your TV than just acting like a remote as it can give live betting options and stats and syncs with your TV to change as you change the game.  Another nice feature is Fanview, which gives the user to see sports stats while they are watching the game. They also offer several games for free in 4K quality, something its competitors do not.  These great sports features will help it capture sports betting market share.  I expect it to capture a portion of the sports betting frenzy, which will add revenue to its bottom line in the hundreds of millions.

Im here to tell you tards why Embark is the holy grail in autonomous vehicles. EMBK will make $AUR look like a peanuts when it moons.


This literally cannot go tits up. Heres my top 9 reasons why EMBK will dominate the AV truck space:


**1. Over 14,000 pre-orders. Partnerships with [DHL](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211028005341/en/DHL-Supply-Chain-Partners-with-Autonomous-Software-Leader-Embark-to-Deploy-Fleet-Starting-in-2024), Knight-Swift, Anheuser Busch, HP.**

Nuff said. Embarks partners have 35,000 trucks and $23 billion in freight costs. [14,200 reservations](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005339/en/Embark-Opens-Reservations-to-Partner-Development-Program-Carriers-Ahead-of-2024-Commercial-Launch-Securing-14200-Reservations).
    

More partnerships with trucking companies [on their website](https://www.embarktrucks.com).


**2. AV + EV =  Embark is already building for EV trucks. Nikola/Tesla potential??**    


Story [here](https://dot.la/embark-hp-2655057988.html). Name two more hyped technologies. Go ahead, I dare you.
    

**3. $700 billion upside. projections are big but even if Embark only captures a fraction of the market, it will be posting multibillion dollar revenues** 

Info on [slide 27-28.](https://investors.embarktrucks.com/static-files/b0a555e2-969e-4f16-8bb3-9f47e0335d97)


**4. Backed by Sequoia Capital, Knight-Swift, and Tiger Capital**

All 3 are investors. Full list of investors on [slide 21.](https://investors.embarktrucks.com/static-files/8db681b8-4ea3-452f-a3e6-3a151d8866d9). 

**5. Extreme Meme Potential. The $IONQ of AV.**

Low float de SPAC. CEO is 26 years old. His name is literally [A-Rod](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/embark-ceo-alex-rodrigues-taking-driverless-truck-firm-public-via-spac.html). Trumps [transportation secretary](https://fortune.com/2021/06/23/former-department-of-transportation-secretary-elaine-chao-returns-to-the-private-sector/) is on the board of directors. 

**6. No China connection.**

Unlike TuSimple and Plus, Embark is all-American. TuSimple might go the way of Didi: theyre still [being investigated](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tusimple-discloses-specifics-of-federal-ownership-probe) by the feds.


**7. Riding the $AUR wave.**
$AUR is already mooning. $EMBK is where $AUR was a week ago, and its on the same track. Get in now.

**8. Massive discount compared to competitors**

Embark was valued at $5 billion when it IPOd. Compare that to $AUR ($13 billion) and Waymo ($$$$$$$). Warrants are especially cheap right now and the stock has dipped. Ready for takeoff


**9. Still dont believe me? Check out [their own deck](https://investors.embarktrucks.com/static-files/bc1ae046-b9d4-48a7-9cb7-63f7e6cf54f5) on why they will moon.**

Closed below $4 last week and is heavily shorted. I did some research on them and their Austin TX operation since i live here. I found the office they are building and the original announcement back in the summer of 2020. 

[https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/08/05/hippo-leases-downtown-austin-office-building.html#:\~:text=Hippo's%20new%20downtown%20office%20space,Fifth%20St](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/08/05/hippo-leases-downtown-austin-office-building.html#:~:text=Hippo's%20new%20downtown%20office%20space,Fifth%20St).

Insuretech has been a risky investment and the SPAC market was the SPAC market. After the merger and two earnings calls, there is enough public information to convince me that this stock is about to get a lot of buyers, and hopefully squeezes out the shorts. 

I cant post the link to the Jeffries here. 

Furthermore, $HIPO went public via a SPAC created by tech bemothos like Reed Hastings of Paypal, Linkedin. I do not think i am smarter than those guys, so i am willing to bet that they knew they were bringing a legitimate business with gigantic upside. Contrary to its valuation, $LMND their only real competitor is losing marketshare to this new company because of their human-controlled insurance claims process. Lemonade boasts its artificial intelligence makes insurance claims faster and cheaper but their recent loss ratio says otherwise. Take a look at the recent hiring at Hippo and the leadership, this company is not going to zero and is more likely to be eating marketshare from every other insurance company nationwide. 

I dont have the Ortex data to share but to offer something unique i rode my bike around downtown in the area where the new Hippo building is supposed to be and i found it! Their market value going public double what it has been reduced to, i was waiting for a positive catalyst like the target price by a respected institution. This does not look like a company that is trying to be bought out, rather here to compete with the major insurance companies that cannot pivot as quickly as  a tech-based startup. There is plenty about the CEO and company online to research that i didnt post here.

ocugen has no shortage of backers &amp; shorts &amp; OCGN is up &gt; 4,000% in the past year. what does future hold for Covaxin in the US &amp; Canada? NIH director helps you narrow it down. easy doubler. wouldn't be a first

[no big deal, just the NIH director &amp; lancet study](https://preview.redd.it/ktgtmte331181.jpg?width=1742&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48dbccf33a1d7638fbd38c6f6bdad853df5f3cc)

ironically, despite all of the news flow &amp; publication of covaxin phase 3 trial data revealing strong efficacy, &amp; eua granted to covaxin by indian government, ocugen's fortunes are in a similar place to where they were before who approval

earlier this week, ocugen reported q3 financials. as the clinical stage biopharma company has no product to sell, i be much eager to glean insights on two subjects: balance sheet &amp; the progress of drug pipeline, specifically in ocugens case, path forward for its vaccine covaxin which it has licensed exclusive rights in us &amp; canada from bharat bio

$107m in cash. enough to keep operations going into 2023. 11/18 announces inducement grants for 6 new employees (hmmm)

covaxin  a who approved vaccine which has proven to be much more effective than mrna products which require constant booster shots subscriptions because big dick pharma decided that subscription model yields much higher profits. has benefits that other vaccines do not, such ability to induce a th1 response, conferring cell-mediated immunity &amp; offering durable &amp; enhanced protection against delta variants, which is the primary concern at the present time

I think it's possible that us would not object to stockpiling some covaxin, which has a differentiated mechanism of action, &amp; a shelf life of up to years. to summarise the current state of affairs, i would lean toward an approval in canada  if covaxin is good enough for the who, why would it not be good enough for canada? 

ocugen holds the rights to distribute covaxin in the us on behalf of bharat, &amp; a 45% share of all profits. it also has a similar deal in place for canada, standing to earn 55% of all profits. the study conducted under the ind, will help demonstrate that the data from india will be applicable to the us population. ocugen has already sought regulatory approval from health canada for covaxin to be used in that country

to this end, the 5-star h.c. wainwright analyst ramakanth swayampakula has a buy rating for $ocgn shares, backed by a $10 price target. ramakanth senses theres an opportunity for the vaccine to make its mark

*Processing img lyp613ih31181...*

bb can't fill &amp; hasn't filled the orders in their 1.3b population of india. they are behind &amp; that was before india approved covaxin for 2-9 year olds (before) who approval, had orders from over 15 countries, mounting close to 1b orders unfilled. uses the platform of polio vaccines i.e. proven the safest

ocugen will rip over highs (again) once orders start pouring in. I see $18 on first revenue source

ocugen announced eua for covaxin for pediatric patients 2-18 yrs old, supported by a phase 2/3 pediatric study in india. results from the study of 526 children display similar outcome to phase 3 study (in adult study, covaxin showed 77.8% efficacy &amp; 93.4% efficacy rate against severe disease

there has been a spurt in global interest in covaxin for pediatric use. clinical data from 2-18 age group has also been well received by several countries. only covaxin has such data in covid vaccines for such age group. several countries are now mulling import of covaxin for their paediatric populations

the neutralizing antibody responses against wild-type strain in the pediatric age group of 2-18 years were equivalent to those seen in adults, ages 18+ years, in bharat biotechs large phase 3 efficacy &amp; safety trial. the inactivated virus platform has been used for decades in vaccines for the pediatric population

meanwhile, ocugen entered into an agreement with cansino over gene therapy product candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration 

now, did you want to talk about ocugen healing the many mutations that cause blindness all at once on the harvard platform? hell nay, these hit writers for the bears don't tell you about that. yep, it's going to human trials now to heal the blind, meaning they can probably start selling for healing blind animals now &amp; if successful in human trials, this is the next potential $50b company

ocugen is guilty of many parabolic moves. 4000% gains got praise from analysts who have watched as the under-the-radar biotech company focusing on developing gene therapies targeting eye disease partnered with bharat biotech that had already won authorization for its covid-19 vaccine covaxin in india. bharat wanted a partner to help get covaxin into the u.s. market. it picked ocugen

lolz at mms using dark pool to buy &amp; the market to sell into retail thinking they smart using ladder attacks &amp; give illusion of a steep sell off. with on chain data easy to tell they accumulating whole time some news comes out. buy the rumor sell the news. they want you to once again sit out the next 12 months like you did the last 12 months missing out on 4000% gains. do your own dd &amp; don't listen to bearish hit writers trying to get retailers to sell so tutes can buy them out

upcoming  canada day, betches. it's going to be a glorious weekend. a former monster showing strength again on volume spikes. uptrending into an ascending wedge that could easily squeeze through the $15 level next week

prepare for fire works. bb will announce orders, ocugen will produce 50% of those orders. canada &amp; US still in play. hodl or watch for dip entrance or next volume resistance break on hourly chart. start out 1/4 of your position &amp; have fun making money. easy doubler. wouldn't be a first",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qz6tnl/g_spot_ocgn_back_in_play_canada_day/

1,"11/22/2021, 06:49:23",Harmonychain analysis (ISIN NO0010921299),Fit_Shelter2581,"Was listed on Euronext Growth Oslo, in May 2021. First day it was traded in the range 1,77 to 2.40 NOK pr stock. In March 2021 the company Issued 61 million stocks to market for 1.80 NOK pr stock (approx. 0,20 $ per stock). Total number of stocks in Harmonychain is 173 million. This amounts to an issue a bit above 12 mill $ and a marketcap close to 35 mill $. The company still has 10 mill $ of this issued capital in cash. There are no issues with liquidity.

*Arctic Core:*

Harmonychain AS, owns 100% two companies. Artic Core AS and Lokotech AS. Artic Core is a Norwegian datacenter company, building up multiple datasenters powered by hydropower in remote locations in Norway. This to both ensure that blockchain validation is run off eco friendly power, but also to take advantage of cheap electricity prices in the more rural regions of Norway. Prices in north of Norway is in average 1/10th as prices in Texas US (a well know mining location). But there are also other large advantages, 98% of all produced power in Norway is hydropower, and temperature outside Norway is naturally very low which makes operation cheaper and effective than compared to 45 degC in US Texas. Norway is also deemed to be one of the more political stable countries in the world which also are attractive for many customers. The integrity of the electric power grid is also deemed to be high. Power outages virtually never happens. All this stack up to be some of the most attractive mining business plans on the planet. With latest generation of hardware 70 to 250 $/MWh is expected revenue generation. In Norway, all the mentioned factors is not only maximizing profitability by delivering very low operations cost (cooling and power) but also by being ecofriendly (Eco Blockchains). Cost of running a 1 MWh mining (effieicnet farm) could be as much as 125 $/kWh to150 $/MWh (12 cent pr kWh). Some of the larger farms in Texas get lower power prices by signing agreements to shut down mining rigs as soon as they are asked to from grid company. Power prices can be as low as 4 cent in these agreements. This does however impact efficiency and revenue and will of course reduce profitability for that reason as mining equipment is expensive to have on shelf without being in operation. In Northern Norway cost is likely to be no more than 25 $/MWh. In other words where a West Texas farm (24 h operation) with 200 $ revenue/MWh and perhaps 50 $/MWh  75 $/MWh EBITDA/MWh, a northern Norwegian mining farm can have up to 175 $/MWh.

Harmonychain announced that they have developed and launched its own proprietary Scryptpool software in October. This makes them a highly attractive company for Collocated Eco Blockchain validation/mining. They are just about to start full scale operation in the next weeks and months (Halden data cenetr opened 16th Nov). Multiple incoming announcements to the market is also expected on new datacenter locations to the north. Right now, they are ramping up their first datacenter in Halden. Their site has large industrial powerlines with Transformators on site feeding power. It is deemed that this site can deliver 100 MW give or take. Halden is a bit further to the south of Norway which probably increases mining cost to approximately 90 $/MWh. Still, profit can be as high as 110 $/MWh. With 97% operations stability this amounts to an EBITDA of 256 000 $/day or almost 93 million $ pr year. Depreciation over 2 years would turn this into an EBIT of approximately 64 million $ if all equipment is new. This is the Halden datacenter alone. If you just add 1 datacenter (100 MW) in the North (Kautokeino) with operations stability 97% and 175 $/MWh, Artic core would in total have EBITDA that equals 660 000$/day. This is close to 240 million $ per year. Today Harmonychains marketcap is 17 million $.

Harmonychains business model for Arctic Core is however not only to invest and mine krypto for their own revenue stream. They intend also to sell collocated server services and mining pools where harmonychains reward will be Royalty (could be as much as 30% og reward). This basically means that the investments and revenue for Harmonychain in practice will be lower for the two scenarios mentioned above, but EBIT could be much closer to EBITDA as depreciation and invested capital with this model is much lower. Regardless of errors one can imagine in the given estimates, even if EBIT come in at only 50% of 240 million $ per year (which is 120 million $ per year), this holds a massive promise for a company only valuated to 17 million $. Harmonychain with an EBIT or EAT at close to 120 million $ would have an forward P/E of 0,15 the way harmonychain is priced now. I have concluded that norwegian investors are lacking knowledge of the Blockchain industry, and that this is probably the most likely cause of the market not having priced Harmonychain higher. Foreign investors have either not learned to know that harmonychain exist as the company was just listed 6 months back, or are not familiar with the hydropower situation in Norway (check northpool)

*Lokotech::*

The second company Harmonychain owns (100%) is Lokotech. Lokotech is the most known part of Harmonychains business. Lokotech has developed a design and a circuit model for an Scrypt ASIC (supercomputer specifically developed to mine c-coins) which they call the Bulldozer. This ASIC has 4 times as efficient hash/Joule rate as the latest Bitmain ASIC for Scrypt mining (the L7). This has raised many eyebrows. Bitmain is a massive Chinese company valuated to more than 100 Billion $. How likely is it that a 17 million $ challenger from Norway can win against Bitmain on the Scryptcoin market? The design simulations are very promising so fare. CEO recently presented that their chip can do 10 to 15 MHash/Joule which is almost 4 time as energy effective compared to the Bitmains best model that was just launched. But few of Norways old shipping and oil industry investors know what hashrate is. The news of 10 to 15 MH/ Joule have not moved Harmonychains value. Lokotech sends Wafer to production in March. If they pull off this design and production, they estimate that they can sell each Bulldozer ASIC for approximately 10 000 $ per unit. Production cost is likely to be approximately 2000 $. Harmonychain have guided that they want to sell at least 60 000 units pr year. This alone would be a revenue stream of 600 million $ pr year. Harmonychain market cap is 17 mill $.

*Chance of success:*

Arctic Core has very high chance of success. The Scryptpool software is already in alpha testing. The Halden datacenter is already in operation and has by statements of the CEO already mining activity. Due to this it seems like the company have much of the technology and resources to make Arctic Core happen. When it comes to the datacenters to the North there is normal regulation work to be done before these centers can be started. There will always be some risk associated with that. But there are many counties in Northern Norway that are both cold and have extremely low cost/kWh. Its likely that they will get approval for more centers somewhere in the north. There is an ongoing application process in the small town Kautokeino. But it has been mentioned that there are also other initiatives ongoing.

Lokotech AS, are doing hardware engineering of extremely complex nature. Its hard to know if the prototype they will receive after Wafer production in May 2022 will deliver fully as expected. But normally when a world class hardware engineer program and convert code to circuits for chip manufacturing this should work. Its a standard process, that definitely have been done before. There are speculations among Harmonychain investors that the new chip Lokotech is designing is based on FinFet technology as opposed to MosFet. A few thinks this can be the reason for the drastic reduction in power consumption on Lokotechs chip for Scrypt mining. In other words, it could be that they are on to something than can become a success.

*In Summary:*

Both Artic Core and Lokotech has the potential to increase Harmonychains market cap and stock price 10 to 100 times if they have success. Harmonychain is currently priced lower than when listed on Euronext Growth Oslo. The reason for this is most likely due to the krypto crash in May/June as well as Harmonychain announced temporarily in June that they had some trouble with the effectivity of the chip. However, 16th of August Harmonychain announced that they were back on track and this time with even higher MHash/Joule than earlier. But Norwegian investors did not reward Harmonychain with a correction back to previous heights. The stock is still at 50% discount compared to listing price. Company marketcap is 17 mill $, with close to 10 mill $ in cash. Cash burn rate has so fare in 2021 been close to 300 000 $ pr quarter. In summary risk to the low side seem acceptable, while there is an massive upside potential that the market just seem to ignore. This could be due to the typical Norwegian investor know very little about c-coins. This could however be a huge opportunity for investors knowing more about this type of business.

*Triggers:*

* Updates to the market about the progress of Locotechs chip. Manual place and route process which they are in now is expected to deliver even better performance.
* MOU/LOI or contracts on ASIC orders from new customers or collaborators.
* New data center customers to Artic Core
* New data center approvals from government
* Other companies bidding on Harmonychain take over. In December before listed, Harmonychain was offered close to 50% of DLTX. Answer was no, but other larger companies might take interest in Harmonychains technology and try to buy them at this extremely low price.
* Bitc/Altc/Litec/Dogo Rally. It is hard to guess how much c-currency Harmonychain owns right now. But we do know that they have started mining. Its therefore likely that positive development in c-coins o also should impact Harmonychain positively. Another aspect is that prices of ASICs can be higher the more valuable c-coins is. Harmonychain should therefore also see a positive impact on stock price for that reason.

*Disclaimer:*

This is my own consideration of Harmonychain and why this case could be a 10 to 100 gainer. The company is priced extremely low when considering my own simplistic EBIT estimates for the future. But be aware of that there might be errors. If others want to invest, they should also themselves look into this company.

I have concluded that norwegian investors are lacking knowledge of the Blockchain industry, and that this is probably the most likely cause of the market not having priced Harmonychain higher. Foreign investors have either not learned to know that harmonychain exist as the company was just listed 6 months back, or are not familiar with the hydropower situation in Norway (check northpool)

*Lokotech::*

The second company Harmonychain owns (100%) is Lokotech. Lokotech is the most known part of Harmonychains business. Lokotech has developed a design and a circuit model for an Scrypt ASIC (supercomputer specifically developed to mine c-coins) which they call the Bulldozer. This ASIC has 4 times as efficient hash/Joule rate as the latest Bitmain ASIC for Scrypt mining (the L7). This has raised many eyebrows. Bitmain is a massive Chinese company valuated to more than 100 Billion $. How likely is it that a 17 million $ challenger from Norway can win against Bitmain on the Scryptcoin market? The design simulations are very promising so fare. CEO recently presented that their chip can do 10 to 15 MHash/Joule which is almost 4 time as energy effective compared to the Bitmains best model that was just launched. But few of Norways old shipping and oil industry investors know what hashrate is. The news of 10 to 15 MH/ Joule have not moved Harmonychains value. Lokotech sends Wafer to production in March. If they pull off this design and production, they estimate that they can sell each Bulldozer ASIC for approximately 10 000 $ per unit. Production cost is likely to be approximately 2000 $. Harmonychain have guided that they want to sell at least 60 000 units pr year. This alone would be a revenue stream of 600 million $ pr year. Harmonychain market cap is 17 mill $.

*Chance of success:*

Arctic Core has very high chance of success. The Scryptpool software is already in alpha testing. The Halden datacenter is already in operation and has by statements of the CEO already mining activity. Due to this it seems like the company have much of the technology and resources to make Arctic Core happen. When it comes to the datacenters to the North there is normal regulation work to be done before these centers can be started. There will always be some risk associated with that. But there are many counties in Northern Norway that are both cold and have extremely low cost/kWh. Its likely that they will get approval for more centers somewhere in the north. There is an ongoing application process in the small town Kautokeino. But it has been mentioned that there are also other initiatives ongoing.

Lokotech AS, are doing hardware engineering of extremely complex nature. Its hard to know if the prototype they will receive after Wafer production in May 2022 will deliver fully as expected. But normally when a world class hardware engineer program and convert code to circuits for chip manufacturing this should work. Its a standard process, that definitely have been done before. There are speculations among Harmonychain investors that the new chip Lokotech is designing is based on FinFet technology as opposed to MosFet. A few thinks this can be the reason for the drastic reduction in power consumption on Lokotechs chip for Scrypt mining. In other words, it could be that they are on to something than can become a success.

*In Summary:*

Both Artic Core and Lokotech has the potential to increase Harmonychains market cap and stock price 10 to 100 times if they have success. Harmonychain is currently priced lower than when listed on Euronext Growth Oslo. The reason for this is most likely due to the krypto crash in May/June as well as Harmonychain announced temporarily in June that they had some trouble with the effectivity of the chip. However, 16th of August Harmonychain announced that they were back on track and this time with even higher MHash/Joule than earlier. But Norwegian investors did not reward Harmonychain with a correction back to previous heights. The stock is still at 50% discount compared to listing price. Company marketcap is 17 mill $, with close to 10 mill $ in cash. Cash burn rate has so fare in 2021 been close to 300 000 $ pr quarter. In summary risk to the low side seem acceptable, while there is an massive upside potential that the market just seem to ignore. This could be due to the typical Norwegian investor know very little about c-coins. This could however be a huge opportunity for investors knowing more about this type of business.

*Triggers:*

* Updates to the market about the progress of Locotechs chip. Manual place and route process which they are in now is expected to deliver even better performance.
* MOU/LOI or contracts on ASIC orders from new customers or collaborators.
* New data center customers to Artic Core
* New data center approvals from government
* Other companies bidding on Harmonychain take over. In December before listed, Harmonychain was offered close to 50% of DLTX. Answer was no, but other larger companies might take interest in Harmonychains technology and try to buy them at this extremely low price.
* Bitc/Altc/Litec/Dogo Rally. It is hard to guess how much c-currency Harmonychain owns right now. But we do know that they have started mining. Its therefore likely that positive development in c-coins o also should impact Harmonychain positively. Another aspect is that prices of ASICs can be higher the more valuable c-coins is. Harmonychain should therefore also see a positive impact on stock price for that reason.

*Disclaimer:*

This is my own consideration of Harmonychain and why this case could be a 10 to 100 gainer. The company is priced extremely low when considering my own simplistic EBIT estimates for the future. But be aware of that there might be errors. If others want to invest, they should also themselves look into this company.

1,"11/22/2021, 06:41:10","Harmonychain (HMONY, ISIN NO0010921299)",Fit_Shelter2581,"Was listed on Euronext Growth Oslo, in May 2021. First day it was traded in the range 1,77 to 2.40 NOK pr stock. In March 2021 the company Issued 61 million stocks to market for 1.80 NOK pr stock (approx. 0,20 $ per stock). Total number of stocks in Harmonychain is 173 million. This amounts to an issue a bit above 12 mill $ and a marketcap close to 35 mill $. The company still has 10 mill $ of this issued capital in cash. There are no issues with liquidity.

*Arctic Core:*

Harmonychain AS, owns 100% two companies. Artic Core AS and Lokotech AS. Artic Core is a Norwegian datacenter company, building up multiple datasenters powered by hydropower in remote locations in Norway. This to both ensure that blockchain validation is run off eco friendly power, but also to take advantage of cheap electricity prices in the more rural regions of Norway. Prices in north of Norway is in average 1/10th as prices in Texas US (a well know mining location). But there are also other large advantages, 98% of all produced power in Norway is hydropower, and temperature outside Norway is naturally very low which makes operation cheaper and effective than compared to 45 degC in US Texas. Norway is also deemed to be one of the more political stable countries in the world which also are attractive for many customers. The integrity of the electric power grid is also deemed to be high. Power outages virtually never happens.  All this stack up to be some of the most attractive mining business plans on the planet. With latest generation of hardware 70 to 250 $/MWh is expected revenue generation. In Norway, all the mentioned factors is not only maximizing profitability by delivering very low operations cost (cooling and power) but also by being ecofriendly (Eco Blockchains). Cost of running a 1 MWh mining (effieicnet farm) could be as much as 125 $/kWh to150 $/MWh (12 cent pr kWh). Some of the larger farms in Texas get lower power prices by signing agreements to shut down mining rigs as soon as they are asked to from grid company. Power prices can be as low as 4 cent in these agreements. This does however impact efficiency and revenue and will of course reduce profitability for that reason as mining equipment is expensive to have on shelf without being in operation. In Northern Norway cost is likely to be no more than 25 $/MWh. In other words where a West Texas farm (24 h operation) with 200 $ revenue/MWh and perhaps 50 $/MWh  75 $/MWh EBITDA/MWh, a northern Norwegian mining farm can have up to 175 $/MWh.

Harmonychain announced that they have developed and launched its own proprietary Scryptpool software in October. This makes them a highly attractive company for Collocated Eco Blockchain validation/mining. They are just about to start full scale operation in the next weeks and months (Halden data cenetr opened 16th Nov). Multiple incoming announcements to the market is also expected on new datacenter locations to the north. Right now, they are ramping up their first datacenter in Halden. Their site  has large industrial powerlines with Transformators on site feeding power. It is deemed that this site can deliver 100 MW give or take. Halden is a bit further to the south of Norway which probably increases mining cost to approximately 90 $/MWh. Still, profit can be as high as 110 $/MWh. With 97% operations stability this amounts to an EBITDA of 256 000 $/day or almost 93 million $ pr year. Depreciation over 2 years would turn this into an EBIT of approximately 64 million $ if all equipment is new. This is the Halden datacenter alone. If you just add 1 datacenter (100 MW) in the North (Kautokeino) with operations stability 97% and 175 $/MWh, Artic core would in total have EBITDA that equals 660 000$/day. This is close to 240 million $ per year. Today Harmonychains marketcap is 17 million $. 

Harmonychains business model for Arctic Core is however not only to invest and mine krypto for their own revenue stream. They intend also to sell collocated server services and mining pools where harmonychains reward will be Royalty (could be as much as 30% og reward). This basically means that the investments and revenue for Harmonychain in practice will be lower for the two scenarios mentioned above, but EBIT could be much closer to EBITDA as depreciation and invested capital with this model is much lower. Regardless of errors one can imagine in the given estimates, even if EBIT come in at only 50% of 240 million $ per year (which is 120 million $ per year), this holds a massive promise for a company only valuated to 17 million $. Harmonychain with an EBIT or EAT at close to 120 million $ would have an forward P/E of 0,15 the way harmonychain is priced now.

Hey bull gang, hope youre all doing well! Earnings week is slowly winding down, meaning weve got less opportunities to make plays. I believe this will be the last week of the historical post earnings move spreadsheet for the quarter, as next week barely has any companies reporting. I would like to thank you all for checking in with me all throughout the quarter and giving your opinions on my plays! I hope you all managed to make some good money by tagging along.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1memzXUXLqNBD0jy43ImdIiF5joZ7M9NSY6d8ZiCYXIc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isnt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If youre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isnt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1memzXUXLqNBD0jy43ImdIiF5joZ7M9NSY6d8ZiCYXIc/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below Ive compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **$DLTR and $DG provide us with a collateral play opportunity.** $DLTR reports earnings this week, while $DG is set to report next. If Im bullish or bearish on either company, I should look to enter a $DG position BEFORE $DLTR reports since the $DLTR report will move $DG a comparable amount. By playing $DG we can avoid IV crush but still cash in on our gains if were correct. More info on this type of play can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&amp;nbsp;

- **$PDD is inefficiently priced.** You guys already know the drill. At the time of writing, $PDD is priced to move around 10%. Historically $PDD moves 14%. Similar to $FL last week, $PDD reports on Friday, meaning that theta will murder the value of the options, allowing us to get in cheaper than we would normally be able to. Given that volatility doesnt inflate, the options will be pricing a move closer to 8% come Friday, meaning weve got huge edge in this trade. If the numbers are still appealing come Wednesday afternoon (markets are closed Thursday), I will run a long straddle. More information on this type of play can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

I admit I came for the gain/loss porn and to try to fill the role of your wifes boyfriend. I remember every few months some retard would hatch an idea to buy a low market cap company with the power of many retards. I think at the time wsb had like 1-2 million members. While it seemed funny and unlikely I think the $GME apes might actually be doing it. 

$GME the meme stock that made our beloved community explode, I truly believe might pull off what should be nearly impossible, and that is purchase the entire float of a company and direct register those shares.  

Now if you havent seen dont f with cats on Netflix, watch how the internet community with little to no info (to the untrained/non autistic eye) can catch the bad guy. The only way it would be possible to purchase the entire float with one small community is if the short interest was ridiculously high. This is the essence of the play. 

I cannot brigade but a handful of subs have a bot tracking Reddit members shares. According to this bot and some other data points roughly 1/3 of the shares have already been direct registered. 

Personally I am interested to see how this all plays out more then the gains/losses to be made.

BioRestorative Therapies Inc (NASDAQ: BRTX) emerged from bankruptcy on 11/16/20 with the commons intact, it had its up and down in the OTC due to its debts that former CEO of 10 years took, with convertible notes at 50%-60% discount to market that led to declined price, they are all disclosed in previous fillings . Just a brief summary, New CEO, Lance Alstodt was appointed for reorganization, Mr. Alstodt brings over 25 years of experience in leading medical technology and life sciences companies in operations, capital raising activities, strategy, and mergers and acquisitions. Auctus Management lend them money to continue operating and try to start the trial and uplist where institution can invest in the company and raise funding for Phase 2 Clinical Trials. With all the warrants and debt it had during bankruptcy, there was no other choices but to do RS (definitely hurts the old OTC shareholders) but in conjunction to the RS, CEO managed to get an agreement for warrants and common shares to be locked up in certain conditions, please read fillings. It was aggressively done so, to make sure it meets its requirement in NASDAQ and investors , because it could have been worse, another bk, but no, it met NASDAQ requirement and it was uplisted on 11/4/21. This is like a Phoenix rising from the ashes.

About BioRestorative Therapies, Inc.

BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ([www.biorestorative.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=G48NSWPkqD7gz0u-ebI2FYhb6wUgyzK9uJKtKuKhBmxTeXfR_EMNKom_6SGqDjoQk-P1KqzSaWdopkmHPRPveSa0XJMwWVDxBG9QpHa6fVI=)) develops therapeutic products using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells. Our two core programs, as described below, relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders:

 Disc/Spine Program (brtxDISC): Our lead cell therapy candidate, *BRTX-100,* is a product formulated from autologous (or a persons own) cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patients bone marrow. We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of painful lumbosacral disc disorders or as a complementary therapeutic to a surgical procedure. The *BRTX-100* production process utilizes proprietary technology and involves collecting a patients bone marrow, isolating and culturing stem cells from the bone marrow and cryopreserving the cells. In an outpatient procedure, *BRTX-100* is to be injected by a physician into the patients damaged disc. The treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of surgery. We have received authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial using *BRTX-100* to treat chronic lower back pain arising from degenerative disc disease.

 Metabolic Program (ThermoStem): We are developing a cell-based therapy candidate to target obesity and metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic homeostasis in humans. Initial preclinical research indicates that increased amounts of brown fat in animals may be responsible for additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid levels. Researchers have found that people with higher levels of brown fat may have a reduced risk for obesity and diabetes.

BRTX has numerous patents around the world.

1,"11/22/2021, 02:36:51",Shipping Rates are Through the Roof. Here's How to Play Them.,CptSafetyWafety,"We are nearly one month away from the West's greatest splurge on discretionary goods and Santa isn't the one bringing them into the Port of LA.

**Catalyst**

Due to the constant rhetoric that 'iNflaTIOn iz TranZuhToRY' and ""[no one saw](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1461651190144503808)[ it coming](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1461651190144503808)"" many companies that have benefited greatly from the increased prices were discounted. Nobody wanted to invest in lumber, freight, and oil because these price hikes were supposed to be temporary. As many are now admitting, inflation is [here to stay](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-may-need-to-pivot-to-faster-taper-waller-says-11637336865) and so are the aforementioned companies' sick margins. The catalyst is a great repricing of undervalued companies. \*Think Dr. Burry buying Gamestop at $5\* We literally have boomer stocks growing revenues and margins at the rates of start-ups (more on that below\*

**Shipping Rates**

As a result of the decreased labor force and QE, shipping rates have climbed close to 600% over the last year. However, recently they've plateaued and haven't shown any sign of returning to baseline.

[From $ZIM ](https://preview.redd.it/6v7dj97fdz081.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a78e8ce52437c4b66dd9c349bebfd1fa66c019f)

However, these rates are mostly just for freight from the East to the West. Prices are incredibly low if you'd like to [ship the other way](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/explained-why-the-shipping-container-crisis-will-not-end-soon-7743451.html), ""Shanghai-Los Angeles route was over $10,000 but under $1,300 in the reverse direction in the recent weeks"". 

**Demand**

Consumer spending continues to hit [all-time highs](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=19&amp;step=2#reqid=19&amp;step=2&amp;isuri=1&amp;1921=underlying) and the Port of LA is[ jakkt to the tits in congestion](https://www.businessinsider.com/cargo-ships-queues-pushed-150-miles-from-southern-california-coast-2021-11) with over 100 ships queued in a conga line 100 miles south.

# The Play

Any shipping company seems mispriced, however, I see the greatest opportunity I see is with $ZIM. [Here's](https://s27.q4cdn.com/416879924/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/ZIM-Q3-2021-investors-call-Final-17-11-2021.pdf) the link to their latest earnings. \*spoiler: they absolutely crushed it\*. I have literally looked at the top 12 largest, publicly-traded shipping companies and this one seems to have the greatest mismatch on price:value. 

**Margins**

$ZIM has one of (if not, the) highest margins of any shipping company in the industry with a 66% EBITDA margin (that's double $APPL). 

**Rate of growth**

Whether it has been their shipping fleet acquisitions, the freight prices, or efficient logistics $ZIM has 18X'd their profit YoY. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b

&amp;#x200B;

**Stock Performance**

$ZIM went public in January this year and has averaged a 100% return every quarter. For a **REAL** company, this is unparalleled. They literally just go up and to the right. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ptd3omdjlz081.png?width=2522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81cc178b902e40d8a4002aff7948ff657e4d5166

&amp;#x200B;

**Price Mismatch**

After looking at the top 12 highest market cap shipping companies, $ZIM seems to be the most mispriced. The average PE of the shipping industry is  \~6.9X (nice). While $ZIM trades @ 3.3X. Even if $ZIM were to normalize at the industry's average, that's over a 100% return. If you look at revenue, $ZIM brings in roughly 20% of Maersk's $AMKBY (the largest shipping company by MC) revenue while trading at \~10% of the valuation.  If you were to normalize $ZIM (66% margin) with $AMKBY (41% margin) based upon net profit, you'd expect a 130% return from the current price of $57. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Comparison across some shipping companies.](https://preview.redd.it/6wve2xa8tz081.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e2984facc1c048ebec1529ea691d516ad1161cb)

**The Next Run**

After $ZIM completely destroyed their Q3 earnings ($12.16 vs $8.99 EPS) and announced a market-leading dividend (20% of quarter's net income with a 4th quarter dividend equal to 30-50% of annual net income), and heavy volume has started coming in over the last few days. People are starting to notice. If we assume a similar profit for Q4, their '21 annual profit is \~$4.5B. We know that based on shares outstanding divided by net income with a 20% dividend is $2.50. This means that their 4th quarter dividend (assumed at the midpoint of 40%) will be $15. At a current share price of $57, you'd basically get **a 26% return just from a single dividend.**  If you don't think boomers and pensions that love dividends aren't going to jump into this stock then go YOLO into some weed stocks (RIP. Long $ROPE). 

&amp;#x200B;

**How to Play**

$ZIM's ex-dividend date is Dec 15th so, if you'd like the dividend (like me) you'd have to get in before that date. If you think the stock will massively skyrocket from dividend investors, here's the options chain. You'll notice the most volume taking place at the $60 strike calls. These calls also have the greatest #gamma and could offer a great return with a breakeven price of $62.60.

1,"11/22/2021, 00:01:21",I think I found an infinite money glitch on Robinhood. Free Money!,dougball69,"**This might sound dumb af, but its so stupid it might actually work. Heres my outline of the idea:**

1. Get a Robinhood account with margin, preferably with a huge portfolio so you can be leveraged out the ass
2. Throw all of your money into Robinhood FDs, right before an earnings call.
3. Robinhood should (keyword: should) notice such an inbred play, that it should result in some concern.

**Now, this can go one of two routes if they notice:**

A) They plan on having a blowout earnings report, and will let the position(s) go through

B) They have another shitty quarter, and realize that your position in their company is absolute trash and will get completely obliterated. Now, this is the most likely outcome! They will be forced to close out your position; cause they know damn well the pizza boy living in his moms basement cant afford such a massive loss.

If all hell breaks loose and you get fucked over; you could argue in court that there should have been a lot more risk management. After incidents like GUHH! and the legendary Box Spread, it shouldve been obvious! Or you can just delete the app, that seems to work too.

Good luck with this infinite money hack! Highly recommend doing it every quarter.

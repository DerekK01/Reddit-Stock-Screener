# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* As inflationary pressures continued to resonate across markets, equities in the US rose, led by technology and communication services.
* After a drop on Wednesday due to higher-than-expected consumer prices, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.7% in its second day of gains. After announcing that it will split into two companies, Johnson &amp; Johnson gained. After revealing production delays, and Lordstown Motors' stock dropped.
* The value of treasuries has dropped.
* While global stocks have experienced their first weekly loss since early October, their losses pale in comparison to the bond market's gyrations.
* Following a strong corporate results season, stocks have remained near all-time highs. Bond traders, on the other hand, are concerned that rising inflation would lead to tighter monetary policy. Consumer confidence in the US has slipped to a 10-year low.
* After a US trade holiday on Thursday, Treasury rates climbed on Friday, with the 30-year bond gaining 4 basis points. Meanwhile, a measure of the yield curve in the United States has flattened to its lowest level since March 2020.
* Stocks in Europe rose, led by luxury consumer companies, while shares in Asia rose, aided by a rally in Japan.
* The dollar declined as a result of the US' warning that Russia may be contemplating an invasion of Ukraine.
* Oil slipped and gold erased previous losses.

This is super simple, AMC has been consolidation for months! That means its loading up for a move, this could be up or down but with the news they have been releasing and that other meme stocks are performing well and still covered in the news I'd anticipate this to be a move up and to the right.

This is one of the simplest and easiest patterns to identify so it likely has a LOT of eyes watching it, which can be a very good thing.

I've included some targets for the weak on the chart so if the price sees a little slowing in those areas you know it's because the poor need to take profits to cover their rent.   
For those that like the stock, the actual measured move is also shown. If the price starts to move north you will see AMC flood the media and WSB posts, which will easily make it ape into the moon targets.

Goed is the largest pureplay online appliance retailer in the US. Ticker symbol GOED

About Goed?
They recently bought a larger company appliance connection and significantly restructured their capital structure. They are going through a rebranding and will have their new name and branding campaign released in the next few weeks


Earnings- company is reporting earnings 8am this Monday. 

Fundamentals/technicals
Company is currently trading at approximately .5 times their current sales. With a profit margin of around 10% and a growth rate of 20-25% you wont find a better growth and value play.  They have a forward p/e of 2.93. They are expected to grow in 2022 to 750mil in revenue from 550 mil. However there are rumblings they could hit 1 billion in 2022. Company has a current market cap of under 300 million!!!!  RSI is extremely high and i am not much of a chart guy but even Stevie wonder can see this is oversold . 

Shortsqueeze?
You can find better squeeze plays but you wont find a better undervalued company to squeeze.  Days to cover is currently over 5. Float is at 100 million however institutional ownerships is currently above 50% and short interest is at 13 million shares . Interestingly enough 70% of dark pool volume is short shares. Something off has been happening with this stock for way too long. Institutional ownerships has continued to increase while weak retail hands have been shaken out. 

Intangibles

CEO recently bought 1 million worth of stock.

Company is having their annual meeting and is concerned with their institutional ownership rising and valuation so low that they are a prime take over potential. To circumvent this they want to have the ability to dilute ownership if need be(vote is required on this in December)

Option Friday 
The last few options weeks this stock has continually burned the shorts.  Something odd definitely happens every third week on this stock the last few months. 

Calls to action
Do your own deep dive. Company is a solid company that has been manipulated for far too long. Monday we take a position and burn the shorts. Long term strong hold!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qt2aqd/monday_is_going_to_be_a_goed_day_read_below_to/

1,"11/13/2021, 22:11:43",Opendoor earnings dont paint the full picture,Striking-Menu-2491,"Opendoor is one of at least four public companies engaged in the business of buying and selling single family homes using automated pricing algorithms. Others include Zillow, Redfin and Offerpad. The companies aim to streamline the home buying and selling process by moving the buying and selling process online. They hope to buy homes, fix them up and then relist the homes with a 10-15% mark-up. Additionally, they hope to add additional services and fees to the transactions that will improve their revenue. Opendoor went public through a SPAC transaction last year and has been in business since 2014. The company had $2.3 billion in sales last quarter and has a balance sheet with $9.0 billion of assets ($6.3 billion of homes) and $6.6 billion of liabilities ($5.3 billion of SPE debt). At the beginning of 2021, Opendoor had real estate inventory of $465 million and $346 million of SPE debt. Opendoor is the largest of the four companies and is roughly 2x the number two, Zillow.
 
On November 2, Zillow announced it was exiting this business and taking total charges of over $569 million because the company had over-estimated the ultimate selling prices of homes in its portfolio.  The charges represent a roughly 8-10% discount to the original purchase prices. Zillow commented that the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated.
 
Opendoors financial statements and investor communications focus heavily on several Non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit/Margin, Contribution Profit/Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA/Margin.  These measures serve to obscure the true nature of the business and the underlying financial performance of the company.  
 
Opendoors business model is to buy assets (homes) using significant financial leverage and to subsequently sell those assets at a profit. Additionally, they hope to capture fees around the buying/selling transactions to supplement their revenue. Banks, investment banks and finance companies have similar business models and similar balance sheets. However, most their assets generate income during the holding period. Banks make loans (assets) and hope to add additional non-interest fees and business to existing relationships. Unlike other financial institutions, Opendoor doesnt earn income from its portfolio of investments and must spend money to maintain the houses for maintenance, taxes, utilities and other items.
 
By electing to focus on Contribution Margin and EBITDA Margin, the company seems to be trying to differentiate itself from other firms that generate income by financing assets on the balance sheet. This focus has the potential to mislead investors. When combined with the lack of disclosure, discussed below, the company is misrepresenting and omitting key information in their public filings and financial statements. The Non-GAAP measures can show positive results while the true performance is deteriorating. That started to happen this quarter and is the direct result of how Opendoor calculates Contribution Profit. Given the dramatic downturn in Zillows business, this is a potential red flag.
 
The Letter to Shareholders for 3rd Quarter 2021 proudly states (page 9 of Letter to Shareholders):
 
Contribution Profit, which accounts for the direct selling and holding costs incurred on the homes sold during the quarter, was $170 million in 3Q21, up 33% versus 2Q21. Contribution Margin, which we view as an important measure of unit economics associated with a specific resale cohort, was 7.5% versus 10.8% in 2Q21.
 
The contribution margin calculation adds the Inventory Valuation Adjustment to the Gross Margin. The Inventory Valuation Adjustment is a number that reflects the impairment of existing inventory (page 43 3rd Quarter 10Q). Some part of the homes on the balance sheet are now worth less than the original cost of the home and their value is now adjusted downward. This is similar to a loan loss reserve for banks or finance companies.  Imagine a bank saying their Net Interest Margin was great if it werent for the loan loss reserves. In future quarters, higher impairment charges will not have a negative impact on Adjusted Gross Margin or Contribution Margin. Because the company has framed itself in non-financial terms, they can continue to report positive Non-GAAP results even if portfolio quality declines.  The company is presenting false and misleading information about its financial reporting and will continue to do so with the existing focus on Non-GAAP measures.

 
The focus on Adjusted EBITDA has the same effect as the focus on Contribution Margin. It reframes the company as a non-financial business and seems to show positive cash flow (EBITDA) because of the add backs and adjustments. Costs for financing are central to the business model for this company. By adding interest financing costs and inventory impairment to GAAP Net Loss in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, the company is overstating its available cash flow significantly.  Most companies that report EBITDA numbers are showing they have cash available to support long term debt obligations. Although Opendoor has some long term debt, they seem to be using EBITDA to obscure the fact they are a financial company.  (page 45 of 3rd quarter 10Q).  

The companys disclosures relating to its portfolio of homes makes it impossible to do any real analysis of the performance of these assets.  Additionally, some metrics that would usually be available for financial service firms and not presented by Opendoor.
 
Portfolio Aging  The company presents a three line description of its portfolio on page 15 of the 3rd quarter 10Q.

The company should report aging of the homes in the portfolio. The aging is important in the credit facilities because it determines eligibility and potentially haircut for financing. For investors this would be a key metric to evaluate the company performance. This is especially important going into the seasonally slow period of the year.
 
There is no detail on the inventory impairment. However, it went from $942,000 in the 2nd quarter to $32,602,000 in the 3rd quarter. In previous quarters, the company apparently made more than anticipated on some homes with impairment. However, that information is hidden in the cash flow statement. Much like banks report loan loss reserves, Opendoor should detail impairments. This is especially true given the huge charges at Zillow and the dramatic rise in Opendoors impairments. I was able to review a sampling of homes available for sale in four markets. Based on a semi-random analysis of homes currently for sale, Opendoor has many homes for sale at or below the original purchase price.
 
The company had 17,164 homes at the end of the 3rd quarter. Based on an initial review of property records in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Opendoor owns 1,724 homes in that county. If we added the surrounding counties to include the full Phoenix MSA, Opendoor would have a significant concentration of assets in that one market. Since this was where they started, its not surprising to see the high concentration, but portfolio diversification is key any investment strategy. Concentration should be disclosed. The company talks about being in 44 markets, but that figure misrepresents the real situation.
 
Since Opendoors assets have a significant cost of carry, in the form of financing costs, property taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance, and other items. Details on these costs should be available for investors. Much like banks and finance companies break out details of their interest income, Opendoor should provide detail on their negative carry costs.

On page 57 of the 3rd Quarter 10Q the company says:  
Management identified control deficiencies that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to our information technology general controls over certain accounting and proprietary systems used in our financial reporting.

Given the enormous ramp in the companys activity this year, it seems unlikely the disclosures on page 58 sufficiently address the issues. A financial services firm with thousands of properties to repair, maintain and resell needs rock solid systems and controls. That needs more discussion in the disclosures. My analysis of several markets showed they my be under reserved for potential losses in the existing portfolio.  Given the weakness of systems and financial controls, this isnt surprising.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qt21vq/opendoor_earnings_dont_paint_the_full_picture/

# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.
*****
&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said hes also looking at the New York Federal Reserves Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.
*****
&gt; Thats going to be key, outside of that its retail sales, Boockvar said. I think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.
*****
&gt; I think its good that they would be on a talking basis, Boockvar said. I dont think anything would come out of it unless theres some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.
*****
&gt; # Chain store earnings
&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Walmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins, National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.
*****
&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.
*****
&gt; Its so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say, Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.
*****
&gt; The trend that were looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data, Hogan said. Thats the important thing to focus on.
*****
&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.
*****
&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.
*****
&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.
*****
&gt; I think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October, he said. The good news is demand hasnt been destroyed. Its been delayed. Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.
*****
&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. What would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things  hubris and debt, he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of management gone awry and many companies restructured their debt.
*****
&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.
*****
&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. I think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters, he said.

&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th

&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.

&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).

&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately

&gt; Next week is not only Novembers monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.

&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, 0.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, 0.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful

&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Lets look at some reasons to be thankful.

&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, theres a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Although the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant, explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. We fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.

&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.

&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening weve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.

&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.

&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour

&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**

&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism indexPlans to Make Capital Outlaysmoving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**

&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**

&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**

&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.

-Don't buy SPCE for at least a couple of years, except if it hits an old time low.

Please give me your advice, if i may ask. I appreciate this group is often very focused on YOLOs &amp; options, so for that, I apologise in advance but i figured you are the right bunch to ask

What's the best platform to use for easy trading. I have used Trader Work Station (with Interactive Brokers) but I wouldn't say it's easy nor intuitive. I use that at work but want something super retail for personal trading. I played around with the incredibly easy Trading 212. Great interface but they are just the usual cowboys. 
They fuck you on execution, steal your stop loss early and close your take profit late. Ideally i want to be able to set Stop Loss and Take Profit by a fixed value / distance, as opposed to market price (too fiddly). Also i enjoy the functionality of being able to click and drag SLs and TPs...

This subreddit has a tonne of stock in a few meme companies in particular, such as GME, Tesla, etc. If you have stock, this means you have the voting rights to elect someone to the board of a company. This means that we have enough stock in total to elect someone to the board of these companies. We can elect a member of this community to become a fully-fledged board member of a large multi-national company. Since I'm an Australian, I think I can only be elected to something like Afterpay's board, but in short, if we chose an American national they can be given a full-time job as a fully-fledged board member of a large publicly listed company such as GME or TSX purely through reddit.

Generally most companies pick insiders to go through the internal AGMs to nominate candidates to become part of the board, however very few people vote in these because they often don't care, since nobody usually cooperates to elect someone to a board. However, with a fully centralized discussion like we have here on r/wallstreetbets, we can elect our chosen candidate to be a member of a board.

Now we just need a process to elect the candidate. I guess suggest your idea for an election process in the comments and we can go for the top-voted, legal one there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsyzkb/lets_elect_a_board_member/

Retail investors realized it was a juicy deal before earning so money poured in the stock. Shorties waited for retail investors to push the stock up after earning report. Then shorties went all in dragging the stock down to toilet the next morning. Some of the retail investors panicked and got out their positions at a loss. Shorties made lots of money, then go shopping for their new yachts this weekend. 

Just pointing out some facts how far from reality the market really is. SFT valuation +500m. Revenue +600m. Now looks at what I call 'hot garbage', 'bubble stocks: 

RIVN - $103b valuation - 42 cars delivered (mainly to employees) - Expects to spend over $1b this quarter to make $1m in revenue.

FSR - $5.9b valuation - It expects to deliver 700 vehicles by 2023 (another 2 years). $0 revenue

LCID - $72b valuation - It expects to deliver 577 cars in 2021 with only 13,000 reservations. $76m revenue

And this my friends is the level of insanity in the current market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsya9k/shorts_are_manipulating_tf_out_of_sft_technologies/

If you import into the usa that info is sorta public record. I found this [https://www.usitc.gov/import\_monitoring.htm](https://www.usitc.gov/import_monitoring.htm) which has a list of tools like [https://dataweb.usitc.gov/](https://dataweb.usitc.gov/).   The first link has other tools in the Web Research Portals section on   the left. Gov tools suck and are hard to use so I went commercial and   found this: [https://www.seair.co.in/us-import/i-stonegate-foods/e-ittella-italy-srl.aspx](https://www.seair.co.in/us-import/i-stonegate-foods/e-ittella-italy-srl.aspx) it seams they have been importing and the descriptions seam to match the products on their site.

The  specific numbers are probably wrong but I think the message is clear,  NUMBERS ARE WAY LOW. Italian Grown, LA made. I assumed each pkg was a  serving similar to the way MCD delivers source ingredients to their  restaurants if the factory was in italy. Everything is shipped and a pkg  is 1 serving. I used the (number of pkgs \* base price, low, High). In  the description it sometimes lists where its going like aldi and sams  club. aldi is a discount retailer compared to the other stores around me  so I went with  targets low price of 4.29 vs [ttcf.com](https://ttcf.com/)'s base price of $8. Sams club sells only multipaks for $12.95 the HIGH.

The range I have chosen should cover any variations in price across their menu. I maybe low on 1 item but high on another.

The Retail Dollar Value of total goods imported from aug 27 - oct 23

LOW = $177,164.13     BASE: $340,206.1      HIGH: $534,796.15

These  low numbers could be wrong based on my definition of a ""PKG"", but we  know their is a supply chain shortage that not even amazon or apple  could avoid and I did well on TXN puts. Companies doing the actual  shipping (trucks, ships and air freight) are making record breaking  profits even during a labor shortage with truck drivers. Further  analysis can be found in my comments and I did find some good threads  and comments on this sub.

The  low numbers would explain why they are holding up their ER. As a new  company and a first time offender the penalty for filing late or not at  all is going to be a very small fine if anything. They are also avoiding  a lawsuit by not lying and hiding.

I  was in $RKT. I learned to recognize the slow bleed of a falling knife  only to have my fingers sliced off at earnings. I'm seeing similar price  action with TTCF.

I have a pretty  good idea where guidance is going for qtr 4. I could go back a year on  seair.co.in and track each quarter back to see how it correlates with  earnings but whats available seams ugly enough.

What  is your bull case for this quarters earnings and next quarters  guidance?

Two days after IPO Rivian has increased by 69.49% to 132.20$ per share and reached a market cap of 112 billion. Rivian is an electric vehicle company and to date has sold &gt;200 vehicles however hopes to expand that to 1 million per year by 2030. Both Amazon and ford have large stakes in Rivian and Amazon plans to purchase 100,000 of Rivians electric vans that they plan to produce in the future.

The best company to compare Rivian to is Tesla since it's the biggest all electric vehicle manufacturer. When Tesla first IPOd it had already sold over 1000 vehicles and had a market cap of around 2 billion which is 55x less than Rivians today. I think this is absurd, Rivian has yet to prove it's ability to scale yet has a market cap a 10th of Teslas while selling more than 1000x less vehicles. (this is excluding the fact that tesla has other businesses outside automotive deliveries that attribute to its market cap) Considering that Rivian is at extremely low volume at the moment and is experiencing its first factory ramp there will most likely be delays which could affect the outlook (we have seen this with tesla having numerous delays). We do not know what rivians margins are, they could be as low as 10% like traditional OEMs or as high as 30% like tesla. 

I do think that Rivian has potential , it looks like they have a good product from the reviews I've seen and they have big backers but at the moment the euphoria around the stock is baseless.

With all of these uncertainties I think that Rivians current stock price is completely unjustified and I plan on shorting it once options become available. What do you plan on doing in regards to Rivian?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qssqe4/thoughts_on_rivians_price_being_at_130_after_ipo/

1,"11/13/2021, 11:36:08",Big gains over 2-3 years $GOGO $BLNK $BNED,anon88664422,"  

I am sharing with you degenerates because Ive made enough money, that I dont talk to friends and family about it. Thats also why Im posting on my alt account.

I opened a brokerage account with USAA in 2018 with $10,200. USAA shut down their brokerage and transferred all clients to Schwab in 2020. At that time, the net value of my money from transfers into and out of the account were $15,055.11. Since then, I have taken $28,500 out of my Schwab account. So my net funds invested into my Schwab account are -13,444.89. I have actually made $13,444.89 into my checking account with all those trades. When the USAA account migrated to Schwab on 22May2020, it was worth $31,983.09. The current value of the Schwab account is $280,345.80.  That means the total gain is $293,790.69 with all those trades, and gotten all my original capital out +13,444.89.

In November2021, I opened a Robinhood account with $5,000. I have since taken out of that account $8,014.41. The current value of the account is $18,641.53. That means the total gain is $26,655.94 and I got out my initial investment of $5000 + 3,014.41.  
 

So total monies transferred from my day job earnings to investments $20,055.11. Total monies withdrawn from investments to my checking account $21,459.30. So I am essentially back at zero for monies invested, yet have a total value of $298,987.33 of value in the accounts.

I am also a (very slow) real estate investor and currently have $1,581,005 worth of property to which I owe $1,090,645 for equity of $490,360 with 69% (nice) leverage.  
 

I trade pretty frequently, but the bulk of my gains have been with $GOGO, $BLNK, and $BNED. I just wanted to share with yall. There are hundreds of pages of statements to back up these exact figures, but for now Ill just share a couple pictures. I do have supporting docs as mentioned, but it would take a long time to clear the PDFs of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

Value at the end of 2019: $33,396.99 (I am not accounting for withdraws)

Value at the end of 2020: $123,992.78 (I am not accounting for withdraws)

Value current After Close 12Nov2021: $298,987.33 (I am accounting for all withdraws in all years here $21,459.30 withdrawn of $20,055.11 invested)

Between carbon emissions for production and the trash islands accumulating in multiple oceans all over the world, it has been a long held understanding that plastics will eventually lead to many of mankind's greatest downfalls. How do we fix this you ask?

We start with the creation of virgin plastics-newly produced plastic materials which typically (traditionally) emit tonnes of greenhouse gasses. *Enter Origin Materials*. 

The company is comprised of Rich Riley, inventor of the browser toolbar you use to google the ingredients of the crayons you've been snorting (as well as Yahoo exec, Shazam CEO, and KKR and Co. advisor), and John Bissell, chemist extraordinaire.  Between the two, this company has managed to create *AND PATENT* 19 different processes for biochemically derived, carbon NEGATIVE industrial plastics. They literally use saw dust, food waste and cardboard to make plastic chemically identical (and price competitive) to what we make out of fossil fuels. 

These products range from PET to raw chemical substrates like chloromethyl furfural (CMF) and hydrothermal carbon (HTC). 

Bruh, I don't know what that means. But I do know that you bois have been missing the F'in H out. 

With half a billion in cash and assets, damn near zero debt, a billion dollar market cap and over 4 billion in contracted orders (for an initial facility being built right now, months ahead of schedule, might I add), to address a TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET, $ORGN is set to be the Green Initiative play of the mufuggin Green Initiative. ALL. Of their products. ARE CARBON *NEGATIVE*. 

""But why do we care?"" Because, my lovely tards, Ford cares. Because Nestle cares. Because Danone and Volkswagon and Daimler and Toyota and Kolon Industries and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical care and Palantir ($PLTR) care.

With industry orders and sales topping Origin 1 (first production facility due circa late 2022) out of capacity and Origin 2 (currently in negotiations and fully commissioned as is, due 2025) this company hasn't even finished their first building yet. Yet the line is already out the proverbial door. 

Their process is patented. Their products are derived from renewable resources. Their clientele is a growing, cash laden list of industry behemoths. Their board is comprised of William Gong and Jeremy Bedard of Exxon and their tendies have me jacked. To the absolute tits.

Most people will say they are losing revenu and market. 1) No Recent Tech IPO is profitable, they need money to grow and the IPO provide that money those high growth company needs. 2) Wish lost market share, howerver they are implementing a lot of correction before squeezing the ads for the whole entreprise to be profitable. Still, 90 users on a stock that is pretty much woth 1 Year sale is insane, My Target is 30+ in 2022. 

Here is few takeaways after last earning call :

1) 5$ is truly the historical bottom

2) Wish will grow to be a much better profitable company, with better retentention

3) We will see significant quality upgrades on the products in 2022

4) Wish is making deals like there is no tomorrow with a lot of company

 All the steps are in place for a turnover within a year. This is ridiculously undervalued. Top that with a ceo replacement and 243 jobs posting within a month, I would say things are moving in place and someone has a clear plan with this company. You dont hire so much people if you are not planning on growing . Why is the replacement of the CEO important, because it means changes are coming :   if you believe that your company is planning to merge, or has secretly already agreed to merge, and the announcement might not be for several months, then the resignation of key employees can be seen as bullish.  So lets put pieces together. Wish has been posting a lot of executives positions on linked recently. A lot of the management team comes from tech and google. Now the new cfo Vivian managed buyout for two previous companies. Seems like wish will follow the track

1,"11/13/2021, 10:05:59",$CRTO - Deep value + High quality + Short squeeze play,doublebottomW,"First off, Criteo is a full funnel ad tech company that focuses on delivering effective digital advertising results to marketers and helps media owners to monetize their content/platform. It started out with only the retargeting businessbut now offers a full suite of online advertising solutions for both marketers (demand side) and media owners (supply side).  


I know Apples privacy protection has casted a shadow on the online ad players such as Meta, Tradedesk, Snap, Magnite, etc. However, I believe $CRTO is the most insulated among its peers and its share price could easily double from here. Let me share the reasons why.

  
\+**1st party data Moat**\- Criteo started its journey to future-proof its business by building 1st party data more than 2 years ago when its core retargeting business was threatened by the phasing out of 3rd party cookies. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise as the firm is now ahead of its peers in creating a business model that delivers superior ad results without relying on 3rd party identification. I find the management at Criteo explained this point extremely well. See the snapshot of their 3Q21 presentation slides below.

  
Their efforts to focus on building 1st party data is validated with their impressive 3Q21 results (this is the quarter where ad tech firms experienced Apple ATTs full impact), beating estimates across revenue, EBITDA and EPS and raising the outlook for 4Q21.

https://preview.redd.it/rrgmgotys9z71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d227aed316f056aee9622964f6419d49b9ea927

  
\+**Short squeeze potential**\- the days to cover ranges from 10 to 18 days (since31 Aug). This data may change significantlyon 15th Nov(update from Nasdaq website)given the sharp spike in the share price post Criteos 3Q results. Nevertheless, this stock is a small cap and daily volume isnt high. Demand for its shares can produce a very sharp rally and make it difficult for shorts to get out without sustaining heavy losses.

  
\+**Share repurchase program extended from $100m to $175m**\- Criteo had already repurchased $73m for the period Mar-Sep. That leaves another $100m. For a stock with market cap around $2.5b, thats easily a 4% boost.  
\+**Deep Value**\- Criteo is currently valued at a discount to Magnite, PubMatic and TTD. Its peers are either pure-play DSP or SSP. Criteo is the only one that generates sizable revenue on the ad demand and supply side (other than Google). This should be interpreted as a quality feature with its diversified revenue stream. I believe at this point the market still has not fully recognized that Criteo is well-positioned to navigate the privacy headwinds with 1st party data and new solutions. Its growth rate may also be underestimated by the market. The markets perception may change soon with Criteos impressive 3Q21.

  
My view is Criteos valuation gap between its peers should narrow and perhaps even trade at a premium above Magnite and PubMatic. The latter are smaller in scale, less diversified, behind $CRTO in terms of managing privacy protection and their projected growth rates are probably too optimistic. (The valuation table below is slightly outdated but the reasoning is still relevant given that the valuation gap hasnt narrowed significantly)

https://preview.redd.it/gay4s8pcs9z71.png?width=3924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12fdccf1021350a8054e2d3e81be38acec3f230f

  
\+**Growth play with a large TAM**\- To be clear, Criteo is not a sunset business. They are supported by underlying secular trend (more marketing spend shifting to digital ad) and positioned on a large $100b TAM (2024e) with a CAGR of \~22%. Its new solutions business which comprises about 1/3 of its revenue is expected to grow at more than 40% yoy in 4Q21. I believe this is a growth play that is grossly mispriced. 

\+**Strong financials (if it matters to you)**:

* FCF for 9m 2021 at $112m or 53% Of adjusted EBITDA  

* Net cash at $497m which translates to \~20% of market cap ($2.5b as of writing)  

* Adjusted EBITDA margin at \~32% of revenue  ex traffic acquisition cost (rev ex-tac) at 3Q. This is expected to increase to 35% in 4Q21

\+**Potential acquisition target**\- Undemanding valuation, strong FCF, fortress balance sheet, strong secular growth trend and 1st party data moat. These are all valid points that could make Criteo an attractive target for takeover by other ad tech firms or PE funds.  
I bought the shares of $CRTO since early 2021 as I believe in the long term potential of this company. Added some calls and sold puts as well. Below are my positions.

1,"11/13/2021, 08:06:22",Why I am Long on $MAPS. WM Holdings DD,UCACashFlow,"WM Holdings is in my opinion is misunderstood and undervalued. I have been following the company since February 2021 a few months before it went public via SPAC financing on 06/10/21. Until recently the stock had a solid level of resistance around $12 and fell to roughly $9. Why is the stock being beaten down? Is this indicative of the companys performance or overly pessimistic sentiment? I will dive into my take on this, and why the recent price movement and price trends are not concerning from my perspective.


I see the current price as a tremendous opportunity to buy and hold and take advantage of the cannabis industry without any direct exposure to regulations that companies handling the product face, and risk of product oversaturation in markets that growers will face post-legalization or decriminalization on the Federal level. I will speak to federal legalization, but what I mean is any material movement on the federal level, be it decriminalization or delisting as a sch. 1 substance.


Please note, this is not a get rich overnight stock, however, this is a solid stock to get in early on and hold through any movement on the federal side. Hear me out on this, because at the very least you should be watching this company.


It is not my intent to discuss the companys generic background. I am not discussing their history of profitability and YOY growth since 2008. I find given their business resets in the US and Canada, historical sales and earnings are irrelevant outside of the fact that they are an early-market leader and have experience via early establishment in the industry. I am also not diving into the newer management and their autobiographies, as this is all basic qualitative information that is nice to know, but I find it mostly irrelevant, and you can easily find this in the analyst presentations linked at the bottom.


Personal Disclosure:

This isnt financial advice or persuasion. All data provided is presented for discussion and educational purposes only, and most of all is my limited and subjective opinion. This is my personal take on what I believe to be an undervalued company. I believe the company is undervalued due to the companies strengths, the lack of understanding on how the company generates sales, and the unreasonable hesitation of investors due to being scared of weed stocks. MAPS is different than most weed stocks, and Ill explain why.


I have watched this stock daily since February 2021, and have kept up with news and analysts presentations. I am not an expert by any means. I personally do not use MAPS  App or website regularly, although I have years ago. I have friends/acquaintances that use the app in the Los Angeles area for personal consumption reasons. My post is in no way sponsored by WM or WM Holdings or of any outside interests. I come from a background in commercial banking and credit underwriting, which is not the same as securities analysis or investment banking, thus this is my unqualified opinion. 


I simply see value in SAAS side of the business, and the stickiness of their products in addition to the competitive advantages offered to the company due to its high liquidity in going public, its early entrance into the industry, and its placement as an industry leader spearheading legalization efforts. The fact this company had over a decade of consecutive profitability initially caught my attention due to no one else in the cannabis industry having any similar performance or experience.


There has been a lot of pessimism around this stock due to the current price movements. I feel like this is just short term, and I am not at all concerned. I have ridden from $29 down to $11.91 with about 4,900 shares in my IRA, and have about 1,200 shares at $13.30 in my brokerage. This is all based on my perceptions alone based on readily available information. Invest at your own risk.


1-year Price Targets:

I will link at the end of this post the actual documents/presentations that I have access to.


 Piper Sandler - $16.00 (82.85% upside from 11/21/21 low of $8.75)

 JNP - $21.00 (140% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

 Truist - $18.00 (105% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

 Canaccord - $21.00 (140% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

 BTIG - $17.50 (100% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

 Stifel - $19.00 (117% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

 Average  $18.75 (114% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)



Lets start by discussing the obvious cons and get into the pros later. The stock has seen declines in price, and theyre not pretty. I believe this is driven by overly pessimistic market sentiment which is in turn creating opportunities to be taken advantage of. I believe there is an overreaction on future guidance numbers vs the companys actual strengths and understanding the business cycle. Why panic over a single quarter that hasnt been realized? Nothings changed in my mind.


Why did the Stock Price decline after Q2 earnings release in August 2021?
Q2 was the companies first quarter under its belt as a publicly traded company. Q2 Revenues increased 21% to $47mln (55% adjusted YOY growth). Additionally, Adjusted EBITA of $8.5mln was down YOY, and Wall Street was not excited. 2021 Guidance was reaffirmed.


 At face value, Q2 information didnt seem all that exciting for a growth company. However, there are important adjustments to be made to understand the companys normalized performance. Earnings were down YOY, but this was driven by one-time costs associated with the 06/10/21 merger in addition to prior year inflated earnings discussed below.

 YOY revenue growth of 21% was driven by inflated prior year sales from non-licensed dispensaries. The company conducted a reset in its Canadian markets and eliminated ties with all non-licensed dispensaries via delisting from the MAPS marketplace. The company similarly had a reset in US business around 2019. When adjusting YOY growth to account for eliminating prior year illicit sales, the company saw a 55% increase in legitimate growth centered in US markets. This is material since the US market upon any Federal level movement will be much bigger than the Canadian market.

 It is important to note that the biggest difference between Adjusted EBITA and EBITA is that Adjusted EBITA subtracts the Change in fair value of warrant liabilities which was $38mln at 06/30/21. There are other offsetting line items however, this is biggest differentiator between EBITA and Adjusted EBITDA. The company doesnt pay warrant liabilities until exercised. Until then the liability is based on outstanding warrants and stock price at the time of reporting. Adjusted EBIDTA in my opinion is for discussion purposes to demonstrate what earnings would be if the company paid warrants at that time.


Q2 Quick Highlights:

 Revenue: $47mln (21% YOY increase; 55% adjusted)

 Gross Profit Margin: 95.93% (95.21% in prior year)

 Operating Income (loss): ($15mln)

 Net Income: $16.8mln (78.72% YOY increase)

 EBIDTA: $17mln (67.90% YOY increase)

 Adjusted EBITA: $8.5mln (18.27% YOY decline)

 Q2 Monthly Active Users MAUs: 12.3mln (75% YOY increase)

 Q2 Average Monthly revenue per paying client: $3,706 (24% YOY increase; 21% adjusted)

 Q2 Average Monthly paying clients: 4,221 (2% YOY decrease; 28% adjusted)


Q2 Earnings Release: (https://ir.weedmaps.com/news-releases/news-release-details/wm-technology-inc-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results)


Why did the Stock Price decline after Q3 earnings release in November 2021?

Q3 was the companies second quarter as a publicly traded company. Q3 Revenues met guidance and increased 9% YOY to $50.9mln (46% YOY adjusted growth). Additionally, Q3 adjusted EBITA of $10.4mln was down YOY, but exceeded Q3 guidance expectations. The stock fell primarily due to Q4 Guidance which was adjusted downward to $50mln-$52mln revenue expectation ($16mln down from annual FYE 21 guidance of $205mln), and $3mln-$5mln adjusted EBITDA expectations ($17mln down from annual FYE 21 guidance of $50mln).


 Stock price fell due to Q4 Guidance adjustments largely based on the decline of Adjusted EBIDTA.

 Legitimate Q3 Revenue grew 46% YOY when excluding sales associated with Canada-based operators who failed to provide a valid license. Gross Profit margin increased to 96%.

 The companys net income of $49.2mln reflected a 217% YOY increase up from $15.5mln in the prior year. This was primarily driven by $46mln which came from the change in FMV of warrant liabilities. It is important to note that the FMV of warrant liabilities is represented as both income/expense on the companies profit and loss statement, and as a liability and equity item on the balance sheet.

 While guidance on sales and earnings was adjusted downwards, anticipations are still that cash flow will be positive. Additionally, the guidance was for Adjusted EBITDA which is materially impacted by FMV of warrant liabilities which may be dramatically different at 12/31/2021 depending on the factors at that time.

 The company is still highly liquid post acquisition of Sprout, and the parent companies of Cannveya and CannCurrent. This is due to June 2021 SPAC financing, which is really the only funding they could reasonably obtain, given the listing as a Sch. 1 substance. The intention was to prepare for Federal movement early to obtain an advantage and head start via Mergers, Acquisitions, marketing campaigns, and growth to generate returns.

 The companys largest liability is centered in Warrant Liabilities which is determined as of the date of the information provided and is impacted by warrants outstanding and stock price at the timing that information is reported. The warrants have a strike of $11.50 and expire after 5-years or if the stock trades at/above $18 for 20/30 trading days.


Q3 Quick Highlights:

 Revenue: $50.8mln (9% YOY increase; 46% adjusted)

 Gross Profit Margin: 96% (95.47% in prior year)

 Operating Income (loss): $4mln

 Net Income: $49.2mln (216.84% YOY increase)

 EBIDTA: $50.5mln (206.14% YOY increase)

 Adjusted EBITA: $10.4mln (36.96% YOY decline)

 Q3 Monthly Active Users MAUs: 13.9mln (37% YOY increase)

 Q3 Average Monthly revenue per paying client: $3,817 (7% YOY increase; 18% adjusted)

 Q3 Average Monthly paying clients: 4,444 (2% YOY decrease; 24% adjusted)

Alright, now that we have discussed the last two quarters, why the price has fallen, adjustments that should be considered, its time I substantiate my opinion.


Services &amp; Revenue Generation:


1. WM Holdings source of revenue and product offerings:

The market has been overly pessimistic about MAPS since the start. Initially when the company announced its intention to go public via Silver Spike, I recall reading articles that spoke to it simply being an overvalued listing service. I feel this is a gross misrepresentation of the companys potential and a lack of understanding on how the company generates revenues. There are two sides to the companys revenue generation. WM Holdings generates approximately 77% of sales from various advertising products (Maps Market place, app &amp; website), and the remainder comes from selling subscriptions to SAAS solutions for businesses. It offers both B2B (Business to business) and B2C (Business to client) solutions.


 Q1 2021 revenue = 55% featured listings, 23% SAAS subscriptions, 22% nearby listings, promoted deals.


 Advertising Breakdown:

1. Futured Listings allows for clients to drive additional traffic to their site through prominent placement on the WM marketplace. Keywords are priced at $0.49 per click which is attractive relative to industry comparisons. This currently accounts for 55% of total MAPS revenue in Q1 of 2021.

2. Nearby listings allow retailers to increase presence in adjacent regions/markets.

3. Promoted deals allows for retailers to showcase discounts and promotions through the MAPS deals page

4. Display advertising allows banners throughout the WM website


 SAAS Business Breakdown:

1. WM Marketplace is the product most are familiar with, which consists of the companys website and Android/IOS apps.

2. WM Pages is a listing page with product menu where clients can also provide license information, hours of operation, contact info, discount policies, and other information.

3. WM Orders provides reservation of products for pickup or delivery which allows retailers to confirm availability of products, complete orders, and process payments. (The latter two occurring outside of WM listings marketplace)

4. WM Dispatch is logistics and fulfillment software that allow for real-time routing for legally compliant delivery and tracking of product.

5. WM Retail is a retail point-of-sale system providing inventory management and compliance reporting functionality. The POS system is integrated with WM Pages and WM Orders.

6. WM Dashboard provides data analytics. More specifically, it provides insight on user data and traffic trends on a clients listing page.

7. WM Store is an orders and menu embed that allows retailers to import their listing menu or WM orders to their own white-labeled WM store website or external third party site. This allows retail businesses to manage their online presence, inventory, and compliance workflows on the WM website and separately branded sites. This does not include product availability confirmation, final order entry, order fulfillment, or payment processing solutions.

8. WM Exchange provides access to the online wholesale exchange allowing retailers to explore brand catalogs and identify wholesalers in order to obtain inventory and manage customer relationships and wholesale operations. Additionally, this solution offers compliance features such as invoice and transportation manifest generation and recordkeeping. WM Exchange is presently available in California, Oklahoma, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri, and Maine with future plans for expansion as allowed.


2. Competition:

Competition such as Leafly, Dutchie, and others only target specific products that WM Holdings offers. While Leafly enjoys the same amount of Monthly Active Users, MAPS appears to be monetizing at a higher rate with a targeted audience more weighted on the west coast.


Competition does not provide all of the same business solutions, but most importantly, do not offer a marketplace which differentiates WM. The companys competitive advantage is quite simple in that it provides a wholistic and comprehensive approach for the cost, compared to any technology solution provider in the industry, which provides more value. Additionally, they provide retailers compliance tools which is a key competitive advantage.


The companys time in the industry has positioned it well for post-legalization/decriminalization. They have been spearheading lobbying and legalization efforts which will benefit them.


JNP provided the following information from 5 customer relationships

 100% of WM customers indicated low odds of switching vendors

 100% of WM customers picked WM over the competition due to performance

 100% of WM customers also evaluated Leafly

 80% of WM customers indicated spending with WM would increase in the next 12 months


3. Legalization Trends:

People always talk about how this industry is highly regulated, which is pretty obvious, but also doesnt mean much at the same time for a company that isnt touching product directly. As a SAAS company, WM Holdings doesnt directly touch product, thus they are not regulated in the same sense as a grower/retailer. (Does Square fall under food handling regulations and risks? Does Grubhub? No! They simply service the industry) 


Additionally, CEO Chris Beals has indicated the company will never ger involved with direct handling the product due to the headache of risk and compliance on city, county, and state, and federal levels. This insulates the company from the industry as a service company. Its also the hurdles Amazon has to overcome if they want to ship the product.


It is important to note that the DOJ withdrew its prior subpoena and does not intend to pursue further investigation into the matter. In September 2019, WM Holdings received a grand-jury subpoena from the DOJ which was related to the companys prior listing of unlicensed dispensaries. The company had conducted a business reset to delist illicit or non-licensed retailers, similar to what it has done in Canada.


 Present trends are favorable for the legal environment with the most recent development being a GOP sponsored bill for a way forward on the federal level. This is huge since this is the first time the GOP has been willing to discuss a path forward. For the last decade, the same bills have been proposed only to die in the senate. This has changed, and both sides are at least open to discussion.

 Prior top justice officials from the DOJ (highest ranking law officials in the nation) have discussed the great potential of legalization, and their expectations of this occurring. This information is available online via news articles.

 The supreme court, while it did not directly rule on legalization, Justice Thomas in his dissent in June 2021 questioned the listing as a sch. 1 substance while every attorney general over the last decade or so saying they would not enforce. He stated that this was inherently contradictory, and Justice Thomas questioned the point of even listing it as an illicit substance when enforcement was not followed through on.

 Recent studies have shown that the majority of US adults now favor legalization for both medical and recreational use. Record breaking tax revenue and product usage was reported in 2020, with trends indicating increase in these areas. This has led states sitting on the sidelines to now become interested in their own way towards legalization.

 While there is concern about Amazon or Google competing upon federal movement forward, this seems doubtful based on current proposed legislation, and managements prior comments. The company isnt getting into logistics due to the headache of compliance. Additionally, so far proposed legislations on both sides restrict advertising, which is in WMs favor, and will prevent Google or Facebook from competing. Amazon has made political contributions for lobbying efforts, however given the size of Amazon and their historical donations, this doesnt seem as serious as it could be.


4. Valuation Assumptions:

Many of the price target estimates are based on unrealistic conditions that penalize the stock.  This also includes the companies initial guidance projections which did not include recently legalized states. Many do not include 2020 election results or subsequent legalization that has taken place. Many also ignore any future legalization whatsoever for base case discussion and apply arbitrary industry discounts as high as 20%, because they claim that investors are too worried to invest in MAPS due to cannabis risk, thus investment supply is short. 


I find this laughable, considering I do not see any cannabis related risks to this company. They do not handle the product directly, the DOJ dropped its subpoena, and if there was any period to be concerned it was the companys first 8-year from 2008-2016 when California had yet to even legalize with Prop 64. For MAPS to be in trouble, their dispensary or retail clients would have to go under. 


 Piper Sandler Base Case scenario of a $50bln US market assumes no regulatory changes, and no further legalization is achieved through 2030.

 Key Assumptions for some of the analysists assume no new states legalizing in 2021-2022, new states tricking in 2023 and onwards, and no federal legalization through 2030.

 Arbitrary industry discounts such as 20% due to industry risks. Many of the analysts utilize 15%-16% discounts.



Conclusion:


I see this company as the leading SAAS for the cannabis industry. It has us consistent performance and has gained a lot of experience over the years, but its gross profit margins are insane. I have yet to see a cannabis related company achieve their same metrics (MAPS is quasi-cannabis in my mind since it is a service company). 


Acquisition of Sprout for its client relationship management functionality is a positive sign in my opinion. Theyre positioning to take advantage of states that are legalizing ahead of the curve.


MAPS has no risk in terms of regulation. The DOJ dropped its subpoena, and there is no more risk on that front. They do not handle cannabis directly they simply provide software solutions and advertising solutions to the industry.


Cannabis product differentiation doesnt really exist. Its similar to produce, you dont buy fruits and vegetables because of loyalty to the farm that grew them (unless you know some farmers personally), because there is no differentiation between end user products. As such, growers are price takers. This makes them reliant upon MAPS as consumers have no brand loyalty to cannabis products. Traffic to dispensaries tends to be by foot, and convenience. MAPS benefits here since consumers use their listing services to find what the hell is nearby. MAPS has dominated the fractured California market because of the lack of brand recognition, and I anticipate them doing the same elsewhere due to their favorable client ratings. Clients even admit even though they arent the cheapest they provide the most value, especially with their assistance with legal compliance.


Additionally, no one else can really compare to what MAPS is offering. No one is providing vertically integrated solutions on the same scale, and in a manner that communicates across products. MAPS products work with one another and provide a lot of data points to wholesale and retail operations. This will put maps ahead of the competition who compete on a smaller scale against specific products. With MAPS dominance, its hard for businesses to leave. Their products are sticky and the more a retailer has, the harder it is to leave. They arent even monitoring their database yet.


The companys unique strengths combined with their profitability and growth are material to me. Their monthly average users, and average clients are increasing quarter over quarter. Sales continue to increase as well. 


Everyone recently panicked over expectations of a single quarter yet to be realized. FYE 22 is projected to still be profitable, and I think its ridiculous to freak out over a single quarter for a company with so much potential. This hasnt made the company insolvent or illiquid, they are very much liquid and capable of further growth and M&amp;A. As far as Im concerned their prospects are unchanged. 


It is important however, from a stock price perspective to keep in mind warrant dilution. Once the stock is $18 for 20/30 days that could impact shares. I dont know what the impact will be. I have heard rumors about the shares being in short supply based on the initial offering, and how many insiders own them. Although I cannot substantiate it, what I heard was that if there was a huge run in this stock the low float would drive up the price. I cant speak to this, the YouTube video is no longer posted from what I can see. 


However, I do recall hearing about notable short interest on this stock. Ive seen a lot of large volume after hours purchases, especially around the $12-$14 range. This stock typically runs on low volume. It has done so with the exception of 11/12/21. 4K shares driving the price up/down a lot. $12 was the floor of resistance for a long time and anytime it fell below it would shoot back up. Seemed to bounce between $12-$15 range for a long time. No idea if this helps, just my personal observations. I believe any price under $15 is solid, anything under $12 is killer. Considering the current price is hovering above $9, and warrant strike price is $11.50, Id say its a hell of a deal right now, just in time for Black Friday.

We can't argue against fast food workers making $20/hr until we stop paying these ape analysts on TV six figures. Especially when they cause others to lose money.

Inflation increases by 0.1% every time it's mentioned in the news.

The TV show Dexter returned last week. Dexter looks like an ape.

Nancy Pelosi looks like an ape, but she is the queen.

1,"11/13/2021, 07:32:47",Why $IONQ is going to $70 EOM,The_OG_Steve," Institutional ownership has increased 3x in the last few months. A majority of PIPE shareholders are locked until March 2022, an estimated 8.5 million shares which is around 22% of shares outstanding. Factoring the amount of insider ownership and the recent 3x in Institutional Holdings we could safely assume that nearly 50% of the shares outstanding are not moving for a while.

Look at the chart and notice the similarities between the QS and IONQ charts before QS proceeded to rip a 3x. They may be in different fields but they are very similar in how QS was the first pure SS battery play while IONQ is the first Quantum Computing play we have. If it follows the fractal as i see, we should see IONQ trading at 70$ in 3 weeks.

1,"11/13/2021, 06:03:28",Home Depot: a house of pain?,OrcaBull,"**Thesis: $HD is reporting Q3 earnings next week and I am betting that it won't impress.** Lockdown DIY fad is dying. Housing sales &amp; renovations are not as hot as before. Inflation is eating into the margins. Supply chain disruptions is affecting inventory. Some contractor and manual laborers are finding other jobs in the red hot jobs market. $HD has a tendency to drop after earnings. 

**Caution:** This is a long shot trade with **13.5% odds** of working according to options market. My previous [DDs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr2i8y/beyond_meat_a_nothing_burger_that_costs_63b/) worked out great but that doesn't mean that this will. Be ready to lose it all if you make this trade. This post is not advice or research report. I bought call spreads worth $19k. Buying further in the money (370/360 bear put) would have been more conservative. The following is my position: 

https://preview.redd.it/7frg0tsmj8z71.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa584552c8f960a180f9427bf92bb52a4b5a0f9

**Point 1:** A lot of DYI happened because people working from home looked around their homes and noticed defects and had time to fix them. For this they needed tools and had to restock their tool boxes. Also Home Depot was allowed to stay open when other stores were forced to close. These are trends for ""DIY"": 

https://preview.redd.it/33c1mfdfc8z71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2ef74658c18798f9a2c7a8fded192cb394382e

**Point 2:** There are two charts that will follow. Existing home sales (seasonally adjusted) shows that number of units sold are pretty low for this summer. 

https://preview.redd.it/ks3niuame8z71.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26d5cbcac4a43bcf9799b62fdc25be9af377a7d9

Note that this is seasonally adjusted, so it compares it to previous years. To put things in perspective you can see housing inventory below 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tvn619mze8z71.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=986ec49bb96328d0edba6d87a4036bc9b9111c4b

From the two charts you can glean that even though prices are high there aren't enough sellers. House flippers are sitting on their inventory because they make more money from holding the house instead of flipping it when renovation costs are high and you have an appreciating asset. This lack of motivation from house flippers is not good for Home Depot. 

**Points 3,4,5 need no evidence.** Turn on any news outlet and they will talk at nauseum about Inflation, Supply chain disruptions, and labor market. 

**Point 6:** See the chart below:

I think we have the same opportunity here with PDFI in the decentralized finance industry. It's an industry people expect to grow by more than 10X in the next 5 years.  Hedge funds are throwing their money into Defi, [47 percent of  traditional hedge fund managers have invested or are looking into defi](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-hedge-funds-show-growing-000000124.html). Usually us plebs can't make access these hedge funds and their crazy gains but now we can through PDFI. PDFI bought layer 2, which is active in DeFi. They recently bought a sixeable posittion with a defi protocol named Impermax. As a defi investor, believe me when I tell you, Impermax is heavily undervalued. The fact that Layer 2 is looking at these sorts of projects is a HUGE green flag. If PDFI continues to fund this sort of activity I will continue to buy this stock as it's one of the few ways to own Defi on the stock market.

For those that followed up on that DD, you guys already know the options contracts on oil -- XOP -- went up upwards of a 1000% in the weeks following.Maybe it was pure coincidence, maybe I have a crystal fucking ball or maybe I just READ THE NEWS &amp; THE SEXY CHARTS.

**What the fuck is $WOOF?**$WOOF is the pet supplies retailer, Petco. They've been around since the 60s and they have over 1,500 locations. I'm not going to bore you with details of what this company does or how it makes its money. But they monetize EVERY aspect of pet ownership, from selling pets, pet supplies &amp; even offering veterinary &amp; training servicesIf you're not already familiar with what they do, you can check out their website [here](https://www.aspca.org/about-us/press-releases/new-aspca-survey-shows-overwhelming-majority-dogs-and-cats-acquired-during).

**Now, the money fucking making PART**.We all know that dogs are fucking awesome and that should be reason enough for us to load on these sexy shares. But besides that totally valid and sufficient reason to invest your hard earned money on a companyNEWSFLASH, there was a fucking pandemic and it's on its way out. And what happened during the pandemic? people got lonely and they got pets, LOTS &amp; LOTS OF PEOPLE got pets. In fact pet ownership rose to an [all-time high](https://www.petfoodindustry.com/articles/10325-new-us-pet-ownership-study-confirms-pandemic-led-growth).ANOTHER NEWS FLASH. When you get a pet you have to take care of said pet. Not just during the pandemic, but throughout the life of the pet. It's not just a show on NETFLIX that you get bored of and stop watching. And there's more good news! people did not get bored of their pets. The MAJORITY of newly acquired dogs and cats during the pandemic are [still in their homes](https://www.petfoodindustry.com/articles/10325-new-us-pet-ownership-study-confirms-pandemic-led-growth).

This is his account and his opinion.  I simply compiled all the posts from him this morning into one area to make it easier for me to read....thought other may like to see it as well.

$POAI @Transparent_Traders @Snuts@Regan_Proxy 

I think I discovered POAI's next move. Due diligence included. Prediction: POAI &amp; Cvergenx Inc will bring Genomic Adjusted Radiation Dose (GARD) technology to the commercial market through entry of Temporally Feathered Radiation Therapy (TFRT) into clinical trials in late 2021 or early 2022. TRFT aims to reduce radiation toxicity, increasing the quality and length of life of patients without decreasing the effect of the radiation on cancerous tissue. would be the first step into personalized medicine for clinical radiation oncologists. It is likely that PR of a promising new cancer treatment on the fast track into clinical trials being brought to the masses by a publicly listed company like POAI would be pretty big. Due Diligence includes USTPO filings, publications in peer reviewed medical journals, public events surrounding the announcement of said publications, and the activity of POAI in the context of all these variables.

1. September 15th, 2021, POAI brings Raymond Vennare (Ray) on as a new board member. Ray is currently the CEO &amp; Chairman of Cvergenx Inc. (CV), a privately held genomic informatics company. 

2. CV is patent holder to GARD (2020-04-23) a. Jacob Scott, MD, DPhil and Javier Torres-Roca, MD are listed as the inventors of the patent held by CV and hold the intellectual property rights of GARD. 

3. August 4th, 2021: The Lancet Oncology publishes the results of Dr. Scotts work, with early indications being statistical significance in genomic radiation therapy in reducing radiation toxicity. a. Several articles will be listed at the end that came out in response to this, showing big interest in the field, and a generally positive sentiment from their peers. B. In in general most press I found was positive. Including the Cleveland Cancer Center, The Moffit cancer Center  

4. August 18th: POAI passes its charter amendment

5. August 19th: POAI goes dark, announcing nothing after the shares were authorized, creating levels of saltiness amongst its shareholders the world has never seen, and motivating a simple bagholder like myself to go full sleuth as to what is going on.

6. September 4th Dr. Scott and Dr. Torres-Rocca disclosed equity positions in CV as part of an interview with M. Alexander Otto on mdedge.com/ (Global Academy for Medical Education) 

7. September 15th SEC Filings and a post rom Ray Vennars personal LinkedIn page announce his board position with POAI 

8. This was the last time Ray had any activity on LinkedIn to this day (November 12th). .
 
9. September 20th, 2021: Cleveland Clinic publishes results from the first in human trials using GARD technology, endorsing the procedural application of TFRT in a clinical setting, a necessary step prior to beginning clinical trials. Dr. Scott hints at full trials in the article.

10. October 13th, 2021: POAIs twitter goes live for the first time in a month announcing Rays move to the board. 

11. October 19th: The website for Helomics (POAI Subsidiary) is updated but no official PR is released, increasing the salinity of its shareholders to dead sea levels. 

12. October 22nd: Dr. Scott makes the following statement during an interview on another medical publication website: 

13. Healio: What are the next steps? 

a. Scott: Im working to get this incorporated into clinical trials at my institution. We also are working with a large genomics company to make this commercially available, and were hoping that will happen either later this year or early next year. Were hoping treating physicians are going to be able to order this test very soon from a commercial, trusted genomics vendor.

To summarize all that: 
 Dr. Scott holds the intellectual rights to GARD and has equity in CV 
 Ray owns CV , POAI adds Ray to their board within 6 weeks of Dr. Scotts work being published in the Lancet 
 Ray goes dark after the SEC filing and POAI disappears from the public space at the same time. 
 During this period of radio silence Dr. Scotts work starts to cycle through the medical community being peer reviewed several time 
 Dr. Scotts TFRT is deemed feasible for clinical trials at the procedural level, clearing the path for true clinical trials. This is right around the time to all of the highly unusual price action started happening. Darkpool transaction, stop loss raids, clear manipulation of the stock was occurring that was very uncharacteristic.  Within 1 month of this Helomics updates its website.
3 days after that website launched Dr Scott confirms his team is working with a large genomics company to help bring this product to market. To me, thats the smoking gun. So how does Helomics fit into this process? Understanding that each tumor has its own unique genetic signature, and each signature will be more or less receptive to different doses of radiation, Helomics will provide the Radiation Sensitivity Index to clinicians to administer treatments based off of their findings. Helomics currently offers several different assays and historically has offered them for a long time. They havent sold many of them, but they are proficient in making and optimizing them. So it is no stretch of the imagination to see how Helomics could provide exactly the type of tumor assay necessary in determining the genetic profile needed for an accurate RSI needed in GARD based technologies.
This is all opinion and I could absolutely be wrong. I'm not a day trader, a scientist, or a medical professional. Just a disgruntled shareholder who wants to put all the pieces together and share with other shareholders.

*The company is a multilevel marketer of nutritional products. Their flagship product is the Nrf-2 Synergizer Protandim. It contains turmeric, a well know anti-inflammatory. Anecdotally, an elderly family friend has become an absolute evangelical for turmeric supplementation and appreciates Protandim very much as he credits turmeric with resolving his chronic arthritis developed during his long career as an electrician.*

**Fundamentals: Bargain Stock!**

$96m market cap on the NASDAQ at $7.28 per share (last trade)

$19.9 million cash and 0 debt

$13 million annual free cash flow and net income runrate

FCF completely plowed back into the stock.

Repeated add-up to repurchase authorization to bulk up the buyback.

**Undervalued at $90M vs $294M DCF Result**

According to DCF at 13M FCF, 5% discount and 1% growth rate, [as depicted here](https://ibb.co/MfKjjDG)

**Catalyst**

Mechanically the stock has a relatively low float, shares are recorded as Hard To Borrow at my major broker, and shares are being aggressively bought back by the company each quarter.

13.5m shares outstanding from 14.1M the quarter before (no float to speak of)

**10.13%**% of Shares Held by All Insiders

**41.57%**% of Shares Held by Institutions

Insitutions include Rennaisance Technologies and Blackrock, among numerous other well known buy and hold names, so there's not a lot of shares expect to come onto the market.

So the baseline catalyst is buybacks and continuing solidly profitable business operations are intact.

1,"11/13/2021, 03:52:27",Would you like to buy Alibabas Chinese e-commerce business for less than $10 per share?,abasoglu,"Alibaba has been battered so much that its core business is now valued at less than $10 per share. That might sound ridiculous considering that business is still growing and generating copious amounts of cash flow. But its also true.

Now, how did I get to that number?

I started at Alibabas market cap and then started to back out all its other major businesses. So, lets start by listing these businesses along with a rough estimate of their values.

\- AliBaba Cloud is the companys answer to Amazons AWS business and arguably its future growth engine. The company grew its revenue by 50% to $9.4 billion for Alibabas FY2021. Its hard to break out a valuation for Alibaba Cloud on its own but Salesforce might be a reasonable comparison. The company generated $21.3 billion in revenue for its FY2021 and has a market value of $296 billion. Accordingly, its reasonable for AliBaba Cloud to be valued at **roughly $100 billion** after adjusting for size and taking a China discount.

\- Ele.me is s an online food delivery service platform and Alibabas direct competitor to Meituan. Ele.me has a 30.9% market share of the Chinese food delivery market versus Meituans 67.3%. Meituans current market value is $227 billion based on its Hong Kong listed shares. Based off that, Ele.me would command a valuation of roughly $104 billion  rounded down to **$100 billion**.

\- Lazada is Alibabas mini-me for southeast Asia. It dominates some of the countries in the region like Thailand and Malaysia while remaining competitive in the others with its regional rival Shopee (owned by SEA Limited). SEA Limited has a market value of $184 billion but its business also include gaming and a finance arm. A reasonable approximation of Lazadas value would be around **$80 billion** based off of SEA Limiteds valuation.

\- Alipay is the companys fintech arm. However, Alibaba only retains a 33% interest in the company. Before Alipay got in trouble, the company was heading for a $300 billion IPO. Those days are long gone but Alipay continues to grow and make money according reports. The most recent reports Ive seen mention that Alipays value in a potential future IPO would have its valuation slashed to a third or about $100 billion. Alibabas portion of that would be $33 billion  lets round down to **$30 billion**.

\- Cainao is Alibabas logistics arm. Alibaba owns a 63% stake in the company. This is a difficult one to estimate as there isnt a comparable company out there but the company was valued at around $20 billion back in 2018. The value of this company has only gone up from there as the pandemic has driven up demand for logistic services. I wouldnt be surprised if Alibabas stake is worth **$30 billion**.

\- Trendyol is Turkeys dominant e-commerce site. Alibaba owns an 87% stake in the company. Trendyols most recent funding valued the company at $16.5 billion  or roughly **$15 billion** for Alibabas stake.

\- Youku is one of China's top online video and streaming service platforms. Alibaba bought the company out in 2016 for $4 billion. Id say a rough value of the company now is **$10 billion**.

\- Sun Art is principally engaged in the operation of hypermarkets and e-commerce platforms in China. Alibaba owns a 72% stake thats worth roughly **$3 billion** at current market value of the companys HK listed shares.

\- Last but not least, Alibaba has **$57 billion** of cash and short-term investments net of debt.

All of the above pieces add up to hefty $426 billion. Alibabas current market cap is roughly $450 billion these days. So, youre left with a paltry **$24 billion** valuation for Alibabas core e-commerce businesses (that includes Taobao, TMall, AliExpress and Alibaba.com).

Or to put it another way, youre buying those businesses for **$8.89 per share** (Alibaba has 2.7 billion shares outstanding). Thats a deal of a lifetime and why I remain bullish on Alibaba.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsjasm/would_you_like_to_buy_alibabas_chinese_ecommerce/

The EPS is expected to be $-0.22 which I believe will start somewhat of a scare and cause the stock price to go down a significant amount. The stock is without a doubt overvalued based off the recent news of their mileage which was only actually applied to the less than half a dozen cars they sold this year.

Thoughts of Higher demand. Lower supply. Twitter thinks strong on the stock, If we get that Covid talk again. Some bulls believe Coffee prices will sky rocket. **NuZee, Inc**. is a specialty coffee company. The Companys primary focus is the development of single serve pour over coffee in the North American market targeting the individual consumer for use at home and office or other settings that would benefit from single serve pour over products and it is a commercial-scale co-packer of single serves pour over coffee products. 

Interesting with [**$NUZE**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NUZE&amp;src=cashtag_click) news yesterday and some analyst charts holding well in the $4s. From what we see on Etrade the stock is still trading at 100%+ from pre news Levels (sub $2).   Twitter bulls are telling us to keep an eye on this commodity...... **THOUGHTS??**  

In addition, the Company is continually exploring partnerships, co-ventures, and mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions with existing and future business partners to generate additional business, reduce manufacturing costs, expand into new markets, and further penetrate the markets in which the Company operates.

Most people will say they are losing revenu and market. 1) No Recent Tech IPO is profitable, they need money to grow and the IPO provide that money those high growth company needs. 2) Wish lost market share, howerver they are implementing a lot of correction before squeezing the ads for the whole entreprise to be profitable. Still, 90 users on a stock that is pretty much woth 1 Year sale is insane, My Target is 30+ in 2022. 

Here is few takeaways after last earning call :

1) 5$ is truly the historical bottom

2) Wish will grow to be a much better profitable company, with better retentention

3) We will see significant quality upgrades on the products in 2022

4) Wish is making deals like there is no tomorrow with a lot of company

 All the steps are in place for a turnover within a year. This is ridiculously undervalued. Top that with a ceo replacement and 243 jobs posting within a month, I would say things are moving in place and someone has a clear plan with this company. You dont hire so much people if you are not planning on growing . Why is the replacement of the CEO important, because it means changes are coming :   if you believe that your company is planning to merge, or has secretly already agreed to merge, and the announcement might not be for several months, then the resignation of key employees can be seen as bullish.  So lets put pieces together. Wish has been posting a lot of executives positions on linked recently. A lot of the management team comes from tech and google.

How is our society not running on hydrogen?

1. Can use renewables for electrolysis. Produces H2 and O2 - both very useful
2. Can store it in tanks and transport it in pipes. (basic infrastructure) I.E. no batteries.
3. When burned it yields pure water.

How is this not the most prevalent way to produce energy? - is there something I'm missing?

If nothing else, the fact that it's broadly held the line since its ER is saying something.

Piotr Szulczewski being removed as CEO screams that the leadership team mean business. The ""old guard"" has gone. 

They're in survival mode, and anyone that has recently joined or will be joining the c-suite will be under no illusions.

$WISH's leadership team is addressing the loud and clear feedback about their current business model and are pivoting. What's more, they have the balance sheet to execute a pivot; it's not too late despite what the bears will tell you. The key areas (at a very high level) of focus are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Increase users' confidence in their marketplace ($WISH Standards)
* Provide a more differentiated and engaging user experience ($WISH Clips)
* Logistics

&amp;#x200B;

So who is this team assembling $WISH's rocket ship?

**Jackie Reses (Executive Chair) -** ***Joined in May 2021***

Formerly Executive Chairperson of Square

She has helped technology, e-commerce, and high growth start-ups launch new products, markets and revenue streams.

Before Square, she was the Chief Development Officer at Yahoo, where she ran partnerships, acquisitions and investments, significant corporate tax transactions, and human resources. She also served on the board of Alibaba Group, where she helped steward the company's transition from a private to a public company.

**Farhang Kassaei (Chief Technology Officer) -** ***Joined in July 2021***

Formerly Senior Director of Software Engineering at Google

He oversaw the development and roll-out of full-stack commerce capabilities across Search, YouTube, Assistant and Local, and Google Express local shopping and delivery products. He also managed the infrastructure enabling Google Product Listing Ads globally.

**Tarun Jain (Chief Product Officer) -** ***Joined August 2021***

Formerly Director of Product Management at Google 

He incubated and led the development of Discovery Ads, bringing inspirational and engaging commercial ad experiences to YouTube, Gmail and Discover. Before joining Google, he served as Senior Director of Product Management and Head of Product (Ads) at Flipkart. He played a crucial role in driving customer growth through a series of personalization and merchandising solutions. He also led the development of several innovative payment solutions, further enhancing business performance.

Tarun Jain also previously served as Group Product Manager for Commerce, Media and Ads at Twitter and Senior Product Manager Lead for the Bing search engine.

**Vivian Liu (Chief Financial Officer) -** ***Joined October 2021***

Formerly served as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Shutterfly.

She played a critical role in helping Shutterfly navigate the pandemic while transforming the business to achieve accelerated topline growth and EBITDA improvement. She re-established the corporate development function, which successfully acquired Spoonflower in 2021, significantly expanding Shutterfly's addressable market. She also focused on driving operational efficiencies, including co-leading the company-wide implementation of an SAP platform.

# In summary

The above hasn't joined the company to simply ""improve"" $WISH, just like Ryan Cohen didn't get involved with $GME to improve GameStop. They've joined to dramatically pivot the company and bring together their past successes to turn this e-commerce platform around.

Most of the c-suite joined in the second half of this year - right in the middle of the shit storm. This is their time to shine; for the company and their careers.

1,"11/13/2021, 02:19:22",$PSFE is a good theta play,forzan,"#What happened

[$PSFE had some particularly shitty Q3 earnings on 11/11](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-reports-third-quarter-2021-115900850.html). Earnings were reported before open, and the stock value nearly halved, from $7.28 -&gt; $4.16  in the first thirty minutes of trading.

#What the fuck is a Paysafe

Paysafe is basically Paypal/Venmo for non-Americans. They sell 'payment processing solutions.' The shit is really boring and you can look at the PDFs on their website if you really care. They're a transaction middle man that sells stuff to businesses for charging money to people, and they have a digital wallet (like Venmo) that they want people to use for transactions. The digital wallet is where they expected most of their revenue growth to come from this year.

#Why earnings sucked

In the earnings report, it looks like they're losing money -- the company listed a net loss of $147.2M. However, that includes a $322.2M loss from the company devaluing their digital wallet business. That means the accountants just decided something they owned was worth less money than the value they originally made up -- so they made up a new number -- and put the difference as a loss on their earnings sheet.

They technically made $106.4M cash profit in Q3. However, the value of their digital wallet business they claimed in previous quarters was actually a complete fugazi. That's spooky shit for investors. But fundamentally, accounting on earnings reports is just smoke and mirrors anyway -- you're stupid if all you're looking at is EPS.

Then, as a fucking cherry on top, the CFO said they're going to make a smaller revenue and profit than they originally planned for at least the next year. (yikes) He did an AMA on Twitter though, and made some solid arguments for why the company could still pull some interesting shit off. (meh)

#Analysis

What you're witnessing on the price drop isn't people running from a company losing money -- $PSFE makes steady profits -- what you're witnessing is investors bailing from what they though was a growth company. The promise of growth dried up.

This isn't a potential downward spiral into bankruptcy like $WISH or $NKLA. It's just a boring company with $1.5B of annual revenue and $400M of annual profits if they don't start flexing harder. Frankly, value is there, and the growth potential still exists (if they get their shit together).

More importantly, the IV is fucking retarded right now because of the drop. You can turn this into a pretty easy theta play by buying a discounted stock and selling covered calls to idiots that think a squeeze is coming.

There is no evidence of this bEiNg AnOtHer ShOrT sQueEze, it's more likely some large institutions bailed when they realized this thing wasn't a growth stock -- and their portfolio required a growth stock. However, if you're a conspiracy theorist, buy and hold I guess.

Greetings, lads. Elons TweetThreats aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following

* Rivian just upsized its IPO. Share price range: $72-74. Projected $65B market cap.
* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,222. Now $1.22T MC.
* Lucid +90% in two weeks. SP $41.80. Now $67.2B MC.

Like you, SoFi didnt fill my $RIVN IPO order this week. Nor did I catch the $LCID $15 dip. And sadly, I wasnt able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years ago.

But heres our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV pure plays in the market:

Polestar  Volvos EV spinoff brand  estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.

Its now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.

Polestar is the only global EV pure play, other than Tesla.



**History**

A little background

* Polestar takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris  not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. Thats *Polstjrnan* (literal translation, Pole Star) if youre Swedish.
* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvos partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.
* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.
* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being independent since 2017.
* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.
* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim SPAC, GGPI.

**Comps**



**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**

* Applying Teslas 2022E multiple (17.2x) to Polestar implies a share price of $27.46. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase of 156.64%.
* Applying Lucids 2022E multiple (29.6x) to Polestar implies a share price of $47.27. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase of 342.78%.



**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**

* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.
* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:

1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).
2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.

* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.
* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.
* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.





**Gores SPACs**

For those new to SPACland, Gores track record speaks for itself



**The EV Graveyard**

The EV SPAC battlefield is littered with bodies (RIDE, WKHS, NKLA).

But Polestar?

They've been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when they IPOd? Answer: 1,400.

Polestar just makes cars, baby.

CEO Thomas Ingenlath: We have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.

Claim confirmed. And look at that jawline.



Polestar estimates 65,000 deliveries in FY22 and revenues in excess of $3B.





**The Product**

The Polestar 1 came out in 2019. Its a hybrid premium sports car that will set you back $155K 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph. Theyre badass, and hard to find.



**Polestar 2**

The Polestar 2 launched in 2020. Polestar 2 What is it?

Think Subaru Outback meets the Model 3  with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic. Its a sedan, but its higher ride- height and rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a hatchback. Lets call it a crossover coupe. Available now.



**Comparison**\*\*: Versus the Tesla Model 3:\*\*

The Polestar 2 compares favorably to the Tesla 3 in both price and range:

**Polestar 2**

MSRP: $47,200

Federal tax credit: -$7,500

Total: $39,700

Range: 265 miles (single-motor base model)

**Tesla Model 3**

MSRP: $43,990

Federal tax credit: Does not currently qualify

Total: $43,990

Range: 262 miles (base model)

**Upcoming Polestar lineup**

* Polestar 3 (2022)  luxury electric SUV built in the USA at Volvos South Carolina factory. Polestar also hopes to have the South Carolina vehicles be union-made no easy task these days (looking at you, Austin Elon).
* Ingenlath (CEO): ""Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American customers. I remember the great response when I first shared Polestar's vision here in the USA and I am proud that our first SUV will be manufactured in South Carolina. From now on, the USA is no longer an export market but a home market.""



* Polestar 4 (2023)  smaller SUV that will exhibit a coupe-like profile and is set to compete with the Porsche Macan and the Tesla Model Y.
* Polestar 5 (2024)  sports sedan inspired by the Precept concept car, competing with the Tesla Model S.

**Political / Regulatory Tailwinds**

The US and global political environment has never been more positive for investment in electric vehicles.

On Saturday morning, the House of Representatives voted 228-206 to pass the Build Back Better infrastructure bill totaling $1.2 trillion. This is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.

Relevant highlights:

* The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.
* Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.
* An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.

**Brand Rollout**

While watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series last week, I saw this TV commercial:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk)

* It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.
* Launched ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human advancement, the way we live now and the damage we're doing to the planet.
* Nyberg: ""Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.

**Whats our boy Cramer at CNBC have to say?**



***Cramer on $GGPI:***

* Theyre connected with Polestar. OK, heres the problem: Rivian is coming public. This group has gotten a little too hot. Lets let things cool off before we get hurt.

Ok, Cramer has a point here, but not necessarily about GGPI. Your downside risk on LCID, TSLA, RIVN is technically limitless.

Your risk on GGPI, since its still a SPAC 7%.

**What does Leo have to say?**



Well, we dont know a lot about Leos investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:

* \[CEO\] Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake DiCaprio \[has\] in the company. One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is sustainability, Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. Its as well very important for Leo. He and us being joined on that journey, him investing in our company, obviously that makes sense for both sides.

1,"11/13/2021, 01:12:58",Why is UBER not valued 3x higher?,Substantial-Issue-61,"1. Gross sales are nearing $100Billion a year and growing.

  \*Weird accounting rules make them report their sales after taking out driver costs.   Thats like walmart reporting their sales after they paid their vendors.  Idiotic.   Their real gross sales are close to $100B annualized.  Probably reach $150B in 23. 

&amp;#x200B;

Comparable huge companies gross sales to market cap:

UBER:    .8 of sales ($100B sales &amp; $85B market cap)   And they have very little capital expenditures. 

Tesla:  20x sales ($45B sales &amp; $1Trillion market cap)  and extremely capital intensive

Nike 6x sales ($45B in sales, $270B market cap).  

Sales Force:   13x sales ($24B sales, $300B market cap). 

etc - almost all of biggest companies in United states are 5x sales or more in terms of market cap. 

&amp;#x200B;

YES, its about cash flow, not sales, but its future cash flows.  For a mature company, today's cash flow is extremely important.  But for a growing company, the sales tell us alot about potential cash flow in the future after they stop growing.   At $150B in sales in a few years, its almost guaranteed that they will make 5-10% profit at a minimum, once they stop growing.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. They just posted first operating profit, so they are starting to show signs of mature company not constant growth because of their CEO. 

3. Their CEO appears to be a badass.

4. They can easily raise prices if driver costs go up, so all the employee classification legal stuff seems irrelevant.

5.Once they stop growing as fast and get through pandemic completely, they should be able to make $10B in profit fairly easily.   25x that is roughly 3x their market cap now.   25x is not out of line for huge company with big brand. What am I missing?   And I think these numbers are semi-conservative.

&amp;#x200B;

Basic calc:

$100B sales -$80B drivers - $10B for overhead = $10billion profit.

$10B for office staff, app development seems extremely high.   Its not like they have any capital expenditures or huge customer service reps, etc.    Don't get it. 

I think their overhead is much higher right now because of continued investment in growth.   Eventually they are going to stop growing as fast and explode in profit.

LG Display ($LPL) is a Korean company and one of the world's largest manufacturers of TFT-LCD and OLED screens for IT devices, computers, mobile devices, and TVs. Although weve been hearing about OLED since 2012, due to drastic reductions in prices we are only starting to see its unanimous replacement of LCD panels now. This breakthrough in consumer pricing will finally allowed LG Display to bear the fruits of its investments in previous years on OLED technology. ***LG Display's current market cap is around $6bil giving them a forward P/E ratio of around 4.53, a P/S ratio of less than 7, and an eps of 1.91. How the fuck do these numbers make any sense? LGD is UNDERVALUED.***

https://preview.redd.it/fp3gftr347z71.jpg?width=222&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3851ec6f189e68abcdd4c569b6de5d7e12131811

""**Demand for OLED panels showed 90 percent growth year-on-year** despite lower demand in the TV sector,"" an LG Display official said during the company's conference after the release of third-quarter earnings, Wednesday.

The OLED market is showing explosive growth regardless of large and small-sized panels. The global sales of large OLED panels exclusively produced by LG Display are expected to exceed 8 million units this year from 4.5 million units last year and 10 million units next year. Worldwide smartphone shipments using OLED displays will also exceed 500 million units this year, **increasing by more than 30% compared to the previous year**. In this regard, LG Display announced in mid-August that it would spend 3.3 trillion won to build a new production line for small and medium-sized 6th generation OLED panels in Paju. LG Display plans to double the production of OLED panels at the Paju plant, which is currently 30,000 sheets per month, to 60,000 sheets by starting the new facility in 2024.

In the automotive OLED display market, the company dominates with 91 percent of the Global automotive OLED market. **Display shipments are estimated to 5x to $264 million by 2023 and $601 million in 2025 from $50 million last year**, according to Omdia. LG Display chose the automotive display business as one of the future growth engines and focuses its investment and development. It produced plastic OLED (P-OLED) panels for vehicles for the first time in 2019 and unveiled an ultra-large display that combines four displays into one T-shape screen and a 12.8-inch rollable product at the Display Week 2021, the world's largest display exhibition hosted by the Society for Information Display (SID). LGD has expanded its supplies to premium vehicle models of global brands like Mercedes-Benz and General Motors. GMs premium 2021 Cadillac Escalade is equipped with LG Displays 38-inch P-OLED display, and Mercedes-Benzs newest S-class model reportedly has a 12.8-inch screen. The infotainment system MBUX for Mercedes-Benz large-sized all-electric EQS lineup also is said to feature LGs panel. LG Displays order backlog is expected to reach around 10 trillion won ($8.95 billion), according to industry sources. It generally takes more than three years to develop and manufacture an automotive OLED display, which prevents new competitors from easily entering the business sector.

1,"11/13/2021, 00:57:12",$ROOTing through the Garbage of 3Q Results,kidicaru59,"**TL;DR**  
$ROOT's 3Q 10-Q is full of garbage and this stock should be headed to $0.   

**ROOT burns cash in everything it does**

Cash flow from operations was -$138mm in 3Q, -136mm in 2Q, and -91mm in 1Q.  Cash at 9/30/21 was $834mm, down from $973mm at 6/30/21, which was down from $1.1bn at 3/31/21.

Where did all this cash go?  Well, to start with, ROOT loses money from its operations. It pays out more money on insurance claim losses than it collects in premiums! In 3Q, ROOT generated $94mm in revenue but had $114mm of losses from insurance claims. Plus it spent another $106mm on sales and marketing expenses and G&amp;A (salaries, rent, etc.). So it spends money on failed marketing campaigns to drive revenue and salaries for its staff. In other words, ROOT loses money on everything it does. Total operating loss was -$127mm. 

And this was the case in 2Q as well. ROOT generated $90mm of revenue but had $110mm of losses from insurance claims.  Plus another $152mm of expenses, for a total operating loss of -$172mm.

Assuming a quarterly cash burn rate of \~$140mm and a 9/30/21 cash balance of $834mm, this means ROOT has 6 quarters of runway left before it becomes insolvent.  Or, assuming it has already burned $70mm of cash through the date of this writing (since we're approximately half-way through Q4), that leaves $764mm of cash as of today and only 5.5 quarters of runway from today.

Would management ever allow the business to run out of cash?  No way.  So how will they continue to fund this cash burning machine?  Issue equity of course, diluting current shareholders.  I anticipate ROOT will announce a share issuance within the next 1-2 quarters.  This will cause the share price to fall immediately.  

Is the company at least growing?  Not consistently, and not enough to make a difference.  In 3Q, revenue grew only 4% sequentially from 2Q.  In 2Q, revenue declined 26% year over year.  In 1Q, revenue declined 45% year over year.  So ROOT is not materially growing, and it actually shrank in revenue in 2 of the last 3 quarters. 

**Special Sauce not working**

ROOT claims it is different because it uses driving performance to set premiums.  It claims to do via its app, used to rate drivers' driving performance. 

https://preview.redd.it/tbl1ioz717z71.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06b1dd35f7397792b20864e6ef1cad98a7bb8026

So what do Daily App rankings tell us about how well ROOT is signing up new customers?  Daily App rankings can be used as a proxy for app downloads.  This chart shows a substantial decline from a peak on Sep 3rd through today.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c1cvtrez07z71.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd675647ceb3c3d127276e1b30f644843bded8b

So if downloads have dropped substantially, then presumably new customer signups are dropping substantially also.  

**Summary** 

ROOT has anemic recent revenue growth, revenue declines in 2Q and 3Q, declining app downloads, and huge cash burn every quarter with only 5.5 quarters of runway remaining. It will likely need to issue equity in 1-2 quarters to fund this mess, causing share price declines.  This company's stock should be worth something closer to $0 until it at least shows positive gross margins.  Huge downside potential.  Yesterday's pop in price makes for a fat and juicy entry price to sell high and cover low.

Hi Apes,

I present to you one of the hidden gems in the market, a stock with a potential squeeze like no other:

**$AGC - ALTIMETER GROWTH CORP** 

We are looking at a 40b valuation merger between AGC and Grab (a dominating SuperApp within the SEA region) that is due by the end of the year. Due to the COVID-19 outlook, short is currently heavily shorted with a short interest float of 38.8% ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/agc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/agc)) 

What makes this thing the next beast in the market is its **breakdown of major holders (**[**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGC/holders?p=AGC**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGC/holders?p=AGC)**)**:

17.77% held by all Insiders

85% held by Institution

103.37% of Float held by Institutions

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers are insane, a close replica of $GME in the past. Shorts are currently trapped by us retail holders - we have been holding the price for the past 2 hours and we seek the power of the Apes to bring this to the moon. Tonight, we force the hands of shorties to cover. This is a battle that we, retail traders, will not lose. Let's teach the hedge funds another lesson.

In the metaverse, buying new clothes and traveling (or teleporting) through space will require almost no primary resources other than a little electricity and a VR headset.

It is interesting to look at [this](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-battle-to-take-on-biogen-can-this-company-pill-rival-aduhelm/)  article, published just days before the CRTX stock crash. Not much has  changed with this Alzheimer's drug company since the article, except the successful target population has been made clear (40% of all Alzheimer's patients vs. the 100% hoped for). 

This week, the company clarified the results again...and the SP was pushed down some more.

We  appear to have a winner, for the population this serves. And assuming each twice-daily pill costs $1.35 and this treatement works for 40% of  Americans with Alzheimers (6.2 million x 40% = 2.48 million), *that is  potential revenue of $2.48 BILLION per year, in the U.S. alone.*

The information gained in Phase 2/3 will inform further precision and yield enhanced results, driving further profit. A confirmation trial will doubtless be granted by the FDA and from the existing basis of information as well as risk levels commensurate with other approved drugs, ultimate approval is a given, IMHO.\*

The enemy likely responsible for the short selling manipulation

The dirty little details

I first found PALI doing deep ftd digging. I screened for low volume, high decline stuff. Stuff that was down to all time lows. I came across at least a dozen or so that have already done runs upward of 50% or more. Even prog was one I found in that list. Usmc too. PALI peaked my interest for having just soooo many ftd's. Way too many for a low float. 2.29 million? That's insane. It's like amc before it ran. And the borrow rate is just stupid high....so when I looked at why the borrow rate could be so high still....I just did the basic math of ftd's being entered at $3.88/share vs todays sp of $2.62. Decline of 67%. Borrow rate always just a few % above the decline. Too coincidental for me. Seems the 20/50ma has a small factor as well Altium really got lucky on their deal with PALI. But if retail catches wind of their plan moreso, it could prove interesting. I suspect that on level 2 data, that buy order for 90k shares or so at $2.59/share is actually Altiums order. Acquiring shares as they punish increases with shorts. Playing it down just to play it up. Word is that Altium will be able to exercise their warrants at whatever average share price is set next week.

The only reason PALI was able to be suppressed friday was it's lack of volume. That new pr dropped, and PALI was taking off. Was climbing to break $3 fast on barely 100k volume. At 1 million to maybe 2 million volume at most, there would be no way in hell Altium could suppress it. So the theory prevails, that if retail does in fact run on PALI, whatever increase is met and held will only increase the warrants cost. Basically, the higher PALI goes, the higher cost to Altium, and the higher the run in PALI for the potential shareholder.

Staddann's RAW NUMBER DD

I've been in this stock since before the merger and the action here is rather strange. What I believe Altium is doing is Warrant Short Sale. Buyer (Altium) holds the right to exercise warrants, but doesn't do so. Instead, they sell short the stock and use the warrants as insurance. So they write certificates against those warrants for shorted shares and also why they can keep the FTD's down as they are cumulative. If you look at the numbers of FTD's especially May 13 (over 2m), that number is ""reset"" the day after. This means they've ""found"" the shares to cover for the FTD's and as mentioned above made certificates against warrants they have the right to exercise later - Look below.

This is from the latest S-3 from July 30.I've put in the ""Edit"" parts for better understanding.

"" Further, the Equity Warrants include a provision such that, beginning six months after the closing of the Merger (Edit: close of merger was April 27. 2021), if the volume weighted average price of Company Common Stock is less than the then-applicable exercise price (Edit: $3.88) for five consecutive trading days, the holder of the Equity Warrant shall be entitled to receive 1.0 share of Company Common Stock for each share underlying the Equity Warrants being exercised thereunder in a cashless exercise. The exercise price and the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Bridge Warrants and Equity Warrants will also be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock splits, dividends or distributions or other similar transactions as well as fundamental transactions.

Prior to the effectiveness of the Waiver and Amendment Agreement (described below), two Resets occurred and the two Bridge Warrants and the Equity Warrants were exercisable for up to 429,446, 429,446, and 5,303,568 shares, respectively, each at an exercise price of $3.88 per share, and two potential Resets remained."" Found on page 6- [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001357459/d0e35ebc-df30-4731-8309-b10aa59c6251.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001357459/d0e35ebc-df30-4731-8309-b10aa59c6251.pdf)

It's easy to understand why Altium would manipulate the stock. So, there you have it. The who, what, where, when, and how PALI is manipulated. Now it lays in retails hands. Will retail push back? Or will predatory hedge funds win?

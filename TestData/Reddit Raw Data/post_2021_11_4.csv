I don't believe anything except the following information which is agreed upon by medical professionals, and spread on the news:

Covid is a flu virus.

Most people are trying to convince everybody to receive the vaccine even though there have been multiple cases of people contracting painful symptoms of covid, after being fully vaccinated.

When fully vaccinated, you can still carry and spread the virus to other people.

So, it seems as though the vaccine does very little. Maybe it offers your immune system some boosted protection against this apparent new flu virus.
I say ""apparent"" because I must base things upon what I see, what I experience. And for the last 2 years, I have never once been ill or sick. I am somewhat reclusive and naturally germaphobic and so my normal lifestyle is quiet healthy compared to the cooped up unhealthy human masses. 
I do not know anybody personally who has been in a bad way due to covid. I know a few people who claim to have had covid, and they reported the symptoms as mild enough, likened to that of a flu. Nothing so terribly fearful as the news, who has been raging on about covid for the last 2 years, makes it seem.

Most of the people I know are vaccinated. 

I am not vaccinated because I want to mind my own business and be left alone. I don't want to go into the people and get injected with a new drug/medicine/vaccination that some people have invented in the last 2 years. I am aware of the process of new drug trials such as observing the long term effects which can only be determined by actually observing the long term effects. So, I guess most of the global population is now a lab rat. 

Whenever I have asked the internet questions such as this one before about covid, I am met with an army of essentially internet trolls, these self righteous people spewing hate unto me for not being vaccinated. Their sentiment toward me is that I am an ignorant selfish troll who is trying to cause something on the internet due to even asking such a question, for questioning the actions of this whole ordeal. They seem to think that I am some sort of anti-vaxer radical. But, it seems to me that they are the radicals of the opposite end of the spectrum. The promote a ""shut the fuck up and just get vaccinated, idiot"" type mentality. But I am on the fence you see. The only reason I am even asking these questions is because now I wish to go abroad to Spain or so for a week. And seemingly, I am required to traverse many hurdles if I wish to have a simple holiday. Hurdles such as paying for 2 covid tests, one going and one returning. I would also have to fill out these strange applications or forms or so from the ministry in Spain. This is all very inconvenient and strange to me. 

And I notice that fully vaccinated people can freely travel through some countries, I believe from Ireland to Spain and back freely without having to endure the pain of paying, with time and money, for multiple covid tests. I don't understand this, because fully vaccinated people can be carriers of the virus and they can also even be I'll with covid itself. So, this furthers my bedazzlement about the requirements of this modern world, the medicinal hurdles we are legally bound to meander if we wish to live conveniently.

I can understand both perspectives of the argument whether all is normal, such as the Spanish flu or other natural epidemics of the past, and I can sympathize with those folk afraid the something sinister is happening in the background, a new social order being tested slowly but surely, as the world heats up, literally, citizens may need to be aligned in the interests of the longevity to humanity. But I refrain from getting too involved in what others tell me, their secondary information, and I also keep to the shallows of the conspiracy theories. I prefer instead to live my personal life as alone as possible, and to base my beliefs about reality on primary information gathered by mine own eyes.

1,"11/04/2021, 23:41:27",TSLA is valued fairly,Wowowiwa69,"I think people misunderstand TSLAs valuation. Every post thats complaining and moaning about how crazy Teslas valuation is simply misses the most important points: 

1) its a subscription company. Tesla offers paid services in their cars. The premium connectivity package that cost $10 per month. With current production rate if 1 million EVs and 1.5 million next year, Teslas revenue will increase significantly not just through selling cars but also through the premium connectivity subscriptions. Moreover, the FSD capability is also going to be under the subscription model which will cost $199/month, according to electrek. 

(https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/?_gl=1*185lamx*_ga*YW1wLWZkZ01jdFNRT25KRXk4NjlYVjRLMEJUV2RPWDRkYjU4TG9tRDAyUDFZWWJ2RFVLT3NKRGlDeE1adklPZzlfc04.)

In technical terms, with estimated 40 million Teslas on the road by the end of this decade, that will add up to a shit ton of money that comes from software subscriptions. 

A good case scenario is this: (40,000,000) cars x ($210 monthly fee) x 12 months = shit ton of money/annual revenue. (Or $100.8 Billion annually.) 

2) its a utility company. Imagine being GM and owning most gas stations around the US. Tesla has the biggest and best charging network in the world that is only getting bigger and better. It is also opening up to other EVs which will have a subscription option or a higher one time payment option. And that already works today. 

(https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-hyundai-ioniq-mach-e-test-video/) 

Also, not to mention the actual utility business of solar and power wall, which papa Musk mentioned that it will be as big of a business as their car business. And we do see evidence of that too. 

( https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-solar-and-energy-storage-business-rakes-in-810m-finally-exceeds-cost-of-revenue/) 

That being said, supply shortage is the biggest problem, but its just a matter of time before it is solved. 

3) Its a Dojo company. The Dojo project is a mind blowing supercomputer which will be at the core of Teslas growth. The supercomputer that makes every Tesla the superior car. If there is a future with on demand robo taxis, it is one that as of now only Tesla is able to create. Monetary value will come in a form of subscriptions, licensing to other car makers, or direct to consumers. Either way, that by itself is worth a SHIT TON of money. 

4) its an Elon Musk company. Daddy Musk doesnt fail - dont bet against him. 

Conclusion: Tesla will be worth much more in the future and it doesnt take a genius to see that. You could probably double or triple your money with Tesla within 5 years even if you bought the stock today.
 
TLDR: Tesla is aight. s should stop moaning, and start thinking logically.

Pinterest reports earnings today. The stock has already been beaten down a lot after last earnings and the failed PayPal acquisition rumor. However, I think their data looks really weak and theres some space for a further drop. Its a dangerous play however, since Pinterest already dropped something like 25% during their last earnings call. Proceed with caution.

Analysts will be watching Pinterests user number very closely. If they dont manage to reverse the MAU drop they experienced during the last earnings call, things could still get uglier. 

**Weak website hits**

In every single one of the countries its active in, Pinterest has suffered a drop in website views since April. The biggest drops came from European countries, but US suffered as well. In October, views were basically steady from September, and the biggest drops came during the month of June, with Q3 being slightly more stable m-o-m.

**Weak app downloads**

App downloads also have decreased a lot, with steady decreases across 2021, and also a pretty sudden recent drop. The pattern kind of reminds me of Wish, which had a similar sudden drop in app downloads, right before they announced during earnings that they were halting marketing aimed at new customers. Not saying Pinterest will suffer a similar fate, but its notable how its rankings are at an extremely low level compared even to pre-pandemic levels.

Hello all you lovely people, I've been kinda following this whole shabang off and on for the past year or so.

I want to start buying in, but the rate I'll be able to do so seems insignificant at best.

I'd be able to buy like a share per month at the current price.

So I guess my questions are:
Is it too late for that to be worth it?
Would it be better for me to save a lot and buy in bulk? 
What does the recent news released this morning mean in monke terms?

Haven't really posted here but I've been realizing lately that I have everything to be grateful for from you guys and haven't given much back. So - here goes: 

I've been trading this Melvin short basket all year - quite literally since I heard the name Melvin back in November 2020 or so. Here's why - I'm too cautious of an options trader to put massive $$$ at risk like you apes. So I always take the more asymmetric bets which for me meant buying the OTM calls on the lower IV members of the Melvin Portfolio betting that if GME spiked, these names would spike also. 

Here is a list of names later officially shown to be part of the Melvin short position:
https://imgur.com/XZcsPh4

Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571821001081/

You can do you own analysis by simply looking at the daily charts of any of these names YTD:

* GME - Gamestop
* BBBY - Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
* HELE - Helen of Troy
* IRBT - iRobot Corp
* MAC - Macerich
* FIZZ - National Beverage (LaCroix)
* SKT - Tanger Outlets
* UNFI - United Foods

And in my personal opinion, some additional names that I *believe* but have no proof to be part of the portfolio are: 

* GSX (Symbol change to GOTU) - Gaotu Techedu
* REV - Revlon

Asset correlation matrix shows a decidedly positive but not perfectly exact mirror of movements between all these - and that's to be expected because Apes weren't gamma squeezing all of these - just mostly GME &amp; BBBY.

https://imgur.com/r4ryB9Y

So - what I'm telling you is I believe this theory is completely correct. Why was the GME squeeze so significant this week? Because BOTH BBBY had buyback news and sent that +100% from 16-&gt;32 as well as SKT had earnings same day and announced a special dividend which sent an otherwise completely quiet stock +20% in a day. 

These is purely my opinion, my speculation, and not trading advice. 
Currently, the only positions that I have are 2 shares of GME on ComputerShare.

(I use the Trade Journal on TraderSync to aggregate since I have active broker relationships with Interactive Brokers, TastyTrade, Ameritrade, Robinhood, and Webull)
Here is my returns from trading against the Melvin portfolio so far this year:

\- 5x revenue is cheap for a tech company growing revenue by 30% year, but only if its losing money. EBIX has had a healthy profit margin for years, ewww, it should stay at 1x revenue. Stick with DASH (24x revenue), they bleed plenty of cash and people will definitely order food from their basement forever.

\- Their fast-growing EBIX cash business is becoming a household name in India and is going to spin off and IPO on the Bombay stock exchange. Which doesnt really matter because theres not that many Indians left and they eek by on casino money.

\- Their CEO looks like he spends most of his time on r/wallstreetbets

1,"11/04/2021, 23:08:48",Don't let reddit make you think gamers give a fuck about scandals. ATVI is ripe.,Avbjj,"ATVI has taken a serious dip recently, down 15% over the past few days and down 14% over the year when even the most retarded of companies have post massive gains from the Covid resurgence.   


But don't let that fool you. As the wise philospher Giacomo Aprile Jr. once said, ""Her body is mad ripe. She's creamin' for me, bro.""   


Activision Blizzard still holds some of the biggest properties in gaming. Lets look at 3 of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Call of Duty** \- Cod is still a money making machine. Warzone itself earns over $5 million per day in microtransactions and as of september, it boasted the highest growth in players over the past 12 months over any game. With a new CoD game on the horizon and as Xbox Series X and PS5 sales continue to ramp up, more and more people are going to continue to play. Especially a F2P game like Warzone. A mobile version of the game is guaranteed at this point and that will only increase it's money making potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Candycrush -** I know what you're thinking. Who the fuck still plays Candycrush in 2021? Well, the answer is a fuckload of people actually. Candycrush has seen 290 million users this year compared to 270 million in 2020. And 2020 boasted the franchises highest revenue at 1.2 billion. This dumb Bejeweled clone is a fucking mobile juggernaut.   


**World Of Warcraft** \- Wow is Activision-Blizzards well honed machine. It's still the most popular MMO by far, and still boasts about 30 million subscribers. Rumors of it's demise are greatly exaggerated. Wow Classic shows that people still have a deep connection to the game and it still generates plenty of healthy profit for the company.   


Now what do these 3 brands have in common? Well a couple things.

&amp;#x200B;

1) They all make a shit ton of money. 

2) They're all at or near the top of their respective genre.

3) The people who play them don't give a fuck about scandals.   


And that's the bottom line. People don't care about leadership issues at blizzard. And they barely care about unethical work place practices or microtransactions. YouTubers care about those things. Reddit does as well. But the earnings sheet for EA and Activision-Blizzard shows that the PLAYERS don't care.   


The dip is related to optics. Yeah, 2 big releases are pushed back, but people are still going to absolutely play those games once they're released.   


$67.20 a share is a fucking steal. It's going back up to 80-85 at least by the end of the holiday season. And if they out of the headlines, it'll crack 100 by march just like it did last february. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Buy. Gamers are incels who don't care about anything but gaming. Positions -  $70c 5/20/22 x 25. As you can see, I'm already up nearly 2k, which is more than I can say about the lot o' you.

1,"11/04/2021, 23:01:28",Why TSLA is undervalued.,W0lfgangster,"It inevitable that the entire auto industry is taken up by Electric Self-Driving Cars.

What company does the phrase ""Electric Self-Driving Cars"" make you think of?

It's Tesla. Everyone associates Tesla with electric self-driving cars. Not only do they have a majority market share in Electric Autonomous Vehicles, they own the meme of Electric Autonomous Vehicles. That's something you can't buy. It's priceless. EAV's are as much Tesla's brand as roads are government brand. You ever meet someone that just calls all soda ""Coke"" or any game console ""the Nintendo""? That's where Tesla is with EAV's.  

If you don't think EAV's complete takeover of the auto industry is inevitable, you must at least cede that electric takeover is inevitable. For one thing, oil is just going to get harder to get as years pass, at some point the US is gonna run out of shale and the middle east is going to have to start digging into shale and what are gas prices going to look like then? It's more efficient to burn it at an energy plant anyways.  

If you don't think Autonomous vehicles are going to take over, it's hard to see into the future except to say autonomous driving completely changes travel and AI is an emerging technology whose applications we have only scratched the surface. Driving is cheaper than flying and self driving counters the convenience factor of flying. Hell, self-driving could bankrupt most of the airline industry since airlines already run on razor thin margins.  

If your gonna buy TSLA because of this post wait for a dip because I can't in good conscience recommend people buy a stock at ATH. I don't even own TSLA rn I'm just fucking sick of people saying ""worth more than rest of auto industry combined"" yea that projects that they'll one day produce more cars than the rest of the industry. Consider for a minute that their production and revenue graphs both look like exponential growth curves.

They are a land and water resource development company based in CA. They recently acquired a pipeline and have a decent amount they do in the area. 

After steadily increasing for several months, in September the stock price dropped over 50% on literally no negative news, from over $13-$14 to around $6. The company put out a press release after the drop saying nothing has changed and their outlook remains the same to calm investor fears. It has since found support and started trending up from a low in the $5 range, currently at $6.46. 

From what I've read, it seems a hedge fund sold off some shares and that triggered a drop, which triggered stop loss sales, which caused a lot of negative speculation about potential causes and scared people sold. The domino effect was quite large lol. 

At this point there doesn't appear to really be any downside risk. Volume is very low, only 200k-300k avg per day. 3Q earnings results are due any day which will likely cause a spike in volume and the stock price. 

Anyway just figured I'd pass along the info. Prior to this drop the stock was pretty solid in the $10+ range. Getting back to $10 is likely and would be a solid gain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmmg0g/cdzi_cadiz_inc_potentially_big_opportunity_low/

1,"11/04/2021, 22:51:03",ABNB DD/All in,hunter_buyden,"Airbnb earnings is upon us, sharing my DD and my wife's boyfriend's portfolio

Q2 Revenue came in at 1.3B and estimate is 2B, though a beat on revenue is already priced in with the trend seen in consumer spending and BKNG ([bookings.com](https://bookings.com))'s earnings.

All the data points to a roaring quarter for travelling, from airline, hotel and now BKNG's ER. Increase in travel is priced in. However, BKNG revenue came in at 2.16B for Q3 vs 1.14B in Q2, assuming ABNB did not lose market share, there's a lot of upside potential still. Reviewing alexa metrics and google search trends, I'm not seeing signs for a loss of market share, so in the best case scenario, we could see 2.6B for revenue. Given the pricing power companies had in the last quarter and there was no reduction in host fees (ABNB's \~15% cut), I'm expecting a revenue surprise without a miss a profit margins.

This would put ABNB's price/sales numbers in the same ballpark as BKNG, and given the growth trajectory of ABNB, this means tendies for years to come.

Positions:
All my life savings + Vlad's credit card
- 6500 shares in RH (full use of margins)
- 2264 shares in IRA + HSA

Risks:

* Misses profit margins due to refunds
* Loss of market share

If either of the above happens, I'm looking to relocate to a nice tent, most of the good spots are already taken, so if anyone knows a good place near Wendy's HMU

Everytime there's a small spike hedgies manage to smack the price right back down. This is exactly how the short sellers want us to feel so we just give up and paper hand. Well guess what? Not me mother fuckers because I know what I own. RKT is thee most undervalued stock in the current market. There's plenty of solid DD that has been previously posted but I'll point out a few highlights. 

1. Q2 2021: $2.67 in revenue / $920M income. Approx 4B cash on hand 
2. 90% customer retention rate
3. RKT enjoys approx 10% market share of a 3.5T consumer lending market.
4. Recently launched Rocket homes, Rocket Auto which is doing very well. 

Rocket is a Fintech company. The ability of being able to apply for a home loan, car loan, solar loan on your PC or phone is the definition of Fintech. This company is literally printing money while the rest of Reddit is busy pumping and dumping SPAC's and dinosaurs. Don't believe all the FUD about housing crash because it's not happening. The federal government is 30T in debt and cannot afford higher interest rates. They will keep interest rates low even if it means letting inflation and housing prices run hot. The recent slow down in housing numbers is due to lack of supply, not lack of demand. 
It's pretty obvious that some big dog(s) is targeting this stock. My guess is that the big banks are the prime suspects. They have been losing crap loads of revenue to the likes of PayPal, Square etc and cannot afford to lose their mortgage business to another Fintech. Again, I have no proof, this is just a hunch but keep in mind that Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan said he considers fintech's the biggest threat to their business and gives him night sweats so just connect the dots. Banks have unlimited amounts of money, just look at the prices of Gold and Silver prices which are being heavily shorted by the banks and I believe that RKT is a victim of these criminals as well. 

The obvious question is why should I buy RKT right now with all these headwinds? 

For starters, RKT still has a $1B open stock buyback program. According to their latest 10Q filing, they purchased $8M worth of stock last quarter at $16.74. If you haven't realized, shorts are having a very hard time pushing the price lower in the last few weeks while short volume has remained steady. This leads me to believe that the company is actively buying back shares at these prices. 
I've read all the bear thesis on RKT and it's all hogwash. Oh, Dan Gilbert owns 93% of the company, this company shouldn't have gone public yada yada yada.... 
Would you rather own a small piece of a good thing or nothing at all? So that's a good reason to short this company to oblivion? What's the problem, you won't be able to buy a large stake and control a company that has been in business for over 35+ years? 
Oh yea I forgot, THERE'S A HOUSING CRASH COMING..... 
I wish people would stop referencing Evergrande and comparing the US housing market to the Chinese fiasco. We don't have ghost cities around here and we're actually short seven million homes. 
Yes, homes are expensive but there's still solid demand that will keep prices stable. 
Following up on the fed meeting yesterday, Jpow is in no rush to raise interest rates which is a great tailwind for the industry. 
There aren't a lot of bargains left in the stock market and RKT is definitely the best bang for the buck. Earnings are coming up after the bell and I'm expecting beats all around and that elusive divvy  

I'm high as fuck writing this so please don't take this as financial advice.

All toy companies have been posting strong earnings with minimal supply chain issues.

I believe Funko should follow this pattern with strong Funko Pop sales along with strong sales from Loungefly and their new NFTs.

**Funko Pop**

Strong pre-orders from Squid Game pops and Disney 50th anniversary pops

**Loungefly**

Trends look very strong for Loungefly, should have strong back to school earnings.

**NFTs**

This will be the first report where NFT revenue is included. All NFT drops have sold out in 15-30 minutes with strong aftermarket sales (they earn a few percent on all aftermarket sales)

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/review-journal-neuroscience-shows-no-133000007.html

AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cassava Sciences, Inc. has been informed by the Journal of Neuroscience that there is no evidence of data manipulation in an article it published in July 2012 describing a new approach to treating Alzheimer's disease1. The peer-reviewed article was co-authored by scientists and academic collaborators for Cassava Sciences and is foundational to simufilam, the Companys lead drug candidate for the proposed treatment of Alzheimers disease.

Ive never doubted the integrity of our people or science, said Remi Barbier, President &amp; CEO. We remain focused on conducting a Phase 3 clinical program of simufilam in people with Alzheimers disease. Its an important endeavor, notwithstanding pundits who may be louder than they are learned. Well stay the course until our job is done.

So a bunch of lawyers filed lawsuits saying Cassava was manipulating the data which caused the stock to crash and cost a bunch of retail tens of thousands of dollars.  The lawyers are representing a bunch of investors that were shorting the stock.  A real peer journal review has now said that there is no evidence of that.  How is this legal?  This shitheads get on TV everyday and say how bad us retail traders are and we manipulate the market when they are clearly the ones doing the manipulation.  Will these short sellers be called before congress for their lies?  Of course not.they have money and power and no one cares what they do.

AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cassava Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: SAVA) has been informed by the Journal of Neuroscience that there is no evidence of data manipulation in an article it published in July 2012 describing a new approach to treating Alzheimer's disease1. The peer-reviewed article was co-authored by scientists and academic collaborators for Cassava Sciences and is foundational to simufilam, the Companys lead drug candidate for the proposed treatment of Alzheimers disease.

Ive never doubted the integrity of our people or science, said Remi Barbier, President &amp; CEO. We remain focused on conducting a Phase 3 clinical program of simufilam in people with Alzheimers disease. Its an important endeavor, notwithstanding pundits who may be louder than they are learned. Well stay the course until our job is done.

So a bunch of lawyers filed lawsuits saying SAVA was manipulating the data which caused the stock to crash and cost a bunch of retail traders tens of thousands of dollars.  The lawyers are representing a bunch of investors that were shorting the stock.  A real peer journal review has now said that there is no evidence of that.  How is this legal?  These shitheads get on TV everyday and say how bad us retail traders are and we manipulate the market when they are clearly the ones doing the manipulation.  Will these short sellers be called before congress for their lies?  Of course not.they have money and power and no one cares what they do.

We got the jump up to 464 that I was looking for, we over shot a bit which is to be expected. We still have the volume divergences and indicator bearish divergences on lower time frames however we still have not cycled on the weekly time frame. So, where does that leave us: we see a mix of sideway chop with these downward spasms mixed in. 

Something to be aware of: there are 7 trend metrics on 6 different time frames that i track and have tracked for the last 10years. Whenever a time frame reaches 7out of 7 bullish or bearish metrics we usually get a reaction to the opposite bias. For example, if all 7 metrics showing bearish then you look for bullish move, on lower time frames you look for that move to happen that day but on 4 hour and above there is a timing lag. the larger the time frame the larger the time lag. i say all of this to warn that a down day is near because my daily trend metrics are all bullish this morning which means that between now and the next 5 days, we will have a down trend day that could possibly take us back down toward 460 area. So right now, I don't see holding long bullish positions overnight. So, I may possibly take intraday long position and it would be very small position but for the most part I am waiting on signals to line up to get short which should happen today or tomorrow. Todays levels of importance are 465.59 and 466.35. we break 465.59 we go to 466 area. If we hit the 466 area expect it to act like a magnet and will take a big volume push to get us off that level one way or another. 1) We hold above support area of 464 we start a range day consolidation going back and forth between 464 and 466 area. 2) we break support at 464 which opens a door down to 461 area. 3) we get another wild trend up day consolidating around 466 area before taking off toward 468 area. 

1) we hold above support area of 464 we start a range day consolidation going back and forth between 464 and 466 area. **45% probability** 

2) we get another wild trend up day hanging around 466 area before blasting off toward 468 area. **35% probability**

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. Management

As part of Paysafes preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, theyve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. Theyve hired PayPals Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebooks Head of Payments and Amazon Intls Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.

Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafes value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term traders hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.

Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of [Visa](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/skrill-usa-launches-skrill-virtual-visar-prepaid-card-in-us/), [Coinbase](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-issues-coinbase-s-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/), [Fubo Gaming](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-streamlines-payments-for-interactive-wagering-with-fubo-gaming-in-us/), [FOXbet](https://www.njgamblingfun.com/nj/sports-news/paysafe-continues-its-push-into-online-gaming), [Golden Nugget](http://www.greensheet.com/newswire.php?newswire_id=53685), [Bankable](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-partners-with-bankable-to-provide-omnichannel-banking-services/), [Wix](https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2021/smbs-can-accept-payments-with-paysafe-skrill-on-wix/), [Repay](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), [WynnBet](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/wynnbet-taps-paysafe-for-payments-and-marketing-solutions/), [Betfred USA](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-expands-betfred-usa-sports-partnership-through-income-access-deal/), [OwnersBox](https://incomeaccess.com/contenthub/ownersbox-launches-affiliate-program/), [Dutch neobank bunq](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/bunq-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-cash-deposits-for-digital-banking/), [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/), Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, [Smart Property Systems](https://globalfintechseries.com/banking/digital-payments/paysafe-partners-with-smart-property-systems-in-north-america/), Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, [Montana Lottery](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-powers-online-payments-for-montana-lotterys-sportsbook/), PlayUP, [SuperBook Sports](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-platform-launches-with-superbook-sports-in-colorado-and-new-jersey/) and [Bitrise](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-accelerates-innovation-with-bitrise-for-faster-digital-wallets-payments/).

In that same period, theyve also:

* expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to [48 states](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-skrill-expands-its-crypto-service/),
* expanded their digital wallets to [trade](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-neteller-launches-fiat-to-crypto-withdrawal-service/) 38 \[digital\]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies
* launched online cash payments on Microsofts [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) in 22 countries
* struck deals with [Snowflake](https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/paysafe-integrates-snowflake-to-power-cloud-based-approach-for-enhanced-customer-experiences/) and Amazons [AWS](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/paysafe-partners-aws-to-become-cloud-based-payments-provider/) to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition,
* [launched](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) a new global travel safeguarding model,
* a unique innovation that quickly led to a new [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally.

Also during this time, they announced the appointments of:

* Digital wallet division CEO, [Chirag Patel](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-chirag-patel-to-lead-its-digital-wallets-division/) (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander)
* North American iGaming CEO, [Zak Cutler](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-zak-cutler-to-lead-its-north-america-igaming-business/) (fmr DraftKings exec),
* Boardmember [Mark Brooker](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/paysafe-appoints-mark-brooker-as-non-exec-director/) (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill)

All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canadas [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, were seeding the future growth right now The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspectiveIts our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.

Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.

The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafes value creation playbook which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe  an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.

In this context, its worth underscoring Foleys undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. Hes also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.  Though hes not Paysafes front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that   Bill is highly engaged with the company. Personally, I dont doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

# 9. Lockup Expiration

Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafes value creation playbook. Between Foleys consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstones stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.

Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified base returns for a four year hold period of 2.9x to 3.8x from $10.  

From their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.

&amp;#x200B;

# 10. Valuation

Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.

Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owners cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.

Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of $3.7 billion, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.

Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFEs financial data, like YFs overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  Its not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.

Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesnt matter in the long run.

True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.

&amp;#x200B;

Until then, here are a few reference points:

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at Paysafes eCash segment as a separate company:

The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.

Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyens 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafes eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. Thats close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.

Using Adyens EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafes eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the companys entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.

Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafes total business.

&amp;#x200B;

Brick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing

Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.

For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. 

In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.

&amp;#x200B;

Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet

Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, heres a deeper look into that comparison:

As noted earlier, Paysafes stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.

By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPals troubles as a buying opportunity.

Some will reasonably say thats because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPals numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).

Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafes 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPals recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.

Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a free cash flow machine, Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).

Theres obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPLs multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFEs potential acquisition debt and dilution:

* PayPals EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10
* PayPals EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90
* PayPals Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.
* PayPals EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75
* PayPals free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41

Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31

When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.

Sector multiples:

Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.

After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, heres Paysafes share price with the averaged peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67
* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17
* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72

Average : $41.84

It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FISs tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFEs recent price action, but certainly not all.

Sure, its easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, the market doesnt care, but Im confident thatll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ERs gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of look at the chart and price is truth.  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.

No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.

The AMC price broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern yesterday.  
To verify this triangle we are looking for Lower Highs and Higher Lows within the pattern.  
We are also looking for declining volume within the triangle.

The breakout happened after touching the support the third time. This led to a breakout of the triangle and to a change of structure. What we are now seeing is a trend-continuation (within the primary upwards trend since january). 

As we saw in yesterdays session, the price tends to move towards Previous Highs, where we see selling pressure ($44 to $39 in 6 hours). In the upwards structure, we are looking for a higher lows, followed by a higher high, which would bring us to the $52 level in the upcoming days.

From a [technical point of view](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart_analysis:chart_patterns:symmetrical_triangle_continuation) we can see a price increase of up to 120% during the breakout. The target is measured from the all-time high at $72 to the next low at $29.

Now Ill go ahead and start this off by saying this stock is not an incredibly shorted stock! No, shorts have been slowly exiting their positions as they know theyve been made. 

Okay so, GERN (Geron) founded by John Scarlett (if you dont know him check out his track record). Theyve been focusing on creating their Imetelstat which creates blood transfusion independence (T.I.) in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).

Imetelstat also extends the lives of those patients by &gt; 30mths as compared to best available treatment (BAT), which is Jakafi, at a terrible 12mths.

Do the math. 

Which drug works best for those patients?

The safety profile is terrific. All negative side effects are reversable.

In some patients, it has REVERSED the fibrosis and they go on living longer due to imetelstat.

We don't know how long they've lived yet, but I suspect we'll find out soon enough. 

Now heres some absolutely tasty information, and please fact check me! The ex-head of the FDA Scott Gottlieb, he's a partner with NEA Ventures, and owns about 18 million shares in Geron. Now if youre asking me I dont know how much more bullish it can get. GERN stock currently trading at $1.60, and for the past three months has had a .40 increase. Although all time highs in the $6 range when J&amp;J was discussing buying Geron until they backed out of the deal, this was in 2018 and the share price plummeted. 

Currently has enrollment in phase 3 studies, and the next step you guessed it FDA approval. So in my humblest opinion Geron is a sleeping giant currently undervalued extremely.

1,"11/04/2021, 20:26:15",How much does Tesla need to earn in order to justify its current valuation?,EpisodicThoughts,"https://imgur.com/gallery/keCnGJU

TL;DR: Tesla should probably be earning about 33x-100x as much as their most recent year-to-date earnings in order to justify the current valuation.


I've been hearing about how overvalued Tesla is for over a year now, and I'm getting tired of it. So I decided to look into the financial data myself, and determine just how reasonable or ridiculous Tesla's current valuation is. 

To get a baseline for what an auto manufacturer's legitmate value should be, I decided to look at historical data for the 5 largest automotive companies today. I chose to examine data from 2010-2015, as that is the most recent time period in which the overall market was within one standard deviation above or below ""fair value"" on the Buffett Indicator. I then recorded each company's Market Capitalization and Earnings at the end of each year. 

I'm an idiot, so I decided I'd divide Earnings by Market Cap to find a ratio to determine what Tesla's earnings *should* be given their current valuation. I came to realize later that this is essentially the P/E ratio, but inversed. If any fellow smoothies didn't know (like me), P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current share price of a stock by its EPS (earnings per share), however you can also calculate it by dividing the company's total Market cap by their total earnings, which I did the inverse of. Anyways, the math still functions the same for my intended purpose. 

I calculated that the largest auto manufacturers earned an average of 8%-28% of their valuations back when the market was most fairly valued, according to the Buffett Indicator. So, in order for Tesla to be fairly valued at $1.2 Trillion, they should be earning about $107 Billion to $343 Billion each year. In the past 5 years, Tesla earned an average of -0.83% of their market cap with their most recent earnings around $3 Billion.

For reference, the highest recorded earnings of any company in history was $114 Billion by the oil company Saudi Aramco in 2018. As another reference, Apple's highest ever yearly earnings was $61 Billion, also in 2018.  

If Tesla was a literal money printer that costs $1,200 and prints $3/year, it'd take 400 years to be profitable. Even if it ramps up the printing, it would still take ages. But hey, putting a car in space was kinda cool.

# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.
*****
&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.
*****
&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.
*****
&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%
*****
&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.
*****
&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The Feds tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth, said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.
*****
&gt; The Feds tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets, he added.
*****
&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program later this month. This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus its provided since the pandemic took hold.
*****
&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.
*****
&gt; The Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of todays meeting, which is why we arent seeing a taper-tantrum 2.0, said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.
*****
&gt; [W]ere coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season, said Oandas Craig Erlam. The economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels, he added.
*****
&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last weeks number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.
*****
&gt; Octobers hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.

Thats what now the 4th or 5th Er in a row with qoq over 15 % growth. And somehow this trades a a p/e of 8.4 with a forward p/e of 4.5. Yet crazy enough the short % has grown significantly (leading to a 35% drop since last quarters awesome Er) which blows my mind for a company this successful. Many of the shorts expected significant revenue contraction and instead himx continues to blow the doors out. This is probably your last chance to get in at a great entry.

What qualifications do I have? Absolutely fucking none. I worked in energy trading for a bit and saw the way the big boys blow their money so that you have an absolute guide and quick easy access to the most retarded shit you can do once you graduate college and start making big boy money.

Start with the following:

 Forget everything you ever learned about smart investing. Delete the following terms from your fucking memory: T bills, savings accounts, CDs, mutual funds, 401ks, investing for the future, dividends .

2,"11/04/2021, 17:40:02",TLRY: Reaching for global leadership,UMNMURTY,"Third-party data suggests that the legal cannabis market will reach a whopping $91 billion by 2028, implying an impressive CAGR of 26%. As medical cannabis has recently become legal in many parts of the world, further legalization can be the key catalyst boosting product demand. The expected growth in the sector is also attributed to awareness about the health benefits of cannabis.
Additional data suggests that the global cannabis pharmaceutical market was set to grow from $67 million in 2019 by a CAGR of 76% through 2027. Should Tilray position itself as a key player in this rapidly growing industry, investors stand to reap the benefits over the next several years.

Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett is much more optimistic, and sees gain potential of 90% at his price target of $22. He expects Tilray to strike sizable deals in the US sometime soon. The analyst also thinks that Tilray should buy cannabis assets to achieve the companys ambitious sales target. However, TLRY can skyrocket to 142 at some point because of high short interest and volume.

II (Northern Star) (NYSE: NSTB), today released its Q3 2021 Apex Next Investor Outlook. The report highlights the top stocks and noteworthy holdings of the rising class of Gen Z investors. Amid a quarter characterized by inflation concerns and a fits-and-starts reopening associated with the global pandemic, Apexs data reveals younger investors maintained a bullish stance on AMC and GameStoptwo of the earliest meme stocks to gain widespread popularity earlier this year. Other names within the Gen Z top 10 also held steady, including Tesla, Apple, and Amazon, hinting at the younger generations proclivity to provide stable support for its highest-conviction holdings. Shorter-term sentiment was evident elsewhere in the rankings, as vaccine makers Moderna and Pfizer enjoyed a nice bump upwards on the back of booster-shot momentum. Giant retailers Costco and Home Depot also climbed the rankings as Gen Z bet their healthy budgets and supply chain expertise would spell success this holiday season.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gen Z investors are changing the investment world in meaningful ways  and we could be in the early innings of this transformation, said **Bill Capuzzi, Chief Executive Officer of Apex**. In Q3, heavyweight meme stocks AMC and GameStop exhibited impressive staying power in Gen Z portfolios, standing right alongside more traditional mega-cap holdings, such as Apple and Amazon. As this key demographic continues to develop and express unique investment views, our team at Apex looks forward to providing ongoing data and information around these significant developments.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Apex Next Investor Outlook includes data of the top 100 stocks owned by millions of investors on the Apex platform. The Q3 2021 report is based on more than 1 million Gen Z accounts, in addition to more than 5 million accounts held by Millennials, Gen X and Baby Boomers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Themes in the Q3 Apex Next Investor Outlook include:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Vaccine stocks catch another wave ** As shares of vaccine makers climbed in Q3 amid growing momentum for booster shots and vaccine mandates, Gen Z investors rekindled their interest in frontrunners Moderna and Pfizer. Moderna vaulted 27 spots to #19 while Pfizer climbed 20 spots to #45. Gen Z also took notice of Novavax (up 7 spots to #87). The company has been focused on making regulatory headway in lower-income countries after falling behind in the race for authorization in the US and Europe. Johnson &amp; Johnson retreated 1 notch to #39. Vaccine demandor lack thereofis expected to have minimal effect on the companys overall financial performance, given its choice to deploy a not-for-profit pricing model for the vaccine.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Smooth sailing for meme stocks ** Gen Z support for flagship meme stocks stayed strong in Q3. AMC kept its crown as the #1 holding and GameStop also showed staying power this quarter, holding steady at #6. Outside of consistent heavy-hitters, other meme stocks continued to make appearances within the Gen Z rankings. Camber Energy joined the list in Q3 at #10, propelled by a massive September runup in its share price. Vinco Ventures, a digital media company that recently became involved in the red-hot non-fungible token (NFT) arena, debuted at #55.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Charting a new course for retailers ** Ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season, Gen Z investors backed big-name retailers. Q3 saw notable moves in giants like Costco (up 20 spots to #31), Walmart (up 8 spots to #52), Target (up 3 spots to #53) and Home Depot (up spots 22 to #76). In the face of extraordinary shipping disruptions and logistics challenges, large retailers with sophisticated supply chains and deep pockets appeared to shine.

 ElectraMeccanica ([SOLO](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=solo)) is a designer and manufacturer of three-wheeled electric vehicles based in Vancouver, Canada.  ElectraMeccanica is the brainchild of Jerry Kroll and COO Henry Reisner, the latter of whom used the knowledge he acquired at his brother Franks sports car company, Intermeccanica, to design and produce the companys flagship vehicle: a single-seat three wheeled electric vehicle called the Solo.

**What is their production capacity**

Solo commercial production began on Aug. 26 in Chongqing, China in partnership with the Chinese motorcycle manufacturer Zongshen Industrial Group, which already makes about 3 million motorcycles annually. ElectraMeccanica has the capacity to produce 20,000 vehicles annually and Zongshen has agreed to produce a total of 75,000 Solos over a three-year period once ElectraMeccanica has begun full-scale production. 

**Pricing/Growth potential**

 The car is priced at $18,500 and is sold through shopping mall kiosks (similar to Tesla selling its vehicles through retail stores rather than dealerships). After launching in Los Angeles and Portland earlier this year, ElectraMeccanica plans to expand sales to Arizona and the San Francisco Bay area.7 CEO Paul Rivera told *The New York Times* that ElectraMeccanica plans to expand to the rest of the country over the next 18-24 months before going global. 

*IN A NUTSHELL*

SOLO makes three wheeled vehicles that are yes, VERY reasonably priced relative to the current EV market for simple commuter traffic and, yes, fleet programs.

**But what are the potential catalysts you might ask**

Well, SOLO is very invested in the idea of selling these vehicles in *fleet packages*. Even if you go to their website, it is literally on the front page. They know that the average consumer will probably not be interested in spending $18,500 MSRP on a single occupancy vehicle. We have seen how smart cars just.. came and went. But follow the CEO at any trade show or media outlet and he will talk time and time again about *fleets*. And more importantly, *having the cubic volume necessary to transport food*.

These guys know they cannot compete with NIO, they cannot compete with Tesla. But what they can do, is leverage their product for a very niche customer in a very lucrative industry: Food delivery.

Everyone from Pizza Hut to Papa Johns, to UBER and Doordash, and even corporate commuters amongst the tech 100 would be interested in using these.

**But why would corporate fleets matter.**

Two reasons why: (well actually three) 

1) A Biden presidency dead set on climate change and EV growth.

A 1.4 trillion dollar infrastructure bill with a *very* substantial portion being devoted towards EV tax rebates. As yes, it is hard at this moment to say how much of that SOLO can qualify for since their tricycle car is technically a ""motorcycle"", but we this could change as wording in the bill becomes adjusted with time and/or we see SOLO be granted a change in legal definition to a car rather than a ""motorcycle"".

2) A growing demand for food delivery.

UBER eats, door dash, grub hub, and post mates. We have seen everything from prime time ad spots during march madness to super bowl adverts. All four of the major delivery companies are fighting tooth and nail for market share. What's more, their major road block to market share is attracting delivery drivers to their key markets. 

**Well what would be a major way to attract drivers**

You give incentive to your top drivers, after x amount of months or x amount of deliveries, they are given access to a SOLO fleet vehicle. Park your vehicle at a fleet site (or a reimbursable UBER lift round trip to a site) and you get to work without fear of wages biting into your gas/car value. And, UBER wins because they get to claim depreciation of a very cheap vehicle and they will just write it off as a capital investment. Seriously. If they could spend $2million to boost their driver retention by 30-40% you don't think they would? These companies are in it for the long haul.

3) SOLO is currently stationed along the most liberal left leaning states

SOLO has retail outlets all throughout the west coast, from Arizona to Washington state to Colorado. These state municipalities would not be ones to fight cheap, effective vehicles for transporting state employees around their city to do their day-to-day shit and also feel good for helping to curb the climate crisis (while also probably being rewarded generously in funding for doing so by the federal government).

**SO LET US TALK ABOUT STUPID INSANE VALUATION**

Let us consider how our most favorite tech stock/EV stocks are trading at revenue:market cap in the last five years and where SOLO can stand to *fucking explode*.

As I mentioned above, SOLO has a market cap of \~450Million, with production capacity coming next year (probably Q1-Q2 2022) of around 55,000 vehicles (20,000 from Arizona and about 31,000 from China). At $18,500 MSRP, that brings us damn near to $1Billion in revenues.

Now, as it stands, SOLO has very little revenues shown. However, we know how good it looks to have explosive quarterly revenue growth. SOLO reported quarterly revenues of 183k in Mar 2021, a 111% Y/Y growth. June 2021, 283k in revenue. 2800% YoY growth. Their *total revenue for 2020*? 200k.

So, we can easily expect the next earnings on 11/8 to be **amazing** because [they have been delivering on preorders as of October 6](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/06/2309566/0/en/ElectraMeccanica-Begins-First-Customer-Deliveries-of-Flagship-SOLO-EV.html)

Now. What  does this mean to value investors?

Well, if we start seeing full scale production come online in the [brand new factory they broke ground on in May](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/jobs/2021/05/11/electrameccanica-breaks-ground-arizona-factory-solos-mesa/5040895001/) then their chinese partner Zongshen Industrial Group will start immediate production of their 31,000 units/year. [Oh. The same partners that just exercised $6,000,000 in warrants last week.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electrameccanica-strategic-partner-zongshen-industrial-123100772.html)

**The top EV companies are trading nearly ten times their annual revenues**

If SOLO confirms a blowout year of 1 billion in revenue their first year of full scale production, this stock will easily deliver on at least a 4billion market cap. That's $40/share at least.

*Well shit this stock went to $13 just last november.*

**Lets draw stupid lines and look at stupid graphs**

https://preview.redd.it/6j6znynnhjx71.png?width=3281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ccf8a05c173ace507521b1c745c485c7137e773

So, SOLO had a *beautiful* squeeze that ran from May of '20 to Nov '20 that netted over a 1300% return from bottom to top. SOLO had no news. It had no deliverable product forecast, and even at $1/share, it was still seen as pits because the company had done absolutely nothing to prop it up. But that's **a really good thing**, because unlike other bullshit pump/dump schemes like NKLA or GNUS, SOLO refuses to drop any news unless it is concrete and tangible. They are about numbers, numbers, numbers.

I want you to pay attention to two things before the November squeeze from 2.5/share to 13/share. Volume, and short interest.

In Oct'20, shorts thought they had SOLO pegged and short interest climbed from 0.5% of shares **to 20%** in just two months. And you can see why: Shorts are fucking dumb, and they think a company that jumps from $1 to $6 a share is still over valued after it falls 50%, right? Wrong. Red volume is still volume, and SOLO went from trading 2-3 million in shares per month to now 20-50 million. People were paying attention. Except, shorts were stubborn, and we saw short interest rise and shorts more than 4x their positions from $17,000,000 to $58,000,000.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/28dbfz9whjx71.png?width=3242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0745acd103a8df3914fe248f1bdff38dcd819f8a

&amp;#x200B;

So what happened? Well we all know. Shorts got fucked. Volume would climb to over 150,000,000 shares in one day, and SOLO would squeeze to $13/share. And yes, it fell of course and failed to maintain a support from $6-8 a share, but guess what? It has found support at $3 and refuses to go any lower, with this past month seeing a healthy rise of 30% with minimal pressure to the downside. We also broke past a three months resistance point and are breaking out of the downward channel established from seven months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7unx2w8hjjx71.png?width=2734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39b577ebe24cec375eda16336983c85405c8582a

**What are some potential catalysts going into next month/year**

Well, several. And I don't think they have even come close to impacting the stocks value because no one fucking knows about SOLO. Yes, it popped off in november, and yes, it was talked about. But for the most part it has faded from the collective meme stock short term memory of robinhoodlums and most degenerates, but it will return. And you will want to be there when it happens.

But to condense catalysts: EV bill signing, blow out earnings, pictures/videos of first SOLOs rolling out of a brand new assembly line, fleet deals with major food companies/delivery apps, and god knows what else. God forbid Elon posts a meme?

At the same time it's a company that has been as high as 17$ per share that is down to 10$ a share. 

From my understanding, the value has been pushed down due to a massive 20 million short attack.

# RlOT $600MM Offering is likely already completed - Tendie Time

&amp;#x200B;

ALRIGHT - just went down a wormhole, I think the $600MM offering is likely completed and that we will find this out on the quarterly financials when earnings are reported next week. RlOT will moon from it's current price of $32 to $50+ no doubt (well on our way to our previous ATH of $79.5)

Looking back to RlOT's last offering - [12/4/2020 Offering for $200MM](https://www.riotblockchain.com/investors/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001079973-20-001054/riot_s3.htm) \- was completed in about a month by January 2021 per [RlOT's next quarterly financial statements](https://www.riotblockchain.com/investors/sec-filings/quarterly-reports/content/0001079973-21-000383/0001079973-21-000383.pdf):

&gt;At-the-Market Equity Offering: During January 2021, in connection with the Second Amendment to the At-the-Market Sales Agreement between the Company and its sales agent, H.C. Wainwright, the Company received gross proceeds of approximately $84.8 million ($82.7 million net of $2.1 million in expenses) from the sale of4,433,468 shares of common stock, with an average fair value of $19.13 per share, in the December 2020 ATM Offering. **With the sale and issuance of these shares, all $200 million in shares of the Companys common stock registered under the December 2020 Registration Statement had been issued and the Company completed the December 2020 ATM Offering**. Under the terms of the December 2020 ATM Offering, the Company only issued shares of its common stock.

Looking at RlOT's most recent offering - [8/31/2021 Offering for $600MM](https://www.riotblockchain.com/investors/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001079973-21-000875/riot_s3asr.htm) \- the buyers are the following:

&gt;Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., **B. Riley** **FBR, Inc**., BTIG, LLC, Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC and Roth Capital Partners, LLC

On 9/15/21, two weeks after the offering was announced.. Guess which analyst increased their RlOT price target from $51 to $82?

**B. RILEY** \- [Link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RIOT/price-target/)

You can bet your ass that B. fucking Riley has already acquired their shares from the offering and is pumpingg the stock

*(why would they publicly upgrade a stock if they weren't done purchasing their shares from the offering yet?)*

HYPOTHESIS - the offering is closed, it's been closed, with earnings next week the notes to the quarterly financial statements will reveal that the dilution is over/it has been over since September.

Wheels up baby, lets get this bread.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Other note of interest: BTIG, LLC, and Compass Point also initated coverage/have a ""BUY"" rating on RlOT. Hopefully we see them raise their price targets in the next week as well for additional confirmation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmf64l/2x_tendies_incoming/

TLDR: $COIN is criminally undervalued and will print at earnings next Tuesday (Nov 9th).

From Coinbase's Q2 10Q filing ([0001679788-21-000026 (q4cdn.com)](https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/dcec079b-3237-4ae0-a54d-479ded972ab8.pdf) , p. 5), we can see that their revenues and profits skyrocketed in 2021:

&amp;#x200B;

$COIN is currently at a market cap of $90B, so if that $1.6B profit holds steady for the rest of 2021, that would put their P/E ratio at 14 (90/(1.6\*4)). That is insanely low for the premier crypt-o trading platform in the US.

And you know what? I think $COIN is actually going to **beat** their previous revenue numbers in Q3. Looking in their Q2 letter to shareholders ( [Coinbase-Q221-Shareholder-Letter.pdf (q4cdn.com)](https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Coinbase-Q221-Shareholder-Letter.pdf), p. 11), we can see that the vast majority of their revenues come from transactions (fees, etc.):

[Revenue Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/1ghla29ecix71.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d974927ebbf2f51eb346cee011b6410a1bb5b8bd)

And you know what happened since then? First, we had doggie-coin mania (see Coinbase's blog about adding the most recent one to go parabolic:  [Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now available on Coinbase | by Coinbase | Sep, 2021 | The Coinbase Blog](https://blog.coinbase.com/shiba-inu-shib-is-now-available-on-coinbase-e7fdd13856be) ). This suggests to me that overall interest in crypt-o was high during Q3. And guess what else? Coinbase just recently jumped to the top of the app download charts on iOS (#1) and Android (#2):  [Coinbase Is The Most Downloaded iOS App In The US, Second On Play Store - Converted Organics (COIN) | Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/10/23710233/coinbase-is-the-most-downloaded-ios-app-in-the-us-second-on-play-store).

Based on this, I'm betting that transaction volume was **even higher in Q3 than Q2**. If I'm right, $COIN could print at the upcoming earnings announcement. And even if it doesn't print, I'd be pretty happy to hold this bag for the long term.

If you can afford them, probably to be most safe from Theta decay, late December puts will be best.

1,"11/04/2021, 12:10:39",Pretty bullish TA on the weekly chart for $GME,MajorKeyBro,"A lot of TA on the daily chart but I want to zoom out a bit to the weekly. A weekly chart uses each candle to represent an entire week.

&amp;#x200B;

[FLAG MACD TTM RSI](https://preview.redd.it/zko9lu2b7ix71.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae6b06a7870ba5df6bd4cdf524a10cb96d38a53b)

Basic TA but a few indicators to look at here.

1. First thing is the MACD, this indicator is based on moving averages and the tendency of averages to cross over, showing momentum in either one direction or the other. It has actually been bearish since June. Which is true because since the peak, we have only been going down. The good news is this is showing a strong momentum upwards again as the shorter term average is getting ready to cross over the longer term average. The August run shows some upwards momentum but never showed a crossover. A real crossover can be the start of another big run. At this scale a miniature golden cross is what it is.  

2. Next is the TTM indicator, which is a consolidation and volatility indicator. When consolidation happens it generally leads to some sort of break out, either up or down, especially with a highly volatile stock. The crazy thing is that even with the run up this week, TTM is showing a strong upwards movement, but far from what the indicator would consider baseline. The big run GME is on appears to simply be an upwards correction and If we do cross into green we can expect to carry it well.

3. Then we got the RSI, this is a measure of how over-sold or over-bought a stock may be. Rather than momentum, this is based on price and volume. The lower this dips the more likely it will rebound, and vise versa. The price and RSI move relative but not equal. MACD and TTM can usually only be real strong when the RSI still looks reasonable, momentum can quickly end when the stock becomes over-bought and over-valued. Well RSI is still within reason. It is still below where it was during the last few runs ups, showing that there is still room to run, if we run to the RSI levels we were at it gives us room to reach $250-$300 or more, and once that happens no telling where this can go. 

4. The giant bull flag in the room. This thing has shown us pennant after pennant. With lower and lower volume each time. With the lowest days and weeks happening just recently. Total textbook bullish TA. It is only still worth talking about because it has proven itself again and again. We may finally see a new bull flag break out but at a much larger scale.

My opinion? We see another big run in the next days/weeks. We could be approaching buy button lock down levels again. Get in while you can..

But honestly im kinda retarded and this is like kindergarten TA so yeah thx bye not financial advise.

1,"11/04/2021, 11:59:04",My thoughts on OCUGN,OriginalSuspect5812,"Some things to remember going into tomorrow. 

1- Unlike current approved Covid-19 vaccines which use newer messenger RNA technologies or stem cell
technologies, Covaxin is a whole-
virion inactivated COVID-19 vaccine
based on a traditional approach. As
such, LeBoyer ,a Notable analyst,
thinks this should ""address concerns
that have led to avoidance of the
current vaccines. Meaning imagine this getting higher demand than current mRNA vaccines. We are talking about
Moderna like that is worth 100s of
dollars, but dont take my advice.

2- WHO approval hasn't hit the
mainstream media. Tons of people
are extremely cautious of mRNA
vaccines. IMO, once people find out there's an option for children, other then Pfizer, that will make a difference.
COVAXIN - Age 2 + yrs Inactivated vaccine
Pfizer -Age 5+ yrs
mRNA technology.

3- Market makers and clearing houses
can't find shares. The volume over the past 3 days (491,999,135) is basically 2.5 x the float of the company (Float = 198 million shares). Since the start of the month there has been +1.3
Billion shares traded. Trade volume can be found here. Market makers have what's called T+2 or T+3 settlement which means they have 2-3 days to
settle a trade. So if you buy in at $15 and they push the stock down and you cut loses at $11 then they never had to settle your trade and pocketed that difference.

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-do-t1-t2-and-t3-mean/

4- India is one of the worlds biggest vaccine makers and this is its first vaccine. Even Modi is personally pushing. Forget the hedges the Indian government is backing this.

Maybe my next move will bring me enough wealth, in particular I'm greedy.  
I recently found an interesting coin called **""KEEP""**, never heard about it before till I saw a random youtube-video of a indian hobby-analyst who tried to make some sense out of the numbers but as I took a deeper look at it, it made sense that the market-potential has still huge place to grow, taking a look at the total supply and more interesting, the circulating supply, **it could take some percentages of growth, way above the 100 percent as an addition to its current state**.    


# LETS FUCKING PUMP IT UP  YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

*In my eyes, the closest thing to the latest underrated mega hyped coins. Lets make it a huge thing to become rich.*

**Current supply (total):  598,014,620** 

**Type: Deflationary**

***My part: 30.000 (25% of life savings)***

***Your part: open end.***

Go for it, go for the moon and the boner, I mean go for the stoners, I meant you should buy it right now, or you come too late, and it will already be saturated in the closer future.

How am I certain they will get FDA approval is that they delayed it 3 months from August to November so that they could submit all the information necessary to the FDA, this is exactly what happened with CCXI which I had posted about a month ago. They are getting FDA approval for Topiramate Oral Solution which would have a huge market cap of 800 million and it will be the first liquid solution.

Now keep that in the back of your mind and remember that one of the 10 wonders of the world is compound interest. Lets put those concepts together.

Step 1
Lets say all you own is one left shoe and a bottle cap. Sell those two items for $0.25 and invest 75% of the funds in the Vanguard index fund. The other 25% invest in rolling 2 year rolling LEAPs of the same index fund. Now here is the key next step

Step 2
Per special relativity, as you approach the speed of sound or as you are near a large mass such as a near a black hole, your normal time relative to time on earth will be significantly slower. Given this - you will now need to sneak into the next RocketLab or SpaceX launch to orbit around the earth - now you will need to engage an orbital speed 1,000x times the typical 20x the speed of sound. Upon arrival back to earth, after a couple years - you will be 2 years older in age but earth - and your investments - will be much older. You will want to sit down when you check your account because it will be $1B.

Both of these companies report on Thursday at 4pm. I am balancing my bullish bet on Live Nation with a bearish bet on AirBNB. LYV is the more interesting play.

As you see these are not small positions. Short dated calls because I believe in my thesis, but don't do as I do or say; I may be a mad Orca.

**Bearish on AirBNB:**

Almost all of ABNB traffic comes from USA. Guess what? USA was dealing with C-19 in Q3. ABNB was cool in the beginning of C-19 because people were looking for an alternative to hotels but then they realized the experience and value sucks.

Most ABNB posts on their reddit is from Q2. Seems that things have slowed down significantly in Q3.

This is while we are expecting revenue growth. Most people book their ABNB in advance so I expect a lot of the revenue from Q3 was already booked in Q2. I think ABNB is just a meme stock for institutions. As a match making site for dirty, overpriced, over hyped, amateur hotel site I don't see a 108B market cap as reasonable. It feels overstretched going into earnings at $176.

**Bullish on Live Nation**

LYV operates our beloved Ticketmaster. Just like ABNB, LYV is a matching service. Matching people seeking entertainment to events. Concert goers don't care about C-19. Most concerts get booked early because people don't want to wait for tickets to sell out. This means that LYV is booking their revenue before the concerts happen. Also NFL season start will boosted their bottom line. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 33.3%. LYV Q3 performance is likely to have benefited from pent-up demand for live events and robust ticket sales in the United States and the U.K. Previously, the company announced that its U.S. concerts are now fully open.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmbdgr/two_plays_for_tomorrow_king_me_or_guh_yolo_airbnb/

Centerfold is PLBYs answer to OnlyFans. 

There will be an e-commerce connection with the Playboy brand attached to the platform also so users can purchase products and merchandise. Theyre already taking advantage of the NFT wave and have plenty of original content that can be sold as such.

Consider that OnlyFans did $2 billion in revenue in 2020. PLBY did less that $50 million. Thats 40x let that sink in!!!

If Cenrefold even does half OnlyFans revenue, could the stock 20x?!

This was a random guide I clicked on that explains the basics and most fundamentals of options trading.

In less than a month I took 600 in one account and turned it into 5k. In another account I opened last Friday(10/29), I signed up and deposited $100 bucks, got a free $170 JPM share and bought a $92 call on the SPY (469c 11/19) that is up 150%. The account now sits at $410 dollars. All of these gains with my thesis's for call buying with past failures and gains this year has taught me a lot. Everyone can make money, you just need to focus.

I  cant figure this one out, MGM beat earnings so I am hopeful.  DraftKings pays a ton for advertising, PENN counts on portnoy and barstool.  Their sportsbook is now available in nine states, and will continue to grow.  I dont think they can beat out DraftKings, but there is plenty of pie to go around when it comes to gambling.  Is PENN overvalued at its current price, or will we see it break 100$ soon?  Portnoy is annoying at times but a master marketer he is.

 Q3 estimates:  EPS is seen dropping 20% to 64 cents, even as sales are expected to gain 34% to $1.51 billion.

I am interested to see where The 2 Billion spent on The Score shows up, as well as hear them explain on the call tomorrow how they plan to integrate this acquisition to optimize revenue growth.  

I am encouraged by the consistent casino expansion, as well as the sportsbook growth now launching in several states.  I am discouraged that they havent closed the deal on New York, and the current stock price.  

The house always wins, and I am hoping PENN does as well.  Thoughts?

TLDR: Think of what would good society could do with all the hundreds of billions available if Bezos, Musk, and Gates gave up all their wealth except for 400k fair annual salary. We could fix a lot of issues with funds freed up from the C-levels taking a pay cut, right? Well, they'll likely never accept one.

What I'm suggesting is that we don't need to take it from them, or ask them for it, or wait for laws to change to tax them. All we have to do is stop giving them our money in the first place.

What option have they really left us with? We are going to create a new system using what's available to us right now where we do business only with those who willingly agree to control their own greed, pay employees higher wages, rebalance hours for more personal growth, and who advocate for basic human necessities as rights.

ONA is a nexus of businesses that support one another, founded from a single belief.

That all humans, regardless of any superficial and illusory differences we experience, come from a single source. We acknowledge that we are a single unit in this universe, on this planet, and willingly choose to let go of our individual greed in order to operate our businesses on a united front that delivers a better standard of living for all.

Our mission is **The Right To Thrive Directive (TRTD).** TRTD states that there are **5 Rights To All, Due From All**. These Rights are:

**1.** **Health Care**

**2.** **Housing**

**3.** **Healthy Environment (Clean air and water)**

**4.** **Sustenance (Food, Water, Clothing)**

**5.** **Education**

There are 3 key principles which all ONA businesses adhere to in order to fulfill TRTD:

**1.** **Maximum Wage.** $400k USD maximum annual salary for all positions top to bottom with no possibility for any further compensation via bonuses, stock options, or any other compensation scheme.

**2.** **Well-Being comes before Profit.** All the resources saved by capping high level salaries are directly invested back into the company and community in the form of higher wages for all employees, increased benefits, and increased work-life balance, as well as better products for consumers and the environment.

**3.** **Separation of Business and Government.** We pay our taxes, not our politicians. No ONA business will ever make political contributions of any kind to any campaign, organization, or individual. ONA businesses pay their full taxes as required by law and adhere to regulations, but otherwise have no financial interaction with the government or it's members.

We seek to provide a world we can all thrive in. We ask and coerce no one for anything. Let the wealthy keep their wealth. We are simply done doing business with entities who believe that hoarding wealth, destroying lives and the planet for their own profit, or for any reason, are acceptable actions.

As we provide better work environments for our employees, more will leave the existing system and join us. Consumers will follow out of self-interest and virtue.

This happens as fast as we decide to start making it happen for ourselves.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That's it. Of course, these businesses operate in the world as is right now, under all existing laws, competing against existing businesses. Other than that, there's no loopholes, no games.

I went ahead and compiled all my trades for the year and plotted the amount invested on the trade vs the amount gained or lost. 

What I found is that I take profits too soon and don't stop losses fast enough. I've included a picture of the plots I made.  I also found my biggest losses were same day or same week expiring calls, especially in the SPY.  My biggest gains were calls I bought 2-6 weeks out and sold more than a week out, close to earnings.

Most of my moderate gains are security trades.

I guess this could be a useful analysis for others who are wondering more about their habits and what they could do to improve themselves.

Super basic TA here but a few good things to note.

1. First thing we see is the MACD, this indicator is based on moving averages and the tendency of averages to ""cross over"" showing momentum in either one direction or the other. It has actually been bearish since June. Which is true because since the peak, we have only been averaging down. The good news is this is showing a strong momentum upwards again finally with a crossover getting ready to happen. The August run shows some upwards momentum but never showed a crossover. A real crossover can be the start of another big run.
2. Next we see the TTM indicator, which is a consolidation and volatility indicator. When consolidation happens it generally leads to some sort of break out, either up or down, especially with a highly volatile stock. The crazy thing is that even the run up this week, TTM is still not showing a strong upwards movement. If we do cross into green we can expect to carry it well.
3. Last we see the RSI, this is a measure of how over-sold or over-bought a stock may be. The lower this dips the more likely it will rebound, and vise versa. MACD and TTM can usually only be real strong when the RSI still looks reasonable, momentum can quickly end when the stock becomes over-bought and over-valued. Well RSI is still within reason, It is still below where it was during the last few runs ups, showing that there is still room to run, if we run to the RSI levels we were at it gives up room to reach $250-$300 or more, and once that happens no telling where this can go. RSI re-evaluates everyday so seeing it jump today is actually not so bad. Tomorrow it could run the same amount and show less movement on the RSI, gaining us more room.

My opinion? We see another big run in the next days/ weeks. We could be approaching buy button lock down levels again. Get in while you can..

All in all I expect it to be up 20% tomorrow. Took out my original 15k riding out the rest. .

Some of you may be thinking I'm about to say short the hell out of it, but ima say the complete opposite. Since there are so many people shorting the stock if it goes up then they buy and then cover which already shoots the price up. The only problem is it doesn't look like it going to head up. buuuuuttttttt if we all start throwing our savings into it the price will skyrocket cause more shorts to cover causing it to go even higher.

To offset some more aggressive plays, I've been trying to be good and put at least some of my profits into ""boring"" (i.e. no meme, no squeeze) money makers. Had put $300k into $MSFT, but then came across $NEWT, did very light DD, and per my usual said fuck it and swapped my $MSFT for 10k shares of $NEWT @ $30.68 (transaction date: Today, 3 Nov)

Looks like 4Q dividend is at $1+/share (I know, dividends not sexy talk here, but damn, close to 14% per annual). About 82% SP increase 1yr, and that's not including dividend (looks like was on track for more than 100%).  Has had decent ongoing SP gains. Earnings on the 8th. Have had margins shrink but keep surprising on earnings. I'm starting DD... Anyone have thoughts? 

I figured worst case I'll extract $10k in December, and sure seems there's even more value to extract with people jumping in as we approach the ex-Div date 16 DEC. I know, some may say wait until after earnings, there's no rush.  Well, fuck it, I'm feeling this one.  I'm banking we can get up another 10-15% easy heading into December, but if earnings surprise again, could be looking at 20%+.

Maybe someone here with at least a single wrinkle can provide an assist but, I got into this stock the other day for no other reason that it was running up on my scanner and Im broke so I bought 100 shares of it and 1 $7.50 strike call, because thats what I do when Im running low on cash apparently.

I saw that they had their earnings today after market, so I assume at least some people knew that they were going to do well. And they did. 

Pretty focking well, apparently. 

Per the TD news section: 

 \&gt;&gt;&gt;ION Geophysical (NYSE:[IO](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IO#NYSE))  reported quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $(0.24) by **120.83 percent**. This is a **104.31 percent increase** over losses of $(1.16) per share from the same period last year. The company reported **quarterly sales of $44.40 million** which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $27.79 million by **59.77 percent**. **This is a 173.50 percent increase over sales of $16.23 million the same period last year.**&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

I dont know enough about this company to list this as DD, however, when you beat your expectations by 120%, I cant imagine they are doings things wrong. But what I DO know is, the stock is currently trading under $3.00 and has 29.7 million shares. I'm expectation some volatility tomorrow. Dont know if my single call will print but, they usually dont so Im not emotionally attached. I just convince myself that Im a call option collector and buy them as a hobby. \*crying inside\*

**The Setup**

DWAC is a SPAC which recently made headlines for hitting $175/share on the news that it was slated to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). Currently, it is trading at \~$60/share (6x NAV).

**The Merger Target**

TMTG presented an ambitious deck wherein they would position themselves as the non-PC equivalent to Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, CNN, and the digital payments industry. They do not technically have a product or business plan. Because they presented no projections (they have no dollar signs within their deck), financial analysis of their business plan is impossible.

Love or hate the man, it has not been fun to be an investor in or creditor to Donald Trump. Few, if any banks on wall street lend to him, as he has a long history of paying him back. His entire goal in this SPAC is to maximize value to himself. He can screw his bagholders and enrich himself by leveraging the current share price to argue that, based on the share price, TMTG should be worth more than it is under the current deal. He can negotiate a new deal, and reduce the percentage of the company included in the final merger deal.

**Market dynamics**

It has now closed above $59 for 8 consecutive days, maintaining a sustained inflated value for a longer period at a higher level than any other SPAC. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DWAC/history?p=DWAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DWAC/history?p=DWAC)

Currently there are 5.2m shares short, on a float of 28.75 million shares of common stock and 14.375 millions warrants . Current daily volume sits \~10M down from a high of \~500M.

**The Setup** 

DWAC is a SPAC which recently made headlines for hitting $175/share on the news that it was slated to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). Currently, it is trading at \~$60/share (6x NAV). 

**The Merger Target**

TMTG presented an ambitious deck wherein they would position themselves as the non-PC equivalent to Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, CNN, and the digital payments industry. They do not technically have a product or business plan.

1,"11/04/2021, 06:33:45",Does this theory about economic crashes hold true?,DumbNBANephew,"I'm a super noob, but I've looked at a crashes and the situations surrounding them. I think that most crashes happen simply because of lack of capital/money to support expected market growth. Let me explain.

The stock market booms, so people get enticed to buy more stocks. In turn, the market booms again creating a cycle of growth followed by increased investment. Crashes occur when the growth slows. Slow growth leads to people taking out money or investing less leading to further decrease in growth or losses.

At some point during the growth cycle, there is so much money already invested that there literally isn't enough additional money to invest back in, causing the cycle to take a downward turn. The only way to add more money into the market and keep the cycle going is to print more money leading to inflation. At some point you can't do that anymore without massive inflation and that's when the real crash cycle starts. 

Once we hit this critical point where there just isn't enough money to invest anymore, the stock market tumbles, causing people to panic sell, which further causes the stock market to tumble. Cycles of this then lead to a crash.

In the great depression, banks stopped investing to hold inflation in check, causing a decrease in investments, leading to the crash. In the dot com crash, prices were so high that people couldnt invest more, again leading to the same crash cycle. Same with the 2008 housing crash.

The real value of any asset is so drastically different from it's perceived value that it causes these spikes and crashes. Paperhand investors who simply invest to make a quick buck and start panic selling at the first sign of trouble are squarely to blame for this cycle.

We could probably look at all the money in circulation and compare it with all the money that's invested to find the critical point where there is so little ""liquid"" money left to sustain growth that a crash is inevitable.

Has anyone suggested this before (comparing money in circulation with money invested as a marker for an upcoming crash)? Does this theory make sense?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qm65ds/does_this_theory_about_economic_crashes_hold_true/

3 Nov 2021

* Stocks climbed to a record after the Fed signaled that monetary policy will remain accommodative even as the central bank starts reducing its massive bond-buying program this month.
* The S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ 100, and Russell 2000 all closed at all-time highs for the second straight session, a feat not seen since January 2018. The yield curve steepened after Fed Chair Jerome Powell sought to emphasise that the tapering decision does not imply that rate rises are imminent. He stated that officials can be patient with tightening, but will not hesitate to act if inflation warrants it. The dollar dropped.
* Traders mostly kept their bets on the timing of interest-rate hikes at the level they were at before the decision. Rate rises of around 55 basis points are predicted by money-market derivatives by the end of 2022. According to overnight index swaps, the first raise is expected around July, with a roughly 70% likelihood of occurring the month earlier.
* On Wednesday, the Treasury revealed the first decline in its quarterly sale of longer-term debt in more than five years, showing reduced borrowing needs as the wave of pandemic-relief spending recedes.
* Companies in the United States created the most jobs in four months, indicating that employers are making headway in filling a near-record number of unfilled positions. The figures come ahead of the Labor Department's monthly employment report, which is expected to indicate that private payrolls climbed by 408,000 in October. In October, service providers expanded at a record pace, fueled by solid demand and increased business activity.

1,"11/04/2021, 04:56:04",Offerpad (OPAD) Due Diligence,yuleen3,"Offerpad is an iBuyer of homes competing with Opendoor, Redfin, and Zillow not Zillow (lulz). By now everyone has heard of Zillow and their horrendous foray into iBuying. And while Zillow fucked up that does not mean it's competitors are in such dire straits. 
Now that Offerpad's primary competition is Opendoor let's review their respective Q2 results.

&amp;nbsp;


**Offerpad Second Quarter Results 2021:**

- Revenue increased 32% to $378.6 million

- Net income improved to $9.2 million, an increase of $16.6 million

- Adjusted EBITDA increased $16.8 million to a record $13.1 million

- Gross profit increased $33.0 million to $50.9 million, or 13.4% of revenue

**Opendoor Second Quarter Results 2021:**

- Revenue of $1.2 billion, up 59% versus 1Q21, with 3,481 total homes sold, up 41% versus 1Q21

- Net income of ($144) million, versus ($270) million in 1Q21

- Adjusted EBITDA of $26 million versus ($2) million in 1Q21; adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.2% versus (0.3%) in 1Q21

- Gross profit of $159 million, up 64% versus 1Q21; gross margin of 13.4%, up 40 basis points versus 1Q21

&amp;nbsp;

If we take a look at these numbers, OPEN has revenue of ~3x OPAD. OPEN Gross profit is also ~3x OPAD. However current values put the market cap of OPAD at ~1.75B while OPEN is valued at ~12.5B. OPAD seems be sold at a significant discount compared to it's competitor. Even if we place OPAD at 1/4 the value of OPEN that gives us a valuation of ~3.1B. 
OPEN does show a greater growth in revenue which partially explains the higher market cap multiplier. Likely OPEN is offering higher prices on homes and are therefore taking on more risk like Z to gain inventory. 

&amp;nbsp;

Stats available on [ibuyerstats](https://ibuyerstats.com/) paints a rosy picture for OPAD. On average OPAD is selling for $319K on $263K purchase (56K difference), OPEN selling for $373 on $330 purchase (43K difference), and Z is at $420K sold on $383K purchase (37K difference). Average OPAD homes also go pending in 11 days, OPEN in 29 days, and Z in 15 days. The quick list to pending shows that OPAD's homes are more appropriate priced then both OPEN and Z. The higher margin on purchase to sold also explains why they were profitable last quarter.
Another quote I found reinforcing the that OPAD is profitable at iBuying: ""They've proven that they have the most efficient model. Over $31,000 contribution profit per home"" 
Price target:
Most price target for OPAD are in the $10-$12 range with the latest at $12
&amp;nbsp;


**Continued Expansion:**


OPAD will be expanding into California next year. Just in the third quarter this year they have expanded into Columbia SC, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Ohio. [News](https://investor.offerpad.com/news-releases/)

&amp;nbsp;


**Conclusion:**

The housing market is large enough to house multiple iBuyers. OPAD does not need to beat OPEN to succeed, they just need to take a portion of the real estate market. OPAD are likely the most efficient iBuyer with the best grasp of fair market value for homes. They are currently **priced at 1x projected 2021 revenue**. This is a high growth company with expansions in progress and planned for next year. Expecting a great third quarter report from OPAD and a return to fair value ($12-$14 in my estimation). No reason a high growth company that is proving iBuying can be profitable should be trading at 1x projected 2021 revenue. Stock is down today likely in sympathy with Z, even though it benefits from having less competition.


&amp;nbsp;

**TDLR:** OPAD already profiting as a iBuyer with continued expansion, low market cap compared to peers, priced near 1x yearly revenue, and earnings on 11/10. Expect it to return to fair market value of $12-$14 (50%+ upside).

&amp;nbsp;


**DISCLAIMER: I own bunch of stock, calls, and covered puts. Rising interest rates, Z flooding the market with their overprice homes, FED's halting the purchase of MBS, underpaid workers being priced out of the market, stagnating fall and winter real estate market, etc are all inherent risks.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qm4191/offerpad_opad_due_diligence/

Autists, lend me your ears.

Pfizers guide for 2022 is 1.7 billion doses. See slide 35.

https://investors.pfizer.com/investors-overview/default.aspx

But if you notice, they are manufacturing 4 billion doses. That's means pfizer expects all these countries to execute the options on their contract for bi-annual boosters. This is just like the option the EU has on the contract below.

That means pfizers actual vaccine sales will double current guidance, and revenue will be 120B for FY2022 and beyond.

FY2021 REVENUE = 40B (VACCINE) + 40B (OTHER) = 80B

1,"11/04/2021, 04:37:33",Offerpad (OPAD) Due Diligence,yuleen3,"Offerpad is an iBuyer of homes competing with Opendoor, Redfin, and Zillow not Zillow (lulz). Yes this was a squeeze target for a short time in September. By now everyone has heard of Zillow and their horrendous foray into iBuying. And while Zillow fucked up that does not mean it's competitors are in such dire straits. 
Now that Offerpad's primary competition is Opendoor let's review their respective Q2 results.

&amp;nbsp;


**Offerpad Second Quarter Results 2021:**

- Revenue increased 32% to $378.6 million

- Net income improved to $9.2 million, an increase of $16.6 million

- Adjusted EBITDA increased $16.8 million to a record $13.1 million

- Gross profit increased $33.0 million to $50.9 million, or 13.4% of revenue

**Opendoor Second Quarter Results 2021:**

- Revenue of $1.2 billion, up 59% versus 1Q21, with 3,481 total homes sold, up 41% versus 1Q21

- Net income of ($144) million, versus ($270) million in 1Q21

- Adjusted EBITDA of $26 million versus ($2) million in 1Q21; adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.2% versus (0.3%) in 1Q21

- Gross profit of $159 million, up 64% versus 1Q21; gross margin of 13.4%, up 40 basis points versus 1Q21

&amp;nbsp;

If we take a look at these numbers, OPEN has revenue of ~3x OPAD. OPEN Gross profit is also ~3x OPAD. However current values put the market cap of OPAD at ~1.75B while OPEN is valued at ~12.5B. OPAD seems be sold at a significant discount compared to it's competitor. Even if we place OPAD at 1/4 the value of OPEN that gives us a valuation of ~3.1B. 
OPEN does show a greater growth in revenue which partially explains the higher market cap multiplier. Likely OPEN is offering higher prices on homes and are therefore taking on more risk like Z to gain inventory. 

&amp;nbsp;

Stats available on [ibuyerstats](https://ibuyerstats.com/) paints a rosy picture for OPAD. On average OPAD is selling for $319K on $263K purchase (56K difference), OPEN selling for $373 on $330 purchase (43K difference), and Z is at $420K sold on $383K purchase (37K difference). Average OPAD homes also go pending in 11 days, OPEN in 29 days, and Z in 15 days. The quick list to pending shows that OPAD's homes are more appropriate priced then both OPEN and Z. The higher margin on purchase to sold also explains why they were profitable last quarter.
Another quote I found reinforcing the that OPAD is profitable at iBuying: ""They've proven that they have the most efficient model. Over $31,000 contribution profit per home"" [article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/30/heres-1-stock-with-10x-potential-i-just-bought/)

&amp;nbsp;

**Price target:**
Most price target for OPAD are in the $10-$12 range with the latest at $12.

&amp;nbsp;


**Continued Expansion:**


OPAD will be expanding into California next year. Just in the third quarter this year they have expanded into Columbia SC, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Ohio. [News](https://investor.offerpad.com/news-releases/)

&amp;nbsp;


**Conclusion:**

The housing market is large enough to house multiple iBuyers. OPAD does not need to beat OPEN to succeed, they just need to take a portion of the real estate market. OPAD are likely the most efficient iBuyer with the best grasp of fair market value for homes. They are currently **priced at 1x projected 2021 revenue**. This is a high growth company with expansions in progress and planned for next year. Expecting a great third quarter report from OPAD and a return to fair value ($12-$14 in my estimation). No reason a high growth company that is proving iBuying can be profitable should be trading at 1x projected 2021 revenue. Stock is down today likely in sympathy with Z, even though it benefits from having less competition.


&amp;nbsp;

**TDLR:** OPAD already profiting as a iBuyer with continued expansion, low market cap compared to peers, priced near 1x yearly revenue, and earnings on 11/10. Expect it to return to fair market value of $12-$14 (50%+ upside).

Deflation is the name of the game,stonks-always-go-up,"What else do I need to say the debt cycle has been prediction a deflationary depression since 99 but the fed and the government at large knows that deflation means depression and inflation means recession. 

So these fucks are tryna print as much moneys as they can do the can lower the gap between actual float US dollars and debt based US dollars. If you count corporate debt even with the trillions we have printed during Covid we have like 5:1 or 6:1 debt to real US dollars. We saw how banks were getting fucked at the end of 2019 with the repo markets but they could trade bonds and treasuries during that time so they were relatively fine. But now the fed has bought up all the bonds and treasuries the banks need to trade during repo that if anything gets all fucky wucky we fucked for real for real. 

And with this artificial inflationary period we are in which has no real basis for why prices are rising the only reason they are is because you dumb asses are saying we in hyper inflation so business owners are capitalizing on your retardedness and lowering supply and increasing their prices. And once the market starts really crashing and banks got no moneys because debt starts defaulting you idiots wont be able to buy shit because prices are too high credit will be too hard to come buy as well as people dont have any money to pay back their existing credit rn so banks will get even more fucked which will cause even more deflation.

TL;DR: Just read the **bold text**.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Interest rate remains the same.** Unanimously approved to maintain it at 0.15 percent.
2. **Taper officially starts mid-November.** The System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of Treasury securities will remain at $80B and the agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at $40B until mid-November.
3. **The plan is to taper $10B and $5B each month.** The tapering will be $10B less for Treasury securities and $5B less for MBS, from mid-November to mid-December. Then they'll taper another $10B and $5B.
4. **If that plan remains, taper will end in July 2022.** Although they will evaluate it regularly.
5. **Keep an eye on those numbers ($10B &amp; $5B).** If in a future meeting they say they'll taper $15B &amp; $7.5B, then they are tapering faster and can spook some investors. If it's lower, then they're tapering at a slower pace.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started to keep track of the FOMC press releases and minutes. The press releases are almost boilerplate, but I found some small differences between this one (Nov 3) and the previous one (Sep 22).

On Sep 22, the [press release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf) stated:

&gt;The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain.

On Nov 3, it now says:

&gt;The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations **and an easing of supply constraints** are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remain.

Meaning? **They used to only mention the virus. Now they're also mentioning the supply constraints.**

Also, on Sep 22, the press release stated:

&gt;Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.

But on Nov 3, it now says:

&gt;Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are **expected to be transitory**.

Meaning? It might be a small change, but remember that these press releases are almost boilerplate. **They specifically changed the wording from 'transitory' to 'expected to be transitory.'**

1,"11/04/2021, 03:43:57",3 Reasons Sundial Growers ($SNDL) Could Be a Bigger Winner Than AMC Over the Next Months,giov1234,"TLDR: =  but read anyways. 

My monkey brain has been thinking to a list of reasons why $SNDL could be the next rocket ready to take off  to tendie town, better than AMC. 

What you are going to read it's not about a close contest whatsoever based on year-to-date performance. Sundial Growers (NASDAQ: SNDL) has certainly been a big winner so far this year with its shares nearly doubling in value after soaring more than 500% at one point. But AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) easily beats Sundial with a jaw-dropping gain of more than 2,400%.  


However, the past is the past. What really matters for investors is how a stock might perform going forward. Here are three reasons why Sundial Growers could be a bigger winner than AMC over the next months 

https://preview.redd.it/4q34t6r4cfx71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f38d3e169b41905ebce7b8594107f880521c8b7d

#  1. The trend is its friend

I don't doubt that AMC's financial fortunes will improve in 2021 and 2022 as moviegoers return to theaters;  but what happens to the company and its stock once demand reaches pre-pandemic levels? The number of tickets sold each year was declining before COVID-19 hit. There isn't a compelling reason to think the trend will reverse course in the future.  


Meanwhile, the trend is a friend to Sundial Growers. Even with the shutdowns in 2020,  in Canada the total adult-use cannnabis sales more than doubled year over year. Cannabis market researcher Brightfield Group projects that adult-use cannabis sales will jump another 60% by the end of this year. 

 To be sure, Sundial's revenue didn't increase in 2020. Several of the company's problems were self-inflicted, furthermore pricing pressures in the Canadian cannabis market also presented a challenge. Sundial has made changes to improve its cultivation and focuses on more attractive market segments.

It's a lot easier to succeed when the overall trend works to your advantage. That's the case for Sundial but isn't for AMC.

# 2. A less lofty valuation

Sundial isn't a cheap stock by any stretch of the imagination. Its shares currently trade at 11 times sales. We can't use earnings-based valuation metrics, because the company isn't profitable yet.  


While Sundial's price-to-sales (P/S) multiple is steep, it's still lower than several other Canadian marijuana stocks. For example, Canopy Growth's shares trade at nearly 20 times sales. Cronos Group's P/S ratio is more than 58.

More importantly, Sundial's valuation is much cheaper than AMC's. Shares of the theater chain operator currently trade at more than 22 times sales.  


Will AMC's P/S ratio improve? I think that's a near certainty to happen as the company's sales rebound. However, I expect that Sundial's sales will also increase. SInce the cannabis operator's valuation isn't as lofty as AMC's is, its stock could perform better as its sales rise.

# 3. The possibility of a game changer

I think that there's a real possibility that a game changer could be on the way -- one that could directly benefit Sundial Growers. The U.S. could implement federal cannabis reform that paves the way for Canadian companies to enter the U.S. cannabis market.  


In my view, we will see a flurry of mergers and acquisitions if this happens. I expect that Sundial will be among the Canadian cannabis companies that quickly move to expand south of the border.

There's no guarantee that Sundial would be successful in the U.S. market, if the federal cannabis reform would be enacted. However, the opening up of such a huge new opportunity for the company would likely send its shares through the roof   


**Is there a similar potential game changer for AMC? I don't think so.**  


Putting the hype aside  


Sundial could very well be a bigger winner than AMC over the next five years for the three reasons mentioned above. 

The company still faces significant challenges to turn its cannabis business around. It also will likely have to further dilute its stock to raise additional capital for investing in other cannabis businesses. My take is that there are better stocks to buy right now that will be bigger winners than both Sundial and AMC over the next few years.

  
Here's The Marijuana Stock You've Been Waiting For  
A little-known Canadian company just unlocked what some experts think could be the key to profiting off the coming marijuana boom.  


**And make no mistake  it is coming**. Maybe you should think about asking your wife's boyfriend to lend you some money to put on SNDL  


Cannabis legalization is sweeping over North America  15 states plus Washington, D.C., have all legalized recreational marijuana over the last few years, and full legalization came to Canada in October 2018.  


And one under-the-radar Canadian company is poised to explode from this coming marijuana revolution.  


A **game-changing deal** just went down between the Ontario government and this powerhouse company...and you need to hear this story today if you have even considered investing in pot stocks.

1,"11/04/2021, 03:43:21",Great post about SAVA on Yahoo by End2War,Poppy13132,"Courtesy End2War:

**End2War** \[11:30 AM, November 3, 2021) on Yahoo SAVA page\]

My best guess at what is happening. SAVA is in a quiet period. They are not releasing news about anything. They are not updating their September Corporate Presentation on their web page (which they normally update every month). Barbier told us a long time ago that they are not intending to try to market or distribute Simufilam if it is approved, and that they would look for a partner. They already partenered with a well known manufacturing entity to make Simufilam; and they partnered with a well known CRO for doing the PH3 trials. Barbier told shareholders they should expect a non-dilutive cash flow coming to SAVA in ""weeks or months"" which signaled they were in discussions with a potential partner (just before the CP was filed). SAVA could use a big pharma partner (such as, e.g., PFE) to help with getting the clinical sites lined up for the PH3 trials but has been working on that themselves, adding sites and slowly bringing them on line to ""recruting"" as they have already ""initiated"" the PH3 trials.

Since the CP, a lot of damage to the PPS was done, but no damage to Simufilam's prospects with the FDA (IMO), so I think we should assume SAVA continues to work diligently on the PH 3 start up, and they are focused on the 1 year version which will get a faster result. The FDA will, in due course, formally dismiss the meritless and sperious CP, and it is likely the courts will dismiss the phoney class actions. No big pharma will think either of those presents any problems for Simufilam. 

PFE formally decided to abandon their inhouse work on CNS indications. Kupiec, who was PFE's lead in that department, was hired by SAVA to take over guiding Simufilam through PH 3. PFE just held their CC and said they were looking for opportunities, and indeed, they are moving on some CNS opportunities, for example, they licensed VYGRs gene tech and they hold/held $9.64% of the stock of CRTX. Clearly they have an interest in CNS indications being developed by third parties. They have strong connections to SAVA, not only through Kupiec, but also they had a partnership with SAVA/Barbier when SAVA was developing their pain drug that the FDA ultimately would not approve because of the change in attitude about oxicodine. This prior partnership means to me that PFE knows Barbier and vice versa. So, IMO, PFE would be one of the top players that might partner (or simply do a BO) with SAVA. I don't think a BO is likely because of several things, including Barbier said that non-dilutive funding was coming. 

So, with PH3 started, and SAVA holding a lot of unreleased OL data on Simufilam, I strongly suspect the unreleased data confirms the PH2b readouts, i.e., clear safety and strong cognitive improvements at 12 months (and now they have data that would go even out to 15 months which they can share with Big Pharma with NDAs). 

The stakes are so high, I am sure Barbier would be shoping to several BP candidates. How much longer will they all sit by and leave Simufilam for someone else to win the prize. It is game theory time, and SAVA must realize they hold all the cards at this point. 

IMHO, the above facts suggest something is about to happen, and the sudden explosion of stock movement seems also to signify that I am not the only one that thinks so. I added to my SAVA position today, and I think an announcement may come at CTAD or sooner. Please don't rely on my guessing. You should only buy SAVA based on your own research and DD not not rely on posters. GLTY

# What is SuRo Capital (SSSS)?

They are similar to a private equity firm that funds start-ups and realizes profits post IPO. At the same time, they are publicly traded which essentially allows their investors to participate in venture capital. Because they are a regulated investment company, they are ***required to distribute a large portion of profits to shareholders (big dividends!).***

# Supporting evidence

**1. Large special dividend was confirmed in Q2 2021 ER transcript.** Since this was only mentioned on the call, the market likely has not priced the dividend in yet.

*Processing img osqvoawohfx71...*

**2. Upside is current price of \~$14.50 plus $2.50 dividend which is about $17/share.** In a portfolio update on 10/4, Q3 net asset value (NAV) was estimated to be between $14.15 to $15 per share. The price is currently within that range, so the upside on price should be about the amount of dividend declared in the ER plus any NAV surplus. Historically, price tends to run higher than the special dividend amount.

If BBBY is going to buy back $1 billion worth of their stock, when the stock was $16, that would take 62.5m shares out of circulation.  If their average cost per share ends up around $20 with the pop yesterday/today that is 50m or 50% of the float, gone.

*What is SuRo Capital (SSSS)?*

They are similar to a private equity firm that funds start-ups and realizes profits post IPO. At the same time, they are publicly traded which essentially allows their investors to participate in venture capital. Because they are a regulated investment company, they are ***required to distribute a large portion of profits to shareholders (big dividends!).***

*Supporting evidence*

**1. Large special dividend was confirmed in Q2 2021 ER transcript.** Since this was only mentioned on the call, the market likely has not priced the dividend in yet.

**2. Upside is current price of \~$14.50 plus $2.50 dividend which is about $17/share.** In a portfolio update on 10/4, Q3 net asset value (NAV) was estimated to be between $14.15 to $15 per share. The price is currently within that range, so the upside on price should be about the amount of dividend declared in the ER plus any NAV surplus. Historically, price tends to run higher than the special dividend amount.

On the daily chart, we observe that the price has almost reached the support line in the local uptrend. In this situation, consider the possible outcomes of the future movement.

The asset is ambiguous, after a huge drop in the asset over the past 5 months, an attractive upward local trend has been appeared on the chart, but this is not a reason to buy with all the money. In case of a rebound from support, do not rush to enter into a trade, if there is such a desire, wait for the breakdown of $ 204.94, as a flat is possible. When setting a target, I recommend paying attention to the level of $ 208.1, this is a possible resistance, in the area of which the price will feel oscillation. 

More profitable targets: $210.58 (2.7%), $215.7 (5.2%)

Although the local trend is upward, bearish resistance is still great, still the price has been falling for a very long time, and the growth is not strong yet. Further downward movement will be confirmed by the breakdown of $201.14. We are looking at $198.85, there may be a pullback from this level. 

Targets are $196.34 (2.3%), $192.47 (4.2%)

In case of entering a trade, do not forget about the stop loss. I recommend taking more, as the volatility is quite high.

The largest supplier of electricity in Chile, and they are putting a strong step towards becoming carbon neutral by 2030.  Some of the factors to support the bullish thesis:

Strong Revenue:

3.21 Billion Dollars with quarter increase of 141% year by year. This number will only go up as revenues increase with the recent opening of Chile. Compare that to the market revenue of 2.87B, it becomes obvious the ENIC is very undervalued.

Green Initative

The market is wet and horny for green stocks and ENIC is a largely ignored play- unil now. They are putting strong strides to make themselves greener.

Reopening Play:

Chile has 85 % population at least with 1 dose, and 77 % with 2 doses. As the country opens, more businesses, offices, and commercial properties will open- which requires energy, and ENIC is the only option in town for that.

$ATVI has a PE of 19\~ now after earnings.

Lets compare to $TTWOs overall picture. It's got one side of things, basketball, civ6, bioshock, some mobile games. Basically games people played a year ago and stopped playing recently.

It's main revenue stream is users playing GTAV.

They've been milking the GTA5 community for a long time, years. Then Covid hit, everyone plays more GTA5, they're geniuses. Now that COVID is over, the milks gone bad, people are leaving their house again, they're stuck with their pants down with declining user growth.

It's nearly half of what it was last year, yet its only 8% down from February highs. In peak November, we're at like 120k users instead of last years 258k users. that's a loss of like 60% YoY for the same time. 

So what could make the stock go up after hours? maybe some GTA6 news? Seems unlikely, reports are out that suggest 2024/2025 release date.

My expectations are lower guidance, lower monthly active users, and not enough shit in the near term pipeline to justify a valuation +50% higher than $ATVI.

As we all can agree, it takes courage, perseverance, and most importantly it takes conscientiousness. To be there is well, its beyond epic.  

Short squeeze definition  

Short selling refers to the sale of a security that the seller does not own, where the delivered security is borrowed by the short seller. The intention is to buy the security at a lower price than that at which the security was sold short. When the price of the security rises, the short seller can incur significant losses as the downside potential due to a price rise is unlimited.

In order to lock-in a profit, or avoid further losses (where the price of the security has gone up), short sellers need to cover a short position. This involves buying securities in the market and returning the borrowed stock to the lender. The short seller may also be forced to cover positions due to failure to meet a margin call or when the security lender recalls the stock. The resulting buying pressure can drive prices higher in a phenomenon known as a short squeeze.

While fears of a short squeeze may act as a constraint on short sale activity, particularly in the event of manipulative short squeezes by original buyers who would benefit from inflated prices, the role of short sellers is considered a vital market practice to keep stock prices in-line with fair value.

The actual occurrence of a squeeze is a debatable subject. One such issue arises from general

informed market trading activity which can easily be misconstrued as a short squeeze. As such, there is a clear need to identify specific characteristics to isolate their existence. However, many differing definitions are used in practice, forcing the need for a systematic identification process.

Naked short sales (where the security has not been located and/or borrowed in advance) are now banned in most jurisdictions across the globe. As a result, short sellers almost always need to borrow stock, and as such the resulting lending data provides a close proxy for short selling volumes.

Securities lending is a market practice whereby securities are temporarily transferred by the lender to the borrower. The borrower is obliged to return the securities either on demand or at the end of any pre- agreed term. Securities lending operates as an over the counter market.

As Elon said:  

u cant sell houses u dont own

u cant sell cars u dont own

but  

u \*can\* sell stock u dont own!?

this is bs  shorting is a scam

legal only for vestigial reasons

Naked shorts  

The following explains how a naked short sale occurs:

When investors call a broker to arrange to borrow stock to short, they are aware that short sales are subject to a standard three-day settlement period. This means the sell-side broker has three days to deliver the shares to the investor.

The broker is supposed to locate shares available to short prior to executing a short sale and make a determination that the shares will be delivered to the investor within the three- day settlement window. However, there are certain exceptions to that rule.

Some shares are on an Easy to Borrow list. For a stock on that list, investors can execute a short sale and the broker does not specifically have to locate, or contact the source of the shares that are being shorted. The broker has a blanket assurance about the borrowing capability for that security.

There is also a Hard to Borrow list for securities that are difficult, or unavailable, to borrow. To short stocks on the Hard to Borrow list, brokers have to take additional steps to ensure that the stock is available to be shorted.

If, for whatever reason, the shares are not delivered within the three-day settlement window, this is called a fail to deliver.

That fail to deliver essentially leaves the short- seller naked, meaning he did not actually possess the shares he has sold.If shares have not been delivered for 13 days after a transaction has occurred, the broker must buy them back.

Gamma squeeze building on $SAVA

When SAVAges buy many out of the money call options, this can trigger gamma squeeze. When a market maker sell a call option, they often hedge their risk by going long the underlying stock. Prices of out of the many option moves less than the underlying stock. You sure how the option price will move given a move in stock price is called Delta. Options fat out-of-the money have low delta (option doesnt move until it creeps closer to in the money) but in-the money options have high deltas since they will move in lock step with stock (other things equal).   

In SAVA case, once price moves we will have many OTM calls. Since SAVA calls will be far out of the money, market makers will assume that they are safe and not fully hedge their positions. In others words they will think that this is just a fluke. Basically, any out of the money call you buy, market maker will be naked on, they wont hedge and they will collect the premium (or so they think).

Once stock moves up GAMMA will kick in. Gamma is a measure of how fast Delta is accelerating and as the stock got nearer and never to the strike price, gamma moves dramatically, and market makers will be left scrambling to cover these naked positions. In addition you have to add short interest to this.  

Market maker will be caught in and short squeeze and a nee too long the stock at any price. As market maker buys stock and the short cover, price will explode.

We have a lot of very talented people making some very talented memes. I wanted to aggregate some of the best over the past 2 years.

It would be a shame to let our memes go unseen by the current class of degenerates, so please add the best memes youve seen in the comments!

Bonus points: I am looking for a meme that was around here a while ago about how degenerate investors outperformed everyone. It was very popular and had the line: plane house is empty, but maybe one day plane house be full and showed how dumb money makes decisions.

Lets see if we can aggregate some memes!!

I wanted to make a post highlighting a move made by JPM this afternoon to [restrict trading in US MSO's not operating on the Nasdaq, NYSE or TSX.](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-jpmorgan-restrict-trading-us-cannabis-stocks-letter-2021-11-02/)

*The  saga drew regulatory scrutiny and prompted banks across Wall Street to  review how much risk they are prepared to take on in their prime  brokerage businesses.""*

To me, this is a clear signal that something very big is about to happen in this space.

**UP OR DOWN?**

Being  that cannabis is about 70% off its highs from earlier this year, I  struggle with how we can go much lower especially with every analyst PT well above our current levels.

Its currently November and we have a must pass NDAA that has cannabis banking reform worked in through the SAFE banking act.

Banking  has long been viewed as the ultimate catalyst for this sector. There is  a ton of money that wants to invest but is not allowed to enter due to  federal regulations. JPM solidifies this statement with today's move.

There  has been a lot of discussion as to whether or not SAFE banking would  make it into the final NDAA. Schumer recently stated that he has no  issues with safe banking, assuming he can get broad reform attached and  social equity included.

Just last  weekend, minority owned cannabis businesses pleaded with federal  regulators to pass SAFE banking into the NDAA as social equity is  already being worked into many state regulations, and not having access  to a bank account is a much larger threat to their businesses.

I  feel there is enough momentum on both sides to see this through in  2021. GOP states are scrambling to add legalization legislation. Schumer  will read the room and either get broader reform (legalization) into  the NDAA or he will allow SAFE banking to pass as its absolutely  necessary.

**WHO DOES THIS HURT?**

Right now, any cannabis stock not operating on the Nasdaq, TSX or NYSE.

In short, multi-state operators (MSO's) are about to get fucked really hard.

They  are going to lose access to shareholder capital and this will really  slow their ability to scale against global competitors.

**WHO DOES THIS BENEFIT?**

Mother fucking Tilray.

MSO's in need of capital will now need to look towards companies like Tilray when they're in a pinch and need a bailout.

Flush  with cash and a 4B/y revenue plan through acquisitions, I expect Tilray  to take advantage of this opportunity in a big way.

Additionally,  this should condense a very large investor pool down to the few  companies that have been able to gain access to the NYSE and the Nasdaq  creating a massive funnel to the likes of TLRY, CGC and (fuck me) ACB.

**HOW DOES** ***~~CITADEL~~*** **ARCHEGOS FACTOR IN?**

This is a preemptive move by JPM because they do not want to become the next credit suisse and get ass rammed by guys like *~~Ken Griffen~~* Bill Hwang and the fuckboys at *~~Citadel~~* Archegos.

**TILRAY, CITADEL and THE CORRELATION IN MEME STOCKS**

I  have been trading TLRY since november of last year following the  announcement of the APHA merger. I was long in APHA prior to the news  drop and shifted into TLRY shortly thereafter.

Anyone who spends their days with their eyes glued to memes can tell you there is absolutely a correlation in them all.

I believe, as many of you do, that this correlation comes from Citadel.

Tilray is currently the only cannabis company they have any exposure too, both short and long.

Why is this? CGC is the preferred hedge cunt play so why is TLRY their only cannastock?

***Because of GME. Because of AMC. Because retail cant fucking win.***

Following  the squeeze in GME many other short plays made massive moves. Tilray  was one of them, going all the way from 6 to 65 in just 4 months.

We  know that Citadel has a reputation of some seriously dank skulduggery  so we can assume that it was them who has been running the short ladder  from 65 all the way down to our current level of 10.50.

This  wouldn't have been all to difficult considering the TLRY float is 85%  owned by retail traders, they have the ability to short dark pools and they sell shares they do not own across multiple foreign exchanges (TSX and Frankfurt).

Using AI to trade in dark pools over multiple exchanges give them the ability to basket  memes and control losses where they have over exposed themselves by selling shares that dont actually exist.

The Tilray float prior to its merger with APHA was tiny, this is why I dumped APHA for TLRY following the merge news.

Combining  the two floats gave Citadel an opportunity to hide positions and  control the narrative. Being that this stock is owned mostly by retail  and most those retail cunts being us, they really couldn't help  themselves.

TLDR;

Knowing that citadel is just as long as they are short and understanding that  broad reform is right around the corner, it is my belief that JPM  believes a massive move to the upside is getting ready to happen in ALL  of cannabis and they want to minimize the risk should citadel or any  other bad actor decide to run cannabis to insane valuations such as Archegos did with DISCA and VIAC.

IF Citadel loses their battle with MEME's this could be their only out, which is why its their only long in the space.

With most investors in Cannabis being retail, JPM surely cant be protecting themselves from us. 

When we lose they take our house, no big deal.

1,"11/04/2021, 00:55:39","JPM, Cannabis and the MSO shill. The case for Tilray following MSO restrictions (credit to u/PenroseB)",palpythepimp,"
I wanted to make a post highlighting a move made by JPM this afternoon to restrict trading in US MSO's not operating on the Nasdaq, NYSE or TSX.

WHAT HAPPENED?

""Nov 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has  told prime brokerage clients it will no longer let them buy certain  U.S. cannabis-related securities beginning Nov. 8, according to a letter  seen by Reuters.

The move follows similar actions by other banks, including Credit Suisse, after the high-profile collapse of private fund Archegos Capital this year left several banks nursing losses.

The  saga drew regulatory scrutiny and prompted banks across Wall Street to  review how much risk they are prepared to take on in their prime  brokerage businesses.""

To me, this is a clear signal that something very big is about to happen in this space.

UP OR DOWN?

Being  that cannabis is about 70% off its highs from earlier this year, I  struggle with how we can go much lower especially with every analyst PT well above our current levels.

Its currently November and we have a must pass NDAA that has cannabis banking reform worked in through the SAFE banking act.

Banking  has long been viewed as the ultimate catalyst for this sector. There is  a ton of money that wants to invest but is not allowed to enter due to  federal regulations. JPM solidifies this statement with today's move.

There  has been a lot of discussion as to whether or not SAFE banking would  make it into the final NDAA. Schumer recently stated that he has no  issues with safe banking, assuming he can get broad reform attached and  social equity included.

Just last  weekend, minority owned cannabis businesses pleaded with federal  regulators to pass SAFE banking into the NDAA as social equity is  already being worked into many state regulations, and not having access  to a bank account is a much larger threat to their businesses.

I  feel there is enough momentum on both sides to see this through in  2021. GOP states are scrambling to add legalization legislation. Schumer  will read the room and either get broader reform (legalization) into  the NDAA or he will allow SAFE banking to pass as its absolutely  necessary.

WHO DOES THIS HURT?

Right now, any cannabis stock not operating on the Nasdaq, TSX or NYSE.

In short, multi-state operators (MSO's) are about to get fucked really hard.

They  are going to lose access to shareholder capital and this will really  slow their ability to scale against global competitors.

WHO DOES THIS BENEFIT?

Mother fucking Tilray.

MSO's in need of capital will now need to look towards companies like Tilray when they're in a pinch and need a bailout.

Flush  with cash and a 4B/y revenue plan through acquisitions, I expect Tilray  to take advantage of this opportunity in a big way.

Additionally,  this should condense a very large investor pool down to the few  companies that have been able to gain access to the NYSE and the Nasdaq  creating a massive funnel to the likes of TLRY, CGC and (fuck me) ACB.

HOW DOES CITADEL ARCHEGOS FACTOR IN?

This is a preemptive move by JPM because they do not want to become the next credit suisse and get ass rammed by guys like Ken Griffen Bill Hwang and the fuckboys at Citadel Archegos.

TILRAY, CITADEL and THE CORRELATION IN MEME STOCKS

I  have been trading TLRY since november of last year following the  announcement of the APHA merger. I was long in APHA prior to the news  drop and shifted into TLRY shortly thereafter.

Anyone who spends their days with their eyes glued to memes can tell you there is absolutely a correlation in them all.

I believe, as many of you do, that this correlation comes from Citadel.

Tilray is currently the only cannabis company they have any exposure too, both short and long.

Why is this? CGC is the preferred hedge cunt play so why is TLRY their only cannastock?

Because of GME. Because of AMC. Because retail cant fucking win.

Following  the squeeze in GME many other short plays made massive moves. Tilray  was one of them, going all the way from 6 to 65 in just 4 months.

We  know that Citadel has a reputation of some seriously dank skulduggery  so we can assume that it was them who has been running the short ladder  from 65 all the way down to our current level of 10.50.

This  wouldn't have been all to difficult considering the TLRY float is 85%  owned by retail traders, they have the ability to short dark pools and they sell shares they do not own across multiple foreign exchanges (TSX and Frankfurt).

Using AI to trade in dark pools over multiple exchanges give them the ability to basket  memes and control losses where they have over exposed themselves by selling shares that dont actually exist.

The Tilray float prior to its merger with APHA was tiny, this is why I dumped APHA for TLRY following the merge news.

Combining  the two floats gave Citadel an opportunity to hide positions and  control the narrative. Being that this stock is owned mostly by retail  and most those retail cunts being us, they really couldn't help  themselves.

TLDR;

Knowing that citadel is just as long as they are short and understanding that  broad reform is right around the corner, it is my belief that JPM  believes a massive move to the upside is getting ready to happen in ALL  of cannabis and they want to minimize the risk should citadel or any  other bad actor decide to run cannabis to insane valuations such as Archegos did with DISCA and VIAC.

IF Citadel loses their battle with MEME's this could be their only out, which is why its their only long in the space.

With most investors in Cannabis being retail, JPM surely cant be protecting themselves from us.

When we lose they take our house, no big deal.

When someone like Archegos or Citadel loses, everyone loses their house and its a very big deal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlyt3l/jpm_cannabis_and_the_mso_shill_the_case_for/

This is on top of a stupid discount with the stock being coupled to $ZG's downfall. This will de-couple.   


Keith Rabois: PayPal mafia, Musk and Thiel friend, edgy fuck-you attitude online. This man is somehow so under talked about in this thread and is one of the kings of tech and Twitter. Keith should be a legend of this sub. He is right time after time. He doesn't care about discourse. He just executes. Opendoor has been his long time baby, which he has waited to start to get the timing right. Co-founder, now executive chairman, and a Twitter account that is tweeting out borderline NMPI.   


Longterm, $OPEN is going to have similar / greater top line numbers as Walmart. People are concerned about a downturn in the housing market being non-survivable. Wrong. The model has been back-tested through the 2008 crisis and beyond. Opendoor can still make money. The collapse in housing markets are much slower than you want to believe, and with the right vertical model in place, Opendoor can make money while losing a couple of basis points. They are so misunderstood, and this is the discounted time to join.  


Opendoor has an actual model. They understand how to price homes and when to pull on/off on different regions, and they don't overreact to the market to end up fucked by 700 basis points ala Zillow. Opendoor also doesn't have the same fiduciary responsibility that Zillow does. They have to (and are) making this model work. Zillow simply had to pull out for two reasons: 1) they didn't know what they were doing. 2) they owed a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders to quit while they can and focus on their main model (which will also get swallowed in the coming years). This is now Opendoor's market to run with. Google ($OPEN) vs Yahoo.  


To the tweets. Rabois is addicted to Twitter. Similar to Elon, but different. In some ways more professional, in some ways more unhinged and quite a few red pilled based takes. Anyways, he's been obsessed with tweeting Q3 takes, while searching and favoriting $OPEN tweets, and engaging in discussion. He calls doubters stupid in public. Here are a few from the past few weeks:  


1. ""Opendoor does not lose money."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1450115678346924038?s=20)
2. ""wait until Nov 10 and you will concede I was correct"" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1453880268851404806?s=20)
3. ""nope.  TKO.  Opendoor is doing better than ever."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449792434062438406?s=20)
4. ""they are going to look like the Tesla cynics in 3 weeks."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449787713394253825?s=20)
5. ""Selling or shorting Opendoor due to Zillows flaws is akin to shorting Google due to Yahoos inability to monetize search well or return long tail queries properly."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1455564619494436870?s=20) 
   1. Note here: short numbers that kicked in after the Zillow earnings are not public yet, and will not be public before earnings. Give the action a look and you'll see a bunch of shorts likely kicked up, and will be put in a need to cover position based off the earnings and a longer short ratio.
6. ""LOL.  We are consistently profitable.  We know exactly what we are doing."" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449783187656355846?s=20)  


This is more than just pre-bragging earnings. Chairmen and founders used to be more discreet by taking lavish vacations before earnings. Then Michael Jung from NYU published research to connect behavior to upcoming releases and it all stopped. Keith is straight up dancing in public. He's celebrating Zillow taking a beating. He's also publicly called Zillow becoming a disaster [from the archives](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/984609468355719168?s=20).

Analysts like Opendoor. The cap table is ELITE. Real Estate agents provide negative value in a broken industry., which leads me to one final point. The effects of the tech industry and Keith's pinned tweet which he bases his career on:  


&gt;***Formula for startup success: Find large highly fragmented industry w low NPS; vertically integrate a solution to simplify value product.*** 

  
iBuying is just the entry. Cash flow heavy, with a potential to open up a MASSIVE vertical moat. Open has already completed 2 acqui-hires this year. This is a $5TN company in the making and it's currently valued at \~$13BN.   


If you're an agent in the industry and are mad about Opendoor, don't come in and say it won't work. You're wrong. Take your massive winning year and hedge against your job being automated away.

1,"11/04/2021, 00:26:55",All in on Meta,shockwave6969," 

Ill cut to the chase. Im all in on meta. Here is why:

Firstly, Meta is outrageously undervalued in its current state. I dont care if they use unethical targeted ads. Use your data to sell me things. I watched the entire whistleblower hearing and it was silly. Not only was she unable to provide specific documents, but her strongest argument was facebook bad because it makes people feel bad. Government help plz. The government was like yes this is a grave matter indeed. They wont do anything. The public will stop caring. In a month this will blow over into the dustbin of facebooks reputation and the stock will naturally ascend back to the p/e they deserve. If you give them a p/e of 30. The stock will sit right around $400 (current p/e 23).

But thats the boring shit. I really dont care about that. After all, Im ALL IN on this company. The metaverse is not a silly sci-fi idea. Its going to be real very soon, it will accelerate faster than you can imagine, and it will replace reality as you know it. Im about to explain exactly where this is going in the near future and the distant future. This is going to sound very dystopian, which I agree with, but Im not in the stock market to be moral.

**The VR explosion:** Its already happening and its accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and its starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023.

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moores law to the computer chip. Its been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if its lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

Okay, enough about current data. Where is this really going? Im not sold on it, it seems kinda dumb.

**The crazy shit:** The metaverse is not the successor to the internet, its the successor to reality. Within the decade we will see the metaverse really take shape, then youll begin to see the vision of where this is going with your own eyes. But if you want a preview, Ill show you.

1. The metaverse will be an exponential self-sustaining economy that will surpass the GDP of the entire world. Think of transactions in the metaverse for gaming, like CSGO skins. The skins are represented as NFTs. And are traded on the market. Your skins arent just for your game though. The metaverse is all connected, and you can take your CSGO skin and use it as an item in another game. You can take your genji skin and go to a concert. At the concert the person might sell T-shirts specific to that event which are also represented as NFTs. Businesses will begin to pop up in the metaverse. I already have several ideas, but will not be disclosing them here. Once people realize how easy it is to make money in the metaverse, much like the internet, there will be a mass migration. A gold rush like youve never seen. I could easily see another dot-com bubble level of excitement. The economy will rapidly grow. And as the metaverse becomes more and more real, it will only accelerate that growth. As more people join the metaverse, more major companies will need to change their business model to enter the metaverse in order to survive. Which will be a feedback loop that grows to unimaginable heights. If you want to get rich, be an early metaverse adopter and start a company that sells a service or product specifically useful for the metaverse. The real economy will transition more and more to the virtual and there will come a day before 2040 when the GDP of the metaverse surpasses that of the real world. And it wont stop there. Whoever runs the metaverse will have an economy larger than the entire world under their thumb.
2. What Meta wont tell you about the metaverse: By the time youve normalized living in the metaverse, you better not care about privacy anymore. I believe the idea of privacy will ultimately be discarded as the price of living.  In your headset, Meta will track your eye movements, your facial expressions, the way your body physically responds to the sensory input of the virtual world. Whether you like it or not, you are a predictable genetic algorithm. And when billions of data points about your response to input are measured, Meta will be able to build an artificial model of your expected output and know what you want before you want it. You might think, wow thats scary and really good for targeted advertising. And youd be right. But thats just the beginning.  

   1. Further future- 2030-2050: Once your being is analyzed as a data model (By an AI like a more powerful version of youtube recommended). At this point in time, AI has reached unprecedented capabilities. AI will build entire worlds for you, filled with things it knows you will enjoy, things youll want to buy, experiences youll want to have. A world far more interesting and exciting than the real one, tailored specifically to you.
   2. But your data will construct something even more bizarre. AI NPCs. Your best friends wont be homo sapiens. Theyll be AI indistinguishable from real people. Perhaps even alive themselves. Generated based on the data of your predictable personality model. Your true love. Someone literally perfect for you, will be an AI. And it will be incredible. You might think, *thats stupid this is stupid Im never going to fall in love with an AI*. You are wrong. And when youre there and the entity is in front of you in the virtual world. When you can touch them, and they can express emotion to you, you will understand. Your utopia is coming.
3. The metaverse will change what it means to be human. It will redefine our understanding of humanity and even gender. In the virtual world, there is no need to be a human. Your avatar can be an animal, a robot, an amoeba, an anime character, literally anything. People will soon feel better represented by your avatar than your real self. And as we cross that threshold the real world will seem more and more lack luster. The real world becomes a boring place where you have to live with this boring body that has to obey the laws of physics. This will further push the transition to the virtual world.
4. The transition from sedentary VR living to immortal consciousness. As people realize how incredible it is to live in the metaverse, the race for immortality will break out more powerfully than the space race. What is the race for immortality? It means to exist as pure data. To upload your consciousness into the metaverse directly, to abandon your feeble human body and live forever exploring the virtual world filled with real people and AI. The ever changing and evolving economy and ecosystem. To travel from universe as you please. If Meta is a part of this transition, then they will own the platform on which your mind exists. They will literally own your body in a sense. Privacy will be so far gone that its a wistful wish of the past, nor will you likely care. Meta will see everything, will know everything you are, everything you could ever want. And they will sell it to you.
5. The Fermi paradox: where are all the aliens? If there are so many worlds capable of supporting life, if there are quadrillions of planets in the galaxy. If theyve had billions of years to evolve, why dont we see signs of intelligent life in the universe? Why are we alone out here? Its not that intelligent life inherently drives itself to extinction. I highly doubt its that intelligent life is so absurdly rare that we are the only ones. The solution to the Fermi paradox is that there is no reason to ever travel beyond the solar system. A civilization capable of interstellar travel is capable of creating its own universe- unbound by the laws of physics and the vast distances between the stars. A civilization that can shape reality like gods through the virtual world. To exist as pure data consciousness in a network of supercomputers. Humanity will never travel beyond the solar system, not because we will go extinct, but because we will never need to.

Meta is a company paving the way to redefine the human species, to redefine existence, and to redefine our future. Meta will own the platform upon which our lives exist. This world is terrifying, strange, unbelievable, but also inevitable. And it will be beautiful. It may sound dystopian, but it is, in fact, the opposite. To exist as pure data in the metaverse is the end of death. It is the end of hunger. It is the end of humanity as we know it. On October 28th, 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced itself as a company fully dedicated to the metaverse. A day that will go in the history books as a turning point and the beginning of the new age. The world is changing, and it will only change more and more rapidly. The end is approaching, and so is the beginning. And Im ready to be a part of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qly6ze/all_in_on_meta/

1,"11/04/2021, 00:06:26",All in on Meta,shockwave6969," 

Ill cut to the chase. Im all in on meta. Here is why:

Firstly, Meta is outrageously undervalued in its current state. I dont care if they use unethical targeted ads. Use your data to sell me things. I watched the entire whistleblower hearing and it was silly. Not only was she unable to provide specific documents, but her strongest argument was Facebook bad because it makes people feel bad. Government help plz. The government was like yes this is a grave matter indeed. They wont do anything. The public will stop caring. In a month this will blow over into the dustbin of Facebooks reputation and the stock will naturally ascend back to the p/e they deserve. If you give them a p/e of 30. The stock will sit right around $400 (current p/e 23).

But thats the boring shit. I really dont care about that. After all, Im ALL IN on this company. The metaverse is not a silly sci-fi idea. Its going to be real very soon, it will accelerate faster than you can imagine, and it will replace reality as you know it. Im about to explain exactly where this is going in the near future and the distant future. This is going to sound very dystopian, which I agree with, but Im not in the stock market to be moral.

**The VR explosion:** Its already happening and its accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and its starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023.

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moores law to the computer chip. Its been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if its lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

Okay, enough about current data. Where is this really going? Im not sold on it, it seems kinda dumb.

**The crazy shit:** The metaverse is not the successor to the internet, its the successor to reality. Within the decade we will see the metaverse really take shape, then youll begin to see the vision of where this is going with your own eyes. But if you want a preview, Ill show you.

1. The metaverse will be an exponential self-sustaining economy that will surpass the GDP of the entire world. Blockchain is a really important part of this. Think of transactions in the metaverse for gaming, like CSGO skins. The skins are represented as NFTs. And are traded on the market. Your skins arent just for your game though. The metaverse is all connected, and you can take your CSGO skin and use it as an item in another game. You can take your genji skin and go to a concert. At the concert the person might sell T-shirts specific to that event which are also represented as NFTs. Businesses will begin to pop up in the metaverse. I already have several ideas, but will not be disclosing them here. Once people realize how easy it is to make money in the metaverse, much like the internet, there will be a mass migration. A gold rush like youve never seen. I could easily see another dot-com bubble level of excitement. The economy will rapidly grow. And as the metaverse becomes more and more real, it will only accelerate that growth. As more people join the metaverse, more major companies will need to change their business model to enter the metaverse in order to survive. Which will be a feedback loop that grows to unimaginable heights. If you want to get rich, be an early metaverse adopter and start a company that sells a service or product specifically useful for the metaverse. The real economy will transition more and more to the virtual and there will come a day before 2040 when the GDP of the metaverse surpasses that of the real world. And it wont stop there. Whoever runs the metaverse will have an economy larger than the entire world under their thumb.
2. What Meta wont tell you about the metaverse: By the time youve normalized living in the metaverse, you better not care about privacy anymore. I believe the idea of privacy will ultimately be discarded as the price of living. In your headset Meta will track your eye movements, your facial expressions, the way your body physically responds to the sensory input of the virtual world. Whether you like it or not, you are a predictable genetic algorithm. And when billions of data points about your response to input are measured, Meta will be able to build an artificial model of your expected output and know what you want before you want it. You might think, wow thats scary and really good for targeted advertising. And youd be right. But thats just the beginning.  

   1. Further future- 2030-2050: Once your being is analyzed as a data model (By an AI like a more powerful version of youtube recommended). At this point in time, AI has reached unprecedented capabilities. AI will build entire worlds for you, filled with things it knows you will enjoy, things youll want to buy, experiences youll want to have. A world far more interesting and exciting than the real one, tailored specifically to you.
   2. But your data will construct something even more bizarre. AI NPCs. Your best friends wont be homo sapiens. Theyll be AI indistinguishable from real people. Perhaps even alive themselves. Generated based on the data of your predictable personality model. Your true love. Someone literally perfect for you, will be an AI. And it will be incredible. You might think, *thats stupid this is stupid Im never going to fall in love with an AI*. You are wrong. And when youre there and the entity is in front of you in the virtual world. When you can touch them, and they can express emotion to you, you will understand. Your utopia is coming.
3. The metaverse will change what it means to be human. It will redefine our understanding of humanity and even gender. In the virtual world, there is no need to be a human. Your avatar can be an animal, a robot, an amoeba, an anime character, literally anything. People will soon feel better represented by your avatar than your real self. And as we cross that threshold the real world will seem more and more lack luster. The real world becomes a boring place where you have to live with this boring body that has to obey the laws of physics. This will further push the transition to the virtual world.
4. The transition from sedentary VR living to immortal consciousness. As people realize how incredible it is to live in the metaverse, the race for immortality will break out more powerfully than the space race. What is the race for immortality?

If theyve had billions of years to evolve, why dont we see signs of intelligent life in the universe? Why are we alone out here? Its not that intelligent life inherently drives itself to extinction.

1,"11/15/2021, 23:48:39",Roku's Little Brother $VZIO,misspiggy123,"TLDR: Buy VZIO leaps/shares. 

Some decent write-ups were done for VZIO a few months back. The market has continued to ignore the stock since then, but it's missing the ball on this growth story as the financials are somewhat clouded by their hardware sales/margins. Make no mistake, this is 100% a play on their platform model. 

Thesis -
Although it's possible that growth slows, absent a macro event (recession, etc), Vizio's ability to drive adoption through subsidized hardware sales (i.e. selling TVs at breakeven or even a loss) should allow them to succesfully eat into incumbents (Roku, Apple TV) market share. Black Friday and Christmas TV sales in 2021 will drive meaningful uptick in Platform + viewing hours in 2022, so I think both the sequential and YOY growth metrics will end up being conservative. The company has now had 3 quarterly reports as a public company, and has beaten Platform + revenue guidance 2 out of 2 times, indicating that demand continues to grow quicker than anticipated. A third beat in Q4 2021 and strong guidance for Q1/FY 2022 would cause a huge jump in the stock price (at least $30, but potentially $50+). Current Analyst PT are $29 for Piper Sandler and $30 for Needham. I think we start getting some PR over the next month and this closes 2021 around $30. Leaps are the play.

Look at the chart and realize that every major thing that made SPY crash VXX went heavy in leverage to push it down. Example being the GME incident back in January.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also noticed a increase in call options for VXX as buying PUTs on SPY have a cap to how much you can make but VXX calls on the other hand.....  Much more room for profit.  This has been happening for quite some time now (last 2 months has picked up a lot) and if you look at the day/year chart you can see volume ever so increasing.

1,"11/15/2021, 23:44:46",GOEV - The bang bus is back! #FuckShorts,officialbigrob,"First, credit to u/Forestur for the tipoff here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs0l9c/goev\_canoo\_earnings\_report\_speculation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs0l9c/goev_canoo_earnings_report_speculation/).  Without his initial work, this opportunity might have slipped right by.

**Who is Canoo / GOEV?**

[Canoo](https://www.canoo.com/) is an electric vehicle company designed around a subscription or lease model.  This is because their core technology is an EV drivetrain with interchangeable bodies.  [https://www.canoo.com/platform](https://www.canoo.com/platform)  This kind of business model is great for fleet vehicles and long term maintenance.  Businesses can order and return cars as needed, and canoo can refurbish or swap the body section to make the car ready for the next customer.  Critical motor or battery problem under warranty?  Swap the body to a new platform and roll back out with minimal downtime.  I have been bullish on Canoo since day 1 and FOMOd in hard as soon as I heard about the SPAC deal.  Its got a fucking window by your feet [so everyone can see your wifes hot legs while shes out with her boyfriend.](https://youtu.be/xnQXHMj3byc)

Unlike the cars you can buy today which need to be stripped for parts, the Canoo business model is going to completely change the way people think about a new or used car.  Did you know modern cars get totaled by hail?  What a piece of shit.  If you have a canoo your MPP is untouched and you just need your cabin swapped out.  If their business needs to move between providing pickups, passenger vans, delivery vans, and luxury sedans, [Canoo can do all of this easily.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqCaDBv4K-g) 

Look at how much effort it takes Ford or Tesla to create a new vehicle type, Canoo is going to turn this on its head.  This is the same kind of tech Rivian has, and Rivian has 50x the valuation.  [Rivian has only delivered maybe 75 trucks,](https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/) Canoo will deliver 1500 cars next year.

Speaking of car delivery, Canoo is working with [VDL,](https://www.vdlgroep.com/en/vdl-companies/car-assembly) who makes cars for people like BMW, to do their early phase manufacturing; and they just got Oklahoma to give them $300M in incentives to build out a factory. After the 1500 vehicles next year Canoo is slated for 20,000-25,000 vehicles in 2023, while building out the OK factory.  These guys are on track to be a major domestic player, but based on previous calls theyre very bullish on international markets since other countries are very serious about forcing a transition to EVs.  The reason Im heavily invested in EV tech is because the requirement to transition is global, not just exclusive to rich people in California.

Theyre also smart and flexible.  You know how new vehicle sales are lagging because semiconductors are hard to source?

&gt;\[We have\] consolidated our Electrical Architecture into a narrow set of controllers using fewer chips. Fewer parts overall mean we believe we are less exposed to global supply chain disruptions.

You should want to get in on this stock as an incredibly cheap play on great EV tech, just buy some shares and thank me later.  

**What is going on with this companys stock?**

As we know, the market is completely irrational, especially when it comes to EVs.  GOEV is not delivering cars until basically a year from now, so their value is still *highly* speculative, as a result, the value has been driven *more by shorts and hedgies* than by catalysts.

**The history of shorts**  
https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest

As soon as the DA was announced, people started shorting the stock. Fuck shorts, they hate the little guy.  From reading the nasdaq data and running my own crayon-level estimates, the shorts had the following positions open at the beginning of the year:

* 5.9M @ $16.25
* 2M @ $18
* 1.1M @ $11.25
* 1M @ $10.25

Since the beginning of the year the shorts have tripled down, with the following notable buying periods:

* 8M @ $12.40
* 12M @ $9
* 4.7M @ $10.4
* 1.7M @ $7.2

Given the available data on the number of closed positions, Ive estimated the open shorts at something like

* 6.2M @ $12.40
* 1.1M @ $11.25
* 5.8M @ $10.25
* 12M @ $9
* 0.9M @ $8
* 3M @ $7.25

**GOEV - Shorts run this town**

Lets look at the data we have on shorts for the last year and see how their behavior has affected the stock price.  I know we try not to say that correlation is causation, but when shorts move at least 800,000 shares, the share price responds, often by spiking up or down by $1.50-3, with the largest correlated move over $6, when shorts sold 8 million shares and the price tanked.

From March 15 thru June 30, shorts behavior is driving the share price: big sales drive the price down, and when a significant number of positions are closed the share price rebounds.  From July 30 thru Oct 29, any time shorts move 800k+ we see a direct correlation, while periods of limited short behavior continue a very slow trend down (lack of positive catalysts for the company, it makes sense).

Lets go over that key information again: increased volume of 800,000 - 8,000,000 shares through hedgie has regularly driven the share price with a correlated impact of $1.5-$6.6.  This stock price is *very sensitive to volume*.

**Whats going on this week?**

Two things are happening.  **First,** there will be an earnings report TONIGHT (Monday), and this could introduce a catalyst that drives the share price up or down.  Tony Tequila is gonna bring the good news and put us on the launchpad.  From the horses mouth: we will teach people not to short our stock.  **Second,** a lot of options are expiring this week, with between 900,000 and 6.3M shares expiring ITM between calls and puts.  Our win here involves the closing contracts creating pressure to buy shares, which drives the price up, putting more contracts ITM, and creating a feedback loop.  There are currently *over one million* shares due with ITM contracts, this is already a statistically significant volume.

https://preview.redd.it/resfe8xz3sz71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8789ee8546a34dbcdeb0004f51a2140da348fb04

**Whats going on with the shorts?**

Shorts are uncertain.  They put out over 2 million shares when the price was under $8, but also closed 4.6 million shorts in the same time frame.  When shorts closed their positions the stock *rocketed* up, it seems like they cant push it much harder, or arent hungry to.  Most of the shares are shorted between $9 and $13 which is making the shorts ITM and feeling bullish, but it seems like the stock has strong support for rebounds whenever the shorts let up on pressure.  We want the stock over $13, putting the hedgies underwater on their bets and turning the heat up.  If they panic and close, the stock pops.  We are still near ATH shorted amounts, but the stock has been running up.

**Are there other factors?**

Insiders hold over 50% of the company, and they are *not fucking selling*, which is an extremely positive sign.  ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/insider-activity))

**OK, OK, but what is the fucking play?**

**Shares and calls.**  No warrants.  Shares because we need to eat up the bid/ask and calls because I want a fucking lambo and dont have hedgie money to buy $50M in shares and do this on my own.  If we can get this to $10 it jumps, to $12.50 and it explodes.  Remember that every 800k shares is significant: At $9, 1.2M shares are due; at $10 its 3M, then theres a gap to $12.50 4.25M, and at $15 its 5.1M shares.  The shorts have been working super hard to keep this under $9/share.  **If we get over $9 keep buying** and it flips their leverage.  We have already climbed from $6.99 to $9 this month, we can push it back to $9 and then load up with .  Once we moon buy every dip to build support.

Best case scenario, its already inevitable and were at $25 by Friday.  Worse case scenario we need to drive 400k+ shares to give this bad boy a 50c boost.  Thats 4000 apes in for 100 shares each.  Worst case scenario the hedgies short another $100-200M in shares and we have to fucking buy through it but they dont have the balls because this company is about to moon.  You dont short Tony Tequila.

We will push all the shorts underwater.  Lets look at the estimates again:

Right now, about 4M shorts are underwater with shares shorted under $8.50.  If we get this to $10, that number goes to 16M shorts underwater.  At $11 its over 20M shorts, and above $12.50 over 25 million shorted shares will be upside down.  This is not an infinite squeeze, but its got a lot of potential to run.  

**Tl;dr -** Shorts want the bangbus to fail, we want the bangbus to .  Buy GOEV shares, ITM calls, ATM calls.  Good news tonight, we ride at dawn!

The cannabis market is an emerging market in the US. Multiple bills are making their way through Congress, both partisan and bipartisan bills emanating from the House and Senate. Banks, pharmaceutical companies, distributors and investor organisations are heavily lobbying Congress for this legalization. It has positive economic, public health and federal revenue impacts with little to no downside. If there ever was a time for legalizing cannabis in the US at the federal level, now is the time. This post evaluates the potential market, its growth potential and overall players (some which I am well invested in) in the market as well as consider other international markets where cannabis has already been legalized.

# Canadian Cannabis Market

Many here warn cannabis investors about the Canadian market and how things have turned out for Canadian weed stocks. That warning would be well considered, though, there are some key differences between the US and Canadian markets.

While cannabis has largely been legalized in Canada since 2018, the Canadian cannabis market is still relatively new with a large diversification of players that are only now seeing the beginning of the M&amp;A phase of the industry. Canada can be used as a rough template for legalization in the US but only to a degree of consumer adoption. Even then, consumer use of cannabis in Canada would be fractional compared to the US.

Canada has a different health care system which dampens the profit generation of their pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. Furthermore, Canadian cultural preservation regulations limit what can be imported and/or consumed by consumers. Additionally, the Canadian population is largely much happier than the average American. More days off per year, better labor regulation, universal healthcare and minimum standards of living all create a generally happier population. This happiness leads to smaller per capita consumption of alcohol in Canada relative to the US. While the population of Canada is about 10% of the United States, Canadian alcohol revenue is only 3% the size of the US market. Canadas alcohol market is 8.3 billion USD vs. US alcohol revenue at 249 billion as of 2021. As such, Canada cannot be viewed as a reasonable model for market size and revenue projection in the US when it comes to cannabis recreational use. Similarities exist when comparing most European nations that have legalized the recreational use of cannabis.

# US Market Size

As of 2017, [US is the leading consumer of cannabis](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/us-leads-the-world-in-cannabis-consumption-and-were-feeling-fine.html) in the world.  In addition to raw recreational use, other consideration in the US domestic use of cannabis resides in offsets for OTC pain mitigation as well as sleep aids. The author assumes that some portion of the legal US cannabis market will be used for OTC pain relief and sleep aids. Even at 1% of the pain relief market, that is 26 million in revenue with a CAGR of 3.7%. Likewise, 1% of the sleep aid market would be realized as a 300 million revenue per year with a CAGR of 4.8%.

Finally, like pain and sleep, it is expected that cannabis use will offset some of the alcohol market. Assuming this is around 1% of the alcohol market, that is around 2.5 billion additional revenue. When OTC medications and alcohol offsets are considered, the market of cannabis in the US would have a potential 3-4 billion boost through cannibalization of other markets. Thats a conservative estimate given the cost of cannabis is about $0.06 / mg whereas alcohol is roughly 10x that at the cheapest levels. If you account for this cost factor, after the reduction of social stigma associated with cannabis use, you could potentially see US cannabis eating up a larger percentage of the alcohol market. Presently the legal cannabis market in the US is at [17.5 billion 2020 according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/03/03/us-cannabis-sales-hit-record-175-billion-as-americans-consume-more-marijuana-than-ever-before/?sh=199e74fb2bcf). Recreational use in the US alone is [projected to reach $42 billion by 2026](https://www.statista.com/statistics/933384/legal-cannabis-sales-forecast-us/) without any form of federal legalization. Considering the above factors, the author predicts that if legalized in 2022 the total revenue from cannabis in the US could be two to three factors above current projections.

# US Players

A good breakdown of US players can be found here, ranked by annual revenue: [https://www.newcannabisventures.com/cannabis-company-revenue-ranking/](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/cannabis-company-revenue-ranking/)

NOTE: in the list above are some agricultural companies, like SMG, which are going to benefit from the cannabis industry indirectly, but since they have strong influence in that industry, they are considered players. This DD will start with the top ten players based on **adjusted operating income**. This is because any cannabis company operating in the US legally should have positive cash flow that would be set aside for growth and future M&amp;A activity. Of the players from above, sorted by this metric, we have (quarterly adj. op. income shown in **millions**):

1. Trulieve     $83.0
2. Green Thumb Industries   $58.1
3. Verano Holdings     $43.1
4. Innovative Industrial Properties   $36.3
5. Turning Point Brands     $17.1
6. Marimed      $12.0
7. Ascend Wellness     $11.6
8. TerrAscend      $11.3
9. Village Farms     $8.1
10. GrowGeneration    $4.7

Next, when we consider the above companies sorted by YoY growth, we have:

1. Verano Holdings   320%
2. Marimed    239%
3. Village Farms    212%
4. Ascend Wellness   128%
5. GrowGeneration   111%
6. Trulieve    78%
7. TerrAscend    72%
8. Innovative Industrial Properties 57%
9. Green Thumb Industries  49%
10. Turning Point Brands   17%

It should not be a surprise that the fastest growing companies have the least adjusted operating income, as they are spending most of their revenue on growth if they want to be a player during the M&amp;A phase of this market expansion.

Because of the explosive growth potential, we do not want to ignore QoQ growth as this is an indicator of momentum should federal legalization come within the next twelve months. Consider the same companies above, sorted by QoQ growth:

1. Verano Holdings    64%
2. Marimed     32%
3. Village Farms     26%
4. Ascend Wellness    13%
5. Trulieve     11%
6. TerrAscend     10%
7. Innovative Industrial Properties  10%
8. Green Thumb Industries   5%
9. GrowGeneration    -8%
10. Turning Point Brands    -11%

This puts the focus on three clear and potential growth winners: **Verano Holdings, Marimed and Village Farms**, in respective order for the largest potential gains in the market.

For safe plays, one could go with **Truelieve, Innovative Industrial Properties and Green Thumb** as these have the most favorable financial positions between cash and growth.

Other honorable mentions that are in the top 2 in at least two categories would be:

**Company**   \- **QoQ** \- **YoY** \- **Adj. Op. Income (millions)**

Schwazze             59%      467%     $4.4

Ayr Wellness        56%     222%     -$24.9

Gage Growth       50%     130%      -$5.8

Planet 13 Holdings   38%   205%     $-0.6

Columbia Care      19%     260%     -$8.2

4Front Ventures    18%     114%     $0.7

Jushi Holdings       14%     220%     -$4.2

It should be noted that most of the above honorable mentions exhibit negative adjusted operating income are expending most of their income on growth.

# Future Growth

With the US cannabis market currently at 17.5 billion and the latest conservative projections, without Federal legalization, putting the market at 42 billion by 2026 according to Statista based on analyst data from various think tanks, we can expect with federal legalization in the next 12 months to adjust that by a factor of at least two (accounting for stated where it is not legal along with increased interstate commerce and international trade). According to Arc Research via Forbes, the US is the single largest consumer of legal cannabis in the world ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomaspellechia/2018/03/01/double-digit-billions-puts-north-america-in-the-worldwide-cannabis-market-lead/?sh=351acb886510](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomaspellechia/2018/03/01/double-digit-billions-puts-north-america-in-the-worldwide-cannabis-market-lead/?sh=351acb886510)). This is a reinforcement of the standard of living and average happiness points made in the introduction and will drive the capitalistic markets of the cannabis trade in the US for at least the next decade. For US cannabis companies, there will be several that bubble to the top and will serve as winners for a long hold over the next several years.

# What About Canadian Cannabis Stocks

Some Canadian stocks see the future quite clearly and are making moves buying beverage companies and even buying store fronts and cannabis related companies in the US.  For example, [Tilray has been planning on US expansion by making acquisitions in the US](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cannabis-company-tilray-sets-blueprint-for-u-s-expansion-11634299200). Canopy Growth also has made similar plays.  Companies like these will certainly realize some benefit and growth when the US legalizes cannabis at the federal level.  If you are like me and holding Tilray and/or Canopy Growth, you might consider holding these. I plan to as I increase my stake in US based companies.  You might consider examination of other Canadian companies that have not made moves that consider US expansion.

# Disclaimer

I currently own at least 500 shares either directly or through calls that expire in Jan 22 of the stocks I mentioned above: Tilray, Canopy Growth, Trulieve, Green Thumb and plan to acquire the growth winners mentioned above and flesh out the safe bets.

Article:

* Polestar has delivered over 10,000 cars last year alone and plans to 300% this in 2022.
* It's valuation is around 5 times less that it's peers $RIVN and half the price of $LCID.
* Polestar was founded in 2017 by Volvo group and Greely.
* TopGear reviewed the polestar 2 in 2021 stating ""One of the most complete electric cars money can buy. Superb build quality, and decent to drive""

*""Its a deal of epic proportions with an enterprise value of $20 billion. It includes a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $250 million from top-tier institutional investors and could potentially provide the target business with $800 million in cash proceeds from Gores Guggenheim.""*

Polestar was founded by Volvo &amp; Greely in 2017, two leading car manufacturers with hundreds of years worth of experience, knowledge and funding. In 2020 alone Volvo sold 661,713 cars and currently sits on $9.3b in cash.

This means they already have the know how and funds to super charge their expansion and capture a market share.

In a recent interview the Chief executive of polestar said the following We don't need the capital to build the factory. We can put the money raised into developing the technology and the market. Where as most of the other EV companies mentioned above have no revenue, little existing infrastructure and are years behind getting off the ground.

Unlike most EV companies such as $LCID, $RIVN, $FSR etc Polestar has already delivered over 10,000 cars this year alone. Whilst forecasting to sell over 290,000 vehicles by 2025.

Its important to remember that producing a prototype of any product is the easy part, its mass production where most companies fail. Polestar has already proven their business model and has the backing of the two giants to make the company a success.

and

""Beautifully built intuitive cabin, effortless performance, exceptionally cool image, the look on Tesla drivers faces""

So let's take a look at the valuations of the most popular EV start ups:

**$RIVN** \- $103b valuation - 42 cars delivered (mainly to employees) - Expects to spend over $1b this quarter to make $1m in revenue.

**$FSR** \- $5.9b valuation - It expects to deliver 700 vehicles by 2023 (another 2 years). $0 revenue

**$LCID** \- $72b valuation - It expects to deliver 577 cars in 2021 with only 13,000 reservations. $76m revenue

**Polestar** \- $20b Valuation - Sold and DELIVERED over 10,000 cars in 2020 alone and expects to delivery 29,000 in 2020. $1.2b in revenue.

The comparison is ludicrous and it's my belief that once people realise just how far behind it's competitors are in bringing their product to the market a lot more attention and money will flow into Polestar.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/quhw1r/polestar_is_extremely_undervalued_years_ahead_of/

**History**

A little background

* Polestar  takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris  not the resourceful  co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. Thats *Polstjrnan* (literal translation, Pole Star) if youre Swedish.
* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvos partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.
* Volvo  acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by  Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands  Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4  million cars in 2020.
* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being independent since 2017.
* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.
* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.

**Comps**

**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**

* Applying  Teslas 2022E multiple (17.2x) to Polestar implies a share price of  $27.46. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase  of 156.64%.
* Applying  Lucids 2022E multiple (29.6x) to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.27. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase  of 342.78%.

**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**

* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.
* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:

1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).
2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.

* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.
* Polestar  is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship  with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment  opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.
* As  with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related  production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US  factories going forward.

**Upcoming Polestar lineup**

* Polestar  3 (2022)  luxury electric SUV built in the USA at Volvos South  Carolina factory. Polestar also hopes to have the South Carolina  vehicles be union-made no easy task these days (looking at you, Austin  Elon).
* Ingenlath  (CEO): ""Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American  customers. I remember the great response when I first shared Polestar's  vision here in the USA and I am proud that our first SUV will be  manufactured in South Carolina. From now on, the USA is no longer an  export market but a home market.""

**Political / Regulatory Tailwinds**

The US and global political environment has never been more positive for investment in electric vehicles.

On  Saturday morning, the House of Representatives voted 228-206 to pass  the Build Back Better infrastructure bill totaling $1.2 trillion. This  is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.

Relevant highlights:

* The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.
* Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.
* An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.

**Brand Rollout**

While watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series a couple weeks ago, I saw this TV commercial:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk)

* It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.
* Launched  ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot  narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human  advancement, the way we live now and the damage we're doing to the  planet.
* Nyberg: ""Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.

Your risk on GGPI... pre merger, it has a NAV (net asset value) floor of $10.

Well, we dont know a lot about Leos investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:

* \[CEO\]  Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake DiCaprio \[has\] in the  company. One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is  sustainability, Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. Its as well  very important for Leo. He and us being joined on that journey, him  investing in our company, obviously that makes sense for both sides.

**TL;DR**  $GGPI is taking Swedish EV auto maker Polestar public. The cars  are sexy AF, and match up well with the Tesla Model 3 on both  performance and price. Polestar has 29K cars on the road and $1.5B in  revenue in FY21, and still trades at a deep discount to other EV pure  plays.

1,"11/15/2021, 22:30:22","Gather Around Lil' Weedlings, It's Time for Some DD",Aramedlig,"# Introduction

The cannabis market is an emerging market in the US. Multiple bills are making their way through Congress, both partisan and bipartisan bills emanating from the House and Senate. Banks, pharmaceutical companies, distributors and investor organisations are heavily lobbying Congress for this legalization. It has positive economic, public health and federal revenue impacts with little to no downside. If there ever was a time for legalizing cannabis in the US at the federal level, now is the time. This post evaluates the potential market, its growth potential and overall players (some which I am well invested in) in the market as well as consider other international markets where cannabis has already been legalized.

# Canadian Cannabis Market

Many here warn cannabis investors about the Canadian market and how things have turned out for Canadian weed stocks. That warning would be well considered, though, there are some key differences between the US and Canadian markets.

While cannabis has largely been legalized in Canada since 2018, the Canadian cannabis market is still relatively new with a large diversification of players that are only now seeing the beginning of the M&amp;A phase of the industry. Canada can be used as a rough template for legalization in the US but only to a degree of consumer adoption. Even then, consumer use of cannabis in Canada would be fractional compared to the US.

Canada has a different health care system which dampens the profit generation of their pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. Furthermore, Canadian cultural preservation regulations limit what can be imported and/or consumed by consumers. Additionally, the Canadian population is largely much happier than the average American. More days off per year, better labor regulation, universal healthcare and minimum standards of living all create a generally happier population. This happiness leads to smaller per capita consumption of alcohol in Canada relative to the US. While the population of Canada is about 10% of the United States, Canadian alcohol revenue is only 3% the size of the US market. Canadas alcohol market is 8.3 billion USD vs. US alcohol revenue at 249 billion as of 2021. As such, Canada cannot be viewed as a reasonable model for market size and revenue projection in the US when it comes to cannabis recreational use. Similarities exist when comparing most European nations that have legalized the recreational use of cannabis.

# US Market Size

As of 2017, [US is the leading consumer of cannabis](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/us-leads-the-world-in-cannabis-consumption-and-were-feeling-fine.html) in the world.  In addition to raw recreational use, other consideration in the US domestic use of cannabis resides in offsets for OTC pain mitigation as well as sleep aids. The author assumes that some portion of the legal US cannabis market will be used for OTC pain relief and sleep aids. Even at 1% of the pain relief market, that is 26 million in revenue with a CAGR of 3.7%. Likewise, 1% of the sleep aid market would be realized as a 300 million revenue per year with a CAGR of 4.8%.

Finally, like pain and sleep, it is expected that cannabis use will offset some of the alcohol market. Assuming this is around 1% of the alcohol market, that is around 2.5 billion additional revenue. When OTC medications and alcohol offsets are considered, the market of cannabis in the US would have a potential 3-4 billion boost through cannibalization of other markets. Thats a conservative estimate given the cost of cannabis is about $0.06 / mg whereas alcohol is roughly 10x that at the cheapest levels. If you account for this cost factor, after the reduction of social stigma associated with cannabis use, you could potentially see US cannabis eating up a larger percentage of the alcohol market. Presently the legal cannabis market in the US is at [17.5 billion 2020 according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/03/03/us-cannabis-sales-hit-record-175-billion-as-americans-consume-more-marijuana-than-ever-before/?sh=199e74fb2bcf). Recreational use in the US alone is [projected to reach $42 billion by 2026](https://www.statista.com/statistics/933384/legal-cannabis-sales-forecast-us/) without any form of federal legalization. Considering the above factors, the author predicts that if legalized in 2022 the total revenue from cannabis in the US could be two to three factors above current projections.

# US Players

A good breakdown of US players can be found here, ranked by annual revenue: [https://www.newcannabisventures.com/cannabis-company-revenue-ranking/](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/cannabis-company-revenue-ranking/)

NOTE: in the list above are some agricultural companies, like SMG, which are going to benefit from the cannabis industry indirectly, but since they have strong influence in that industry, they are considered players. This DD will start with the top ten players based on **adjusted operating income**. This is because any cannabis company operating in the US legally should have positive cash flow that would be set aside for growth and future M&amp;A activity. Of the players from above, sorted by this metric, we have (quarterly adj. op. income shown in **millions**):

1. Trulieve   OTC: TCNNF  $83.0 
2. Green Thumb Industries  OTC: GTBIF  $58.1 
3. Verano Holdings   OTC: VRNOF  $43.1 
4. Innovative Industrial Properties NYSE: IIPR  $36.3 
5. Turning Point Brands   NYSE: TPB  $17.1 
6. Marimed    OTC: MRMD  $12.0 
7. Ascend Wellness   OTC: AAWH  $11.6 
8. TerrAscend    OTC: TRSSF  $11.3 
9. Village Farms    NASDAQ: VFF $8.1 
10. GrowGeneration   NASDAQ: GRWG $4.7 

Next, when we consider the above companies sorted by YoY growth, we have:

1. Verano Holdings   320% 
2. Marimed    239% 
3. Village Farms    212% 
4. Ascend Wellness   128% 
5. GrowGeneration   111% 
6. Trulieve    78% 
7. TerrAscend    72%
8. Innovative Industrial Properties 57%
9. Green Thumb Industries  49% 
10. Turning Point Brands   17%

It should not be a surprise that the fastest growing companies have the least adjusted operating income, as they are spending most of their revenue on growth if they want to be a player during the M&amp;A phase of this market expansion.

Because of the explosive growth potential, we do not want to ignore QoQ growth as this is an indicator of momentum should federal legalization come within the next twelve months. Consider the same companies above, sorted by QoQ growth:

1. Verano Holdings    64% 
2. Marimed     32% 
3. Village Farms     26% 
4. Ascend Wellness    13% 
5. Trulieve     11% 
6. TerrAscend     10% 
7. Innovative Industrial Properties  10% 
8. Green Thumb Industries   5% 
9. GrowGeneration    -8% 
10. Turning Point Brands    -11% 

This puts the focus on three clear and potential growth winners: **Verano Holdings, Marimed and Village Farms**, in respective order for the largest potential gains in the market.

For safe plays, one could go with **Truelieve, Innovative Industrial Properties and Green Thumb** as these have the most favorable financial positions between cash and growth.

Other honorable mentions that are in the top 2 in at least two categories would be:

**Company**  **Ticker**   **QoQ** **YoY** **Adj. Op. Income (millions)**

Schwazze  OTC: SHWZ  59% 467% $4.4

Ayr Wellness  OTC: AYRWF  56% 222% -$24.9 

Gage Growth  OTC: GAEGF  50% 130% -$5.8 

Planet 13 Holdings OTC: PLNHF  38% 205% $-0.6 

Columbia Care OTC: CCHWF  19% 260% -$8.2 

4Front Ventures OTC: FFNTF  18% 114% $0.7 

Jushi Holdings OTC: JUSHF  14% 220% -$4.2

It should be noted that most of the above honorable mentions exhibit negative adjusted operating income are expending most of their income on growth.

# Future Growth

With the US cannabis market currently at 17.5 billion and the latest conservative projections, without Federal legalization, putting the market at 42 billion by 2026 according to Statista based on analyst data from various think tanks, we can expect with federal legalization in the next 12 months to adjust that by a factor of at least two (accounting for stated where it is not legal along with increased interstate commerce and international trade). According to Arc Research via Forbes, the US is the single largest consumer of legal cannabis in the world ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomaspellechia/2018/03/01/double-digit-billions-puts-north-america-in-the-worldwide-cannabis-market-lead/?sh=351acb886510](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomaspellechia/2018/03/01/double-digit-billions-puts-north-america-in-the-worldwide-cannabis-market-lead/?sh=351acb886510)). This is a reinforcement of the standard of living and average happiness points made in the introduction and will drive the capitalistic markets of the cannabis trade in the US for at least the next decade. For US cannabis companies, there will be several that bubble to the top and will serve as winners for a long hold over the next several years.

# What About Canadian Cannabis Stocks

Some Canadian stocks see the future quite clearly and are making moves buying beverage companies and even buying store fronts and cannabis related companies in the US.  For example, [Tilray has been planning on US expansion by making acquisitions in the US](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cannabis-company-tilray-sets-blueprint-for-u-s-expansion-11634299200). Canopy Growth also has made similar plays.  Companies like these will certainly realize some benefit and growth when the US legalizes cannabis at the federal level.  If you are like me and holding TLRY, CGC, you might consider holding these. I plan to as I increase my stake in US based companies.  You might consider examination of other Canadian companies that have not made moves that consider US expansion.

# Disclaimer

I currently own at least 500 shares either directly or through calls that expire in Jan 22 of the stocks I mentioned above: TLRY, CGC, TCNNF, GTBIFF and plan to acquire the growth winners mentioned above and flesh out the safe bets.

The market continues to levitate with no real reasoning behind it other than big funds looking at pretty charts and performance chasing thru the end of the year. Will this be enough to continue to hold the markets up? Let's take it a day at a time and find out. The weekly chart has still not quite reached the condition of overbought. The daily chart momentum has kind of leveled out almost negative flat angle which gives credence to weekly chart having to cycle before we get out of the range. The range is 470 area down to 460 area. Be prepared to see smaller bullish candles strung together then follow by long bearish drops, all still mostly inside this same range. Today 468 area will be pivotal. Above 468 area we may fight for a new all-time high below 468 we remain range bound, with high probability of testing the low end of the range soon.

Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 15th, 2021-

# [Dow futures up 100 points after market breaks a 5-week winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were slightly higher in early morning trading on Monday as investors prepared to start the week after the S&amp;P 500 broke a five-week winning streak.
*****
&gt; Dow futures gained 137 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each up about 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares fell 2% premarket Monday following a weekend Twitter exchange between founder Elon Musk and Sen. Bernie Sanders.
*****
&gt; We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period, the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats wrote.
*****
&gt; I keep forgetting that youre still alive, Musk responded. In a follow-up tweet, he said, Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word 
*****
&gt; Dow component ExxonMobil saw its shares under pressure, falling nearly 1% premarket as West Texas Intermediate oil futures slipped more than 1% to fall just under $80 a barrel.
*****
&gt; Also on the bluechip index, Boeing rose nearly 3% following news that Saudi Arabian Airlines is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a wide-body jet order. At the same time, Emirates announced an order for two Boeing 777 Freighters at the 2021 Dubai Airshow.
*****
&gt; Dollar Tree shares gained 7% premarket following a report Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has taken a stake worth at least $1.8 billion in the discount store chain and will push it to do more to add to shareholder value.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a losing week after last months consumer price index made its largest annual increase in more than three decades. The major averages snapped a five-week winning streak.
*****
&gt; Markets digested a range of economic news last week showing that inflation was rising even more than expected and workers continued to quit their jobs in search of better opportunities.
*****
&gt; That data added to concerns that inflation at a 30-year high could indeed remain a stickier problem and challenge for businesses, consumers and monetary policy makers to contend with over the next four to six months or even longer John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said in a note Monday. He said he expects inflation to dampen, however.
*****
&gt; Positive offsets to the current waves of inflation hitting the U.S. economy at this time are likely to emerge as the effects of what may have been overstimulation of the economy at the height of the pandemic fade, he said.
*****
&gt; Investors this week will get a look at how much consumers are spending when retail sales data drops Tuesday, while housing numbers come Wednesday with new construction starts and building permits. This also will be a busy week for the Federal Reserve, with multiple officials scheduled to speak through the week.
*****
&gt; Also, the Labor Department reported that a record 4.4 million workers left their jobs in September, generally that they can get something better. Consumer confidence, though, dipped to a 10-year low in November, as consumers apparently flush with cash are growing more worried about inflation.
*****
&gt; Octobers CPI jumped 6.2% from a year ago, well above the 5.9% estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones. The index, which tracks a basket of consumer products, increased 0.9% on a month-over-month basis, also hotter than expected.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.6% and the S&amp;P 500 eased 0.3% last week. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was the main underperformer, dropping 0.7% as rising bond yields dented growth pockets of the market.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected to combat inflation.
*****
&gt; Also denting sentiment was a report that workers left their jobs in record numbers in September, with 4.43 million people quitting, the Labor Department reported Friday. The exodus occurred as the U.S. had 10.44 million employment openings that month, according to the report.
*****
&gt; Still, the major averages are not far from their record highs. The Dow is 1.3% off its all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq sit 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, away from their records.
*****
&gt; Investors will be focused on Tuesdays retail sales report and several major retailers earnings this week. Walmart and Home Depot release results on Tuesday, and Target and Lowes report on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; On Monday, President Joe Biden will host a bipartisan bill signing ceremony for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Basically, we all have a shitload of stock in several companies, I want to elect us as board members to these companies. I'm an Australian citizen, not working in the US, so I can't be a board member, which is why I want to throw it out to you guys until I can eventually join the board of Afterpay or Westfarmers lol. 

I am not choosing who is going to be the board member yet: I need to work out a process and a company first. I've got an anonymous survey below, and I just want to find out how much stock WSB owns in what company. I won't immediately publish the results so that nobody can do any funky for guessing the company and pumping-and-dumping the stock price like I know you degenerates will. Just let us know what you've got, so that way we can select something juicy and not a shit-stock that nobody has anything in. Here's the link:

The company was one of the frontrunners in the race to bring a Covid vaccine to market, but that was eons ago in stock market terms with the stock only trending in one direction (down) since mid-2020s improbable peaks.

Inovio has struggled to get its Covid-19 DNA vaccine INO-4800 beyond the mid-stage of testing (at least in the US), and in fact, for the past 14 months the FDA had put the brakes on its development as the regulatory body wanted to gather more info on the vaccine and the proprietary delivery device via which it is administered.

However, after a long review period, the FDA has finally given its blessing for the Phase 3 study to commence, making the US the 7th country to approve the late-stage trial.

But with various vaccines available and the pandemic already on the backfoot domestically, is it too late to make a meaningful impact? Not according to Oppenheimers Hartaj Singh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/quegx9/inovio_stock_at_35_a_share_this_analyst_thinks/

1,"11/15/2021, 18:27:54","FDA Gives Inovio Green Light for Phase 3 Trial of DNA COVID-19 Vaccine ~ November 11, 2021 ",WallStBull10Point0,"Inovio has received the FDA go-ahead for a phase 3 trial of INO-4800, a DNA plasmid vaccine against COVID-19.

The agency lifted a prior clinical hold on the study after Inovio satisfied questions about the vaccine and its needleless electroporation delivery system, Inovios Joseph Kim said on an investor webcast.

Inovio and partner Advaccine Biopharmaceuticals Suzhou Co. (China) will conduct the INNOVATE study in Mexico, Brazil, Columbia and Thailand, in addition to the U.S. The trial will evaluate INO-4800 in healthy adults aged 18 years and older, who will get two 2-mg doses given one month apart. The primary endpoint is virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19.

We are aiming to have the interim phase 3 data available by the first half of 2022, after which Inovio will apply for an Emergency Use Authorization, Kim said.

This is the first large-scale test of a DNA plasmid vaccine for COVID-19.  DNA vaccines have some unique advantages over mRNA vaccines, including a relative insensitivity to temperature. The vaccines have shown 1-year stability at temperatures of up to 98.6 degrees and have a projected 5-year shelf life at normal refrigeration temperatures.

The companys proprietary delivery device is a key component of the vaccine system. The hand-held unit, powered by AA batteries, uses air pressure to force the vaccine into the epidermis. It then generates millisecond-duration electrical pulses that temporarily open pores in all cells lying within the electrical field, including immune cells. This allows the plasmid ring, encoded with the viral antigen, to enter easily. Electroporation increases the amount of DNA delivery by more than 1,000-fold compared to traditional injection delivery, the company said.

After uptake, immune cells use the plasmid DNA sequence to generate antigens; this stimulates an immediate immune response as well as the long-lasting humeral immune memory vaccines rely on. DNA vaccines do not interfere with or change in any way an individuals own DNA, the company added.

The CELLECTRA 3PSP device is designed specifically for a COVID-19 type pandemic scenario, the company said in a press statement. The user-friendly design allows for stockpiling of the device in quantity without maintenance  [It] has been designed with reliability, challenging environments, user needs and ease of large-scale manufacturing in mind.

Development of this device really took off in 2019, with an $8.1 million investment from the medical arm of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agencys Medical Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense Consortium.

The lifting of FDAs clinical hold is another in a series of green lights flashing for Inovio, Kim said on the webcast.

The World Health Organization shared on Oct. 26 that our candidate is one of two that will be trialed internationally in the Solidarity Vaccines study. We believe INO-4800 is well-positioned to combat this global pandemic.  Michele G.

## Summary

* Gores Guggenheim is due to merge with Polestar next year.
* Polestar has delivered over 10,000 cars last year alone and plans to 300% this in 2022.
* It's valuation is around 5 times less that it's peers $RIVN and half the price of $LCID.
* Polestar was founded in 2017 by Volvo group and Greely.
* TopGear reviewed the polestar 2 in 2021 stating ""One of the most complete electric cars money can buy. Superb build quality, and decent to drive""

On September 27th 2021 Polestar struck a deal with $GGPI to merge and bring the company public.

*""Its a deal of epic proportions with an enterprise value of $20 billion. It includes a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $250 million from top-tier institutional investors and could potentially provide the target business with $800 million in cash proceeds from Gores Guggenheim.""*

Polestar was founded by Volvo &amp; Greely in 2017, two leading car manufacturers with hundreds of years worth of experience, knowledge and funding. In 2020 alone Volvo sold 661,713 cars and currently sits on $9.3b in cash.

This means they already have the know how and funds to super charge their expansion and capture a market share.

In a recent interview the Chief executive of polestar said the following We don't need the capital to build the factory. We can put the money raised into developing the technology and the market. Where as most of the other EV companies mentioned above have no revenue, little existing infrastructure and are years behind getting off the ground.

Unlike most EV companies such as $LCID, $RIVN, $FSR etc Polestar has already delivered over 10,000 cars this year alone. Whilst forecasting to sell over 290,000 vehicles by 2025.

Its important to remember that producing a prototype of any product is the easy part, its mass production where most companies fail. Polestar has already proven their business model and has the backing of the two giants to make the company a success.

A review in 2021 by BBC's famous TopGear it was stated ""One of the most complete electric cars money can buy. Superb build quality, and decent to drive""

and

""Beautifully built intuitive cabin, effortless performance, exceptionally cool image, the look on Tesla drivers faces""

So let's take a look at the valuations of the most popular EV start ups:

**$RIVN** \- $103b valuation - 42 cars delivered (mainly to employees) - Expects to spend over $1b this quarter to make $1m in revenue.

**$FSR** \- $5.9b valuation - It expects to deliver 700 vehicles by 2023 (another 2 years). $0 revenue

**$LCID** \- $72b valuation - It expects to deliver 577 cars in 2021 with only 13,000 reservations. $76m revenue

**$GGPI** (Polestar) - $20b Valuation - Sold and DELIVERED over 10,000 cars in 2020 alone and expects to delivery 29,000 in 2020. $1.2b in revenue.

The comparison is ludicrous and it's my belief that once people realise just how far behind it's competitors are in bringing their product to the market a lot more attention and money will flow into Polestar.

1,"11/15/2021, 16:41:17",Supply Chain Crisis Tendies,NoTennis9571,"Global supply chains are a little fucky wucky at the moment.

Shipping is stuck in gluts around the world (e.g. LA) and U.K. had a 2 week fuel crisis like it was the 70s. Admittedly for different causes but many places seem to be struggling to smooth out global supply chains.

Do we think this will iron out on its own or will there be an investment play?

My ideas thus far are:
-civil contactors who expand port facilities
-global shipping companies passing on costs (Maersk)
-shipbuilding companies to accommodate demand increase (South Korean firms dominate this market)
-Freight rail companies
-Truck builders (Scania)

Any more ideas/advice would be appreciated",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qubyi0/supply_chain_crisis_tendies/

Go check out how many stores already have self-order terminals, they have already been operating with reduced staffing needs.

I wont bet against Tesla , but Im willing to bet against every other EV company that thinks it can just follow production projections . It simply is not sustainable where a company that assuming we can meet numbers , which is a big if is valued way over the traditional auto makers , and even they hit every single number theyve given out , they deliver 257 vehicles this year , at guess what , a 127
MILLION dollar loss this quarter . Add on top of that that inflation numbers ,supply chain shortages , and semi shortages . People are pumping EV stocks with no revenue behind it ? Welcome to my Ted talk but I think with all the run up this stock has had I think the market realizes to stop pumping money into non-profit companies . The real catalyst is if their earnings dictates they cant deliver the cars they promised ( side note , Tesla did that for 5 straight years , driving the stock price down ) . EV can run the world in 2030 , right now ? These market caps are ridiculous , LUCID is worth about 15 a share PRICING IN outlooks .

So for a long time, I've always seen driving through multiple greens on the way home to be a sign of good luck. I haven't seen many multi-greens in my life, but when I have I always see them on the way home, on all lights on the last road that has them, preceding the return home.

It's happened thrice before my winning a Salesmanship competition at a cattle show in 2012. It happened three times before I made it into All State Choir in 2015. It happened four times before I won a small (but important to me) HS class award in 2016. Now, it's happening again.

I have invested into AMC and GME and have been waiting for MOAS to happen so I can get rid of my old junker car and finally obtain a Tesla, and last week have begun seeing more multi-greens again. There were two on approaches last week and another a few days ago. Today, as I was coming back home again there was another, and as I was going to pick up my room-mate from dropping of his Model 3 for a tire appointment, one Multi-Green leaving, and another coming home.

So for a long time, I've always seen driving through multiple greens on the way home to be a sign of good luck. I haven't seen many multi-greens in my life, but when I have I always see them on the way home, on all lights on the last road that has them, preceding the return home. 

It's happened thrice before my winning a Salesmanship competition at a cattle show in 2012. It happened three times before I made it into All State Choir in 2015. It happened four times before I won a small (but important to me) HS class award in 2016. Now, it's happening again.

I have invested into AMC and GME and have been waiting for MOAS to happen so I can get rid of my old junker car and finally obtain a Tesla, and last week have begun seeing more multi-greens again. There were two on approaches last week and another a few days ago. Today, as I was coming back home again there was another, and as I was going to pick up my room-mate from dropping of his Model 3 for a tire appointment, one Multi-Green leaving, and another coming home.

I take this to be a sign that MOASS is rapidly approaching, and declare that the ape nation shall reign supreme soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qu8x7q/moass_traffic_light_dd/

**EXHIBIT A**
First of all, I'd like to present Exhibit A.
https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qtqzun/it_only_takes_one_card_to_take_down_the_house/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
**EXHIBIT A1**
Once you've finished reading that, I'd like to present Exhibit A1. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qty4mt/the_mcdonalds_strike_is_on_do_not_shop_or_apply/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share 

As we here all know, once Reddit sets their mind on something *that shit happens.* If the idea catches on, McDonald's is gonna be FUCKED for a while. If the idea catches on and Antiwork gets what they wish for out of this (other companies being forced to follow McDonald's) puts elsewhere might also fuckin PRINT. 

But let's take a look ELSEWHERE for online sentiment on McDonald's. 
**Exhibit B:**
https://subredditstats.com/r/Mcdonalds 
https://subredditstats.com/r/Cooking
As you can see here, the Cooking subreddit gets a little over 46x the amount of posts per day as the McDonald's subreddit. This is extremely bearish as it probably means more people are interested in cooking than they are interested in McDonald's food. I'd also like to add, the vegetarian subreddit gets 5x the amount of posts as the McDonald's sub, and the vegan subreddit gets 23x the amount of posts as McDonald's. 

Speaking of the McDonald's subreddit... 

**Exhibit C**
https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share 

These guys all hate their lives. Also I have a friend who's getting his entire store to quit, for funzies.

- ACB up ~13% 
- SNDL up ~ 28%
- TLRY up ~ 9%

Call option volume also heavily outweighed put volume. SNDL call volume was 92% vs 8% put volume. 

Technicals are also looking for positive for some of these stocks. Notably I saw ACB breaking out on the monthly and daily in a bollinger band squeeze to the upside. That and the 10MA moving up and over the 20MA signals possible further movement up. 

Weed is back in the news as well with rumors over the weekend of a Republican bill proposition dropping Monday. This is the catalyst for next week if indeed it happens. 

Lets see who can get higher next week, me or the stonks?

Synthetic leather chair while my clothes glued to my skin. My gaze was fixed on the monitor, barely visible by the blazing light of the sun, ricocheting throughout the room. The chirping of the birds filled the silence of the room as I was patiently waiting for the perfect moment. My heart pulsated like a drum against my chest as I recognized it continued getting closer and closer. 
Click my sweaty fingers had thumped on the button without hesitation or regret. I had entered into my first trade. 
    My quest to discover new passions had lead me to the stock market. This concept of buying and selling shares of companies made me in awe. I dedicated hours to research and observing others to manifest the unique skills of trading. As I acquired more knowledge the further my curiosity grew like an endless pit. Knowledge however was not enough to achieve mastery of trading. In order to obtain mastery, I had to gain experience. The search for experience lead me to the path of my first trade. 
    As I elevated the index finger off the right button, it had begun. The purchase of a hundred and one shares got placed instantaneously. The trade would barely last for thirty minutes though it had felt as if time slowed down. The booming of my heart become more furious and incessant. It was as if my heart was to burst at any instant. My eyes became fixated on the live price chart of the stock going up and down while racing thoughts of all outcome possibilities flood in like a Tsunami, overwhelming me. I had never felt such a concentrated amount of stress, overthrowing the discomfort felt by the heat.  A few minutes later after the price had consolidated at the same level, it began to advance. The sight of my profits tallying up caused me to leap from my chair full of roaring excitement. My eyes were in disbelief of a small victory I had accomplished. However, overconfidence possessed me and blinded me from the cruel reality. Even with the profit which I had gotten, I craved more. This greed ultimately was the downfall of this trade. The price began to dwindle down to where I had originally started. My thoughts went from satisfaction to anger. Unable to endure greater loss I existed my position which included a diminutive loss. My heart had relaxed as a lifting breeze swept in through the open window to cool me down. I sat there in utter silence, soaking in what I had experienced. I had lost.
I had befallen victim to my emotions. Overconfidence and greed deceived me from pursuing my methods. This would be of the many obstacles which I would have to overcome in order to mature as a trader. Losing was the first step to winning. 
    I have since learned countless new things which help me predict price movements and understand how companies function. The repetition of trading every day benefited me to control my emotion. It gives me the ability to stay calm without allowing the fear of missing out to overwhelm me. I have made hundreds of trades in the past few months and every time I learn something new. My hunger for success is what drives me to repeat it again and again. 
    Trading has become more than a passion but a pillar to what knowledge I want to obtain.  I have chosen to major in business for the sole objective of expanding my knowledge for a topic I admire most.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qu7yzz/can_anyone_give_thoughts_on_my_collage_essay_its/

In short, Elon just solved the volume problem for the cannabis industry.

This is on top of an already favorable near-term news cycle regarding cannabis legislation in the US (and Germany), with a conservative house member (Nancy Mace) hosting a public announcement in DC tomorrow (11/15) about the republicans proposal for cannabis legalization, which seems to be much, much more favorable to the industry than the democrats version, given Nancys proposal would incorporate a 3.75% tax, as opposed to Schumers ridiculous 25% tax. Will it pass, probably not, however the ultimate pumper just gave his approval, which even more importantly beyond moving markets, will move public attention, which might pressure congress to finally act, especially with so much debt being accrued and no clean way to pay it off.

So, tickers?

Until legalization happens and OTC tickers can join larger exchanges, I personally dont plan to partake in them given their trouble with volume off the big exchanges, so unfortunately this keeps most of the admittedly attractive MSO companies out of my portfolio in large amounts. Maybe this will change, but for now I just keep adding to a small position in the MSO ETF to have some US specific exposure.

Also, Im a cynic, so I believe the big companies will more sooner than later leverage their size and global influence to sweep up smaller guys, profitability be damned. So, my top picks are the companies best positioned to use their size and prearranged trigger deals upon US legalization to their advantage. This is primarily Tilray (TLRY) and Canopy Growth (CGC). Now, I know, SNDL is a favorite here, and they just killed it in Q2, plus they are soon beginning a commons buyback program, but, they pump and dump even worse than the others, and frankly smart money has been selling SNDL, whereas institutional money has been doubling or more of their stake in TLRY and CGC over the past 3 quarters, so Im following the money.

Power shortages and real estate crisis (Evergrande)??,Torture2580,"The Chinese economy has recently lost its sparkle, dragged down by electricity shortages and a massive real estate crisis, to the point where experts are beginning to question its impact on the global growth it has aided for more than two decades. **The difficulties of the real estate sector in China triggered by the troubles of giant Evergrande could pose risks for the world economy and affect the United States**, the Federal Reserve warned in its report on financial stability released Monday.

That is a marked change of tone from September when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell still believed the worlds largest economy was not really directly exposed to difficulties in China. Evergrande, estimated to be worth some 260 billion euros, is one of the biggest companies in China. Its financial situation is closely scrutinized because its collapse would deal a serious blow to the growth of the Asian giant.

**The real estate sector is estimated to account for 25-30 percent of Chinas GDP. In the third quarter, gross domestic product, suffering drag from the Evergrande crisis, grew by 4.9 percent year-on-year, down from 7.9 percent in the second quarter.** ""So far, the likes of the Evergrande debacle has been contained by Chinese official sector buffering,"" said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research for the Americas at financial institution ING. But he admitted there were ""unknown risks."" And he said the Fed cannot ignore the fact that ""China is right up there as a factor given its size, and the size of its financial sector.""

In October, the International Monetary Fund revised downwards its expansion forecasts for China, counting on eight percent, or down 0.1 percent. Its chief economist Gita Gopinath stressed that the institution is ""paying very close attention"" to developments in the Evergrande crisis.

""**Our view is that the \[Chinese\] government has the resources and the ability to ring-fence the problem, which means that while we will see a shakeup happening in the real estate sector, that it will be contained and will not spill over more broadly**"" to Chinas economy, Gopinath told CBS news. The IMF expects global GDP to rise 5.9 percent this year against six percent in July. Beyond the real estate crisis, a slowdown in the worlds second-largest economy had been anticipated by many economists as the Chinese government, which is anxious to reduce debt, slows down investments by local authorities and tightens conditions for bank loans.

I feel the timing is right for another post with all the new and updated data we just received from Q3 earnings last week.

I'm not going to provide much commentary, rather I'm just going to drop some facts and data below and would love to hear your feedback once you've had a chance to read through it:

So let's get started...

&amp;#x200B;

$CLOV Q3 earnings beat consensus estimate with a 74% positive surprise:

https://preview.redd.it/su35z0c0wnz71.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff67fb41b814e90c6b6d2325a8d7c3f1583ccaad

$CLOV beat Q3 revenue estimate of $418M with an actual haul of $427M which was an increase of 153% YoY.

Let me repeat that- 153% Revenue growth YoY.

Q1 Rev: $200M

Q2 Rev: $412M

Q3 Rev: $427M

&amp;#x200B;

Their EPS was it's best since going public in Jan of this year and is trending in the right direction:

Q1 EPS: ($0.13)

Q2 EPS: ($0.78)

Q3 EPS: ($0.08)

Probably the most important metric to look at w/ $CLOV is their Medical Care Ratio which is claims costs divided by revenues collected from premium. Essentially are they receiving more revenue from premium than they are paying out in claims.

For context, pre-Covid, their Medical Care Ratio... (sorry I have to keep typing out the full term, if I use its acronym, my post will get blocked because the acronym is a banned ticker on WSB... anyway, carry on) 

...Medical Care Ratio was in the 85-95% where $CLOV's profit margins were between 5-15%. However, going public amid the worst world pandemic in over 100 years has an effect on a technology/healthcare growth company- go figure.

Medical Care Ratio surged to 107% Q1 of '21, then 111% in Q2 coming out of 2020-21 winter high-water mark of Covid cases, but then retreated over 850 basis points in Q3 signaling a reversal as the effects from Covid are beginning to subside and pass into the rearview mirror.

Q3 Medical Care Ratio was 102% and it is expected to dip back into the normal zone in the mid-80 to mid-90s within the next couple of quarters. Get in now before they announce a sub-100% Medical Care Ratio announcement as this is what will likely make $CLOV moon.

Large institutional purchases (millions of shares) were made by the big boys just during Q3:

Vanguard- 7.4M+

PNC- 6.6M

Blackrock- 1.3M

Geode Capital Mgmt- 750K+

Goldman Sachs 700K+

Morgan Stanley 700K+

...and many more adding in the hundreds of thousands.

&amp;#x200B;

**LOOKING TO 2022**

Q3 earnings was a pivot point for $CLOV.  There has been a lot of noise out there, especially on the negative side of things, however, actual data is starting to reveal a clearer picture moving forward.   
 Earnings in Q3 were great, but it's Q4 and Q1 which will be the big exclamation marks (especially Q1 of 2022)

For those not familiar with the Medicare system, the government rates each company's offering with a Star Rating graded between 1-5 stars and updates it each year just before the Annual Enrollment Period. 

These stars dictate how much each company is reimbursed/paid by the government. Here is a chart showing this in more detail:

https://preview.redd.it/7vmyu0q2wnz71.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da7ce6f9c3786044b3df26360524ec42d7dfce19

Clover Health's plans were just upgraded from 3 to 3.5 stars for 2022, meaning that even if there was no growth at all in 2022, $CLOV will grow its revenue because they will be receiving a 30% bump in rebate payments (from 50%-65% as per the chart above). This will bring in more premium/revenue and improve the all important Medical Care Ratio metric I discussed above.

Another huge development for 2022 that we saw a glimpse of the second half of 2021 is Direct Contracting members.

Clover Health has 2 distinct groups of members/customers-

1. Medicare Advantage
2. Direct Contracting entities (DCE).

The DCE addition to $CLOV's customer pool are new to the company as of Q2. This is the reason $CLOV has seen massive YoY revenue increases beginning in Q2.

Currently, $CLOV has roughly 66K Medicare Adv members and about 62K DCE members for a total of just under 130K total members.

Clover Health actually makes more money from premium of a DCE member (earned roughly 19% more per member in Q3 than it did for an equivalent Medicare Adv. member ($3,602/qtr for DCE vs. $3,027 for MA). These customers also seem be be ""healthier"" as it was only (2.4%) in the red during Q3 for DCE vs (12.0%) for MA.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm going into so much detail in these Direct Contracting members is because after market close this past Friday, Clover Health just had a press release saying they will be doubling their DCE membership for 2022, which was just finalized by CMS.

This means that for 2022, $CLOV will have in the ballpark of 82-85K Medicare Advantage lives under management (member/customers) and in the ballpark of 125K Direct Contracting members for a total of 205-215K total.

Based on Q3 premium ratios it is pretty straightforward to calculate what their revenue will be for their Q1 2022 earnings.

MA low end - 82,000 x 3027= $248.21MM

MA High end - 85,000 x 3027= $257.3MM

What isn't as easy is how to calculate the 30% Start Rating Medicare Rebate bump into this. I don't think it's a straight 30% lift to the premium dollars collected, but it might be. I would assume on the low end, it's going to increase MA rev 10% and on the high end 30% so in short here are the MA ranges:

MA Low w/ rebate payment bump - $273 to $322.7MM

MA High est. w/ rebate payment bump - $283 to $334.5MM

DCE '22 rev based on 125K total members - $450.25MM

&amp;#x200B;

Now combine those together for their total Q1 2022 Revenue number and you have these ranges below:

$723MM - $785MM during the quarter.

For perspective, Q1 of 2021 barely saw $200MM in total revenue. Meaning $CLOV will see a 262% to 293% YoY revenue growth by Q2 2022. And honestly, Clover has shown a pattern of forecasting conservatively so this may even be lower that the actual results.

Let that sink in- 262%- 293% YoY rev growth for a technology first (Clover Assistant machine learning/AI software driven) healthcare company. Current market cap is between $2-3B and they may see $3-3.5B revenue during 2022 fiscal alone- undervalued?  You decide for yourself.

...Also of note, as of Jan 1, 2022, Clover will double their current geographical footprint.  Here is an excerpt from their PR: 

## Clover Plans Expansion into 101 New Markets

*June 24, 2021*

### Expansion nearly doubles companys geographic footprint based on number of counties

### NASHVILLE, Tenn., June 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Clover Health (NASDAQ: CLOV) (Clover), an innovative technology company committed to improving health equity for Americas underserved seniors, announces plans to nearly double its geographic footprint. The expansion, which is subject to CMS approval, will make Clovers Medicare Advantage (MA) plans available to eligible individuals in a total of 209 counties across nine states.

### Individuals eligible for Medicare in these new counties can sign up for Clovers plans during the Annual Election Period, which runs from October 15 to December 7, with coverage starting on January 1, 2022.

So, in summary, in additional to all of this i've explained above, they're also doubling their TAM, soooooo, there's that.

Anyway, with all this new and very bullish info over the past couple of months it's probably time for you (yes, I'm pointing at you reading this write up) ...to board the Falcon 9 rocket w/ the rest of us CLOV Apes and stamp your tickets now as we anticipate our moon trip in early 2022.

Well it seems like they've collectively decided to specifically target McDonald's by quitting McDonald's jobs (preferably during the busiest part of a shift), wasting interviewers time by going to interviews for jobs they don't intend to accept, or accepting jobs and never showing up, etc, and posting about it on social media until McDonald's raises their wages. The hope from them seems to be that if they can force McDonald's to raise wages, other companies will then have to raise wages to compete.

[This was](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qtqzun/it_only_takes_one_card_to_take_down_the_house/) the first post I saw about it, this morning, with ~27k upvotes.

[This post](https://ww.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qty4mt/the_mcdonalds_strike_is_on_do_not_shop_or_apply/) was made later in the day, with ~11k upvotes, as a bit of a confirmation of a collective strategy.

I don't know about you, but my world view is that people are fucking lazy and short-sighted, and generally won't follow through on things. However, social media trends are a pretty powerful force, and I don't think we should forget the retarded trend of kids trashing school bathrooms that forced schools to locked students out of the bathrooms. If that can trend, I can't see why this wouldn't.

With the holidays coming up there will be a I'm sure there will be a ton of travelers who've spent the last 2 years stuck in their homes, shoveling dollar menu fries in their fat fucking faces, bored in airports or their cars, looking to get their fix. With supply chain issues already squeezing them from one side, this is literally the worst time for something like this to happen.

I (31M) have 90,000 dollars in marijuana stocks. With the impending departure from prohibition, I feel this must be a safe bet, right?

1,"11/15/2021, 08:35:38",Is this like the dotcom boom? Here's why it isn't,sunnyhundal,"A lot of people think the current stockmarket, and in particular technology stocks and clean energy companies, are overvalued and due for a correction. Some predict a crash as big as the 2000 dotcom bust. As someone who worked at a dotcom companies incubator (called Cube8) in London in 1999, this is nothing like those days.

**For one**, companies in those days were jumping 100-200%+ on the first day of the IPO. Now, *some* are barely jumping 25-30% (Rivian). We haven't even reached near those crazy heights. 

**Secondly**, 2000s Dotcoms had no profits to speak of. Most didn't even have revenue. In contrast, modern tech companies are reaping in record profits. The tech industry will only get bigger. It's influence will permeate every aspect of our lives. Its not a niche, but a coming wave.

The same goes for **clean energy,** in which Tesla is a leader by market valuation. While it looks overvalued, the company makes solid profits, has a highly desirable product line (like Apple), has tech superiority (SpaceX) and cannot get its products out (cars and energy) out fast enough. It is also doing excellent in the three of the most important car markets: California, Germany and China.

As people with far more money than me  [Bill Gates](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/bill-gates-expects-8-to-10-teslas-and-a-google-amazon-and-microsoft.html), BlackRocks [Larry Fink](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-next-1000-unicorns-will-be-in-climate-tech.html)  have predicted, we are about to see more Teslas from the clean energy world. Clean energy is at a tipping point. The coming wave of abundant, cheap, clean energy will unleash another wave of change and growth.

**You could** argue that EV companies like Rivian and Lucid  who have no officially booked revenue yet  are overvalued. Perhaps, but they have developed world-class products about to roll off the production line. Rivian has large orders already. In contrast, traditional car companies are struggling to stay relevant and can't change fast enough. The tipping point towards EVs is arriving faster than anyone expected, especially in Europe.

**There are risks, no doubt.**

\- A *recession* is one, but we have a lot of infrastructure, pent-up savings and strong jobs growth to counter that. 

\- Higher *inflation* is another. But I suspect inflation fears and Covid-19 will cool overheated supply-chains and energy prices.

\- Higher *interest rates*? Central Banks know that the only way raising interest rates would reduce inflation is [if it came as a sharp recession-inducing shock](https://twitter.com/jonsindreu/status/1459861598122688512?s=20). But which CB wants to induce a recession now? Just as we're coming out of a pandemic? That would be madness.

A correction may come anyway - markets are irrational because people are. But I think the fundamentals are still pretty good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qu3qf5/is_this_like_the_dotcom_boom_heres_why_it_isnt/

Just thought I should let people know about a stock that's looking quite interesting. Take a look at SKT. They have a Short Ratio of 21.86 according to Finviz.   


I understand there is much more to a stock than the short ratio however this is definitely interesting and by no means do I suggest you do anything, I am merely trying to inform people. I searched SKT on this subreddit and the most recent thing I could find is from like 6 to 9 months ago. But anyway go take a look and come up with your own wacky analysis. That's the most fun part.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below Ive compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **The premiums on $NNOX are intoxicating.** Options are pricing around a 17% move at the time of writing, but historically $NNOX only moves 9%. Unfortunately for us, the sample size on this company is small, so we need to tread a little more carefully than usual. Regardless, the most $NNOX has ever moved post earnings is 18%, meaning even if we do get a maximum move, we wont lose much money. I will likely opt to sell a 20/28 strangle once I conduct all little more research into the company later this week. I want to see if I can uncover any reasons regarding ***why*** the premiums are so high.

&amp;nbsp;

- **$FL options will be extremely cheap come Friday.** Currently, the options are pricing an 8.3% move relative to the historical move of 9.3% , making them relatively efficient. Given that volatility doesnt inflate throughout the week, these options should become extremely cheap by Friday since theta will murder the extrinsic value on them. Footlocker is no stranger to large moves, and if we can enter a lotto strangle for cheap Thursday before close, we could be looking at a handsome return come Friday morning. A straddle will currently run you $460, but by Friday this number may be closer to $300. If thats the case, Ill roll the dice on this one - I like my odds.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Chinese tech give us an awesome collateral play opportunity!** $KWB is a high liquidity ETF consisting of all of the Chinese tech stocks who report this week. If it behaves anything like American tech does during earnings week, there should be a clear directional move in the entire ETF. If were bullish or bearish on Chinese tech as a whole, we should look to go long or short on $KWB instead of any of the individual tickers in order to mitigate our risks and generate significantly greater profits. For more information on this type of play, check out my in-depth writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

- **$FL options will be extremely cheap come Friday.** Currently, the options are pricing an 8.3% move relative to the historical move of 9.3% , making them relatively efficient. Given that volatility doesnt inflate throughout the week, these options should become extremely cheap by Friday since theta will murder the extrinsic value on them. Footlocker is no stranger to large moves, and if we can enter a lotto strangle for cheap Thursday before close, we could be looking at a handsome return come Friday morning. A straddle will currently run you $460, but by Friday this number may be closer to $300. If thats the case, Ill roll the dice on this one - I like my odds.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Chinese tech give us an awesome collateral play opportunity!** $KWEB is a high liquidity ETF consisting of all of the Chinese tech stocks who report this week. If it behaves anything like American tech does during earnings week, there should be a clear directional move in the entire ETF. If were bullish or bearish on Chinese tech as a whole, we should look to go long or short on $KWEB instead of any of the individual tickers in order to mitigate our risks and generate significantly greater profits.

1,"11/15/2021, 07:25:58",Could SAVA become a trillion dollar market cap company? The hyper bull case.,BigHugeSpreadsheet,"Hello. SAVAge hyper bull here. For the sake of argument, I wanted to show how some moderately aggressive assumptions can lead to a calculation of a 1 trillion dollar market cap for SAVA. I dont necessarily think that all these assumptions will end up turning out to be 100% accurate but I see a lot of valuations on this sub that I think are way too conservative and I wanted to spice things up by actually using aggressive but still realistic assumptions.

^This^ is^ not^ investment^ advice^ you^ apes

First lets define our target market. Im assuming that there are around 6 million Alzheimers patients in the US. The number will be closer to 8.5 million by 2030 which would be like 40% higher than the patient population we are using, and we are entirely omitting the huge patient population of other countries that SAVA would also be treating, but to keep things conservative lets just use 6 million. 

If SAVA has a 50% market penetration, which I think is fairly reasonable seeing as almost the entire patient population is covered by Medicare and the alternative to this medication is to have your loved one succumb to a terrible and preventable disease that will cost hundreds of thousands to millions in caretaker costs, not to mention the terrible emotional toll. So an aggressive but realistic estimate is that around 3 million patients in the US will be on Simufilam sometime in the next decade.

Next we need to determine pricing. One of the most surprising things to me in most peoples valuations be on this sub is that they expect the price of around 10K-25K per patient per year. I appreciate that they are conservative and I think that they are using this price because they basically think yes 12K would be a fair price for this drug that prevents Alzheimers but people using those prices in their valuations are forgetting one teeny tiny thing:

Pharmaceutical prices are almost never even close to fair in the United States.

For better or worse (definitely worse) big pharma charges absolutely disgusting, price gouging prices for life saving medicines all the time. If you need an example of this you need look no further that aduhelm. This drug, which has been *conclusively proven this point not to improve ADAS cog outcomes at all* (i.e. there is no evidence it improves the lives of people with Alzheimers whatsoever) has been approved just because it improves a couple of bio markers and Biogen is charging 56K, I repeat, *56 big ones PER YEAR for a drug that is not even in the same galaxy of effectiveness as Simufilam is.*

So why in the world would Simulflam, a drug which not only halts the mental decline of people with Alzheimers but *REVERSES THE DECLINE*, be priced any less than a drug like aduhelm that does not even work?

*For this reason, I am making the aggressive but realistic assumption that Simulflam will be priced at at least 56K, the current price of Adulhelm*.

Next lets talk about margins. Right now the cost per pill of the average scaled up small molecule medicine is less than a dollar though it does vary from drug to drug. (Source: https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/1/e000571)
For SAVA, Im sure it will take awhile for whoever they partner with to scale up but once they do, they actual cost of producing a years worth of doses should less than $1000 per year (i.e. an absolutely negligible amount and this could be much lower as some pills only cost a few cents to produce.) 

So what costs are left? Well this is a company with literally 12 employees and their cost is also negligible so we are basically left with marketing and selling/distribution. For this, lets look at a company like Pfizer (who SAVA may be partnering with soon by the way but thats a whole other post). Pfizers income statement shows that they spend about 28% of revenues on marketing and distribution costs (Source: https://truecostofhealthcare.org/the_pharmaceutical_industry/). I personally think its going to be a lot cheaper than this to market a game changing drug like Simulflam because basically every doctor in the Alzheimers space that even barely keeps up with new research is going to hear nonstop about this drug after it is approved. It will literally totally reshape the treatment of Alzheimers world wide and you dont have to spend as much to market that as you do for your average unknown niche drug.

So lets assume SAVA pays about 50% of the revenue to whoever they partner with, Id say big pharma companies like Pfizer and Gilead will be climbing over each other to partner at that rate because if marketing and distributing Simufilam s anything like any other normal drug theyd be spending around 28% of the normal revenue of the drug in marketing and distribution, a trivial amount maybe like 2% of revenue in production, and the other 20% of the drugs revenue that they keep basically goes straight to their bottom line, which is right around what their their average profit margin is now.

This would leave SAVA with around 50% of the revenue from Simufilam.. Im sure they will be using some of the money to research other uses for Simufilam and for SAVADx so lets say 10% goes to that. That is a 40% profit margin.

Finally, lets talk about what SAVAs price to earnings ratio could be. The average company in the S&amp;P 500 has a market cap about 30x the companies net profit. Pharma companies have a P/E that is lower and Pfizer for example has a P/E of around 14x. I think SAVA could easily clear 14x seeing as theyd have huge revenue growth and a lot of investor confidence in their pipeline after Simufilam, so Im making the moderately conservative assumption they would have a 15x P/E ratio just so we can use a nice round number here.

*Now lets put it all together: 3 million patients x 56,000 annually per patient x 40% profit margins x 15x Price/Earnings ratio = $1.008 Trillion in market cap or $25,200 per share and roughly a 300x increase from the current price of $68.80*

Now please remember all the things I left out of this already bonkers valuation model:
-No profit from SavaDx which could potentially be a test that nearly every senior takes to diagnose Alzheimers early in the future 
-No profit from treatment of other forms of dementia or any other conditions related to inflammation (this is a massive opportunity could be a post on its own as well).
-No profit from any country outside the US (On average around 55% of pharmaceutical revenues are made on international non-US sales, so this is an absolutely massive opportunity as well) (Source: https://truecostofhealthcare.org/the_pharmaceutical_industry/).

Disclosure: I am long SAVA Jan 2023 $200 calls and I will see you apes either in Valhalla or the welfare office depending on how this phase 3 trial goes.

TL;DR Sava is going up possibly 300x to $25,200 a share if they get approved and hold out for the right partnership.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qu2dqt/could_sava_become_a_trillion_dollar_market_cap/

Ok, so we all know the US Defense budget gets more money than powell's printer, so why not work that to your advantage?

The next US Military budget review is due in around May. This year, the budget was trimmed down by about 15 billion $. Both parties wanted to trim down the budget because they felt spending was a bit too high.

*Afghanistan has entered the chat*

So yeah, afghanistan was a clusterfuck and America seemed to come off as weak. The talibabs literally seized their country back and fired about 4 bullets in the process.

On top of that, you've got sleepy uncle Joe. No matter how you like or dislike him, compared to Trump, he's weak as fuck.

Trump literally talked about dropping nukes and shit, meanwhile Joe is taking a nap.

it's no coincidence whatsoever that papa putin and poohbear seem to have got much more bold with their tones since Joe came into power. Trump was a loose cannon and the russians and chinese were biding their time until he left.

Chubby uncle kim has already done 6 test fire missile launches this year alone.

Papa putin has just stuck 100,000 russian troops and armored divisions on the Ukraine border this week, as though to hint at an invasion. he won't invade but he's rattling the cage.

Poohbear never even turned up to the COP26 climate summit it Scotland for the last 2 weeks, yet he was still able to force all the western powers to back down on their stance on coal reductions.

Also, notice how during orange man's reign, Poohbear limited his actions to ranting about trade tarrifs and steel prices? Now with uncle joe sleeping at the wheel, all he does is bang on about invading Taiwan.

Let's not forget about the constant bitching between Israel and Iran too, with Iran constantly making threats to ramp up it's nuclear programme. 

# Unleash the defence budget

So, with putin, kim and pooh all getting bigger bollocks, afghanistan collapsing, terror attacks in Europe increasing in frequency, Iran pushing for nukes and the US looking suspiciously weak on the global stage, are you seriously telling me that the defence budget is going to be cut again next year? No fucking chance.

It'll either be kept the same, or probably increased.

This means huge cash flowing into companies we can trade.

The biggest contractor of all civil and military applications in the US is Lockheed. After that, it's Boeing, General Dynamics then Ratheon.

Lockheed is a slam dunk for free money. 

Lockeed does work for more than two dozen government agencies from the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is involved in surveillance and information processing for the CIA, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the National Security Agency (NSA), The Pentagon, the Census Bureau, and the Postal Service.

(lel spies in the mail).

Lockheed even roll with renewable energy divisions, but look at their military applciations. Attack helis, patented laser weapons, radar systems, Aegis destroyer defense systems for the entire navy, blackhawks, apaches, C130's etc. Literally, they are a killing machine.

So yeah, fuck it, go long on $LMT

You can run with Boeing if you like, but they have a habit of nuking their own stock price by crashing civilian planes and killing hundreds of people.

Raytheon $RTX might work but their long chart is dogshit.


General Dynamics $GD is up 25% in a year but I can't see anything big long term, especially as the F16 programme is over. 

Grumman $NOC make shit for Nasa but crucially, the B2 stealth bomber, and if there's one thing Iran and Papa Kim will hate, it's stealth bombers.

**Company, Oncology, and Core Business:**

Science Life Sciences (SLS) is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company. Their pipeline (SLS Website): 

https://preview.redd.it/4mr2yjszlmz71.jpg?width=3110&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ae9b3e150b01e3c3480e992b90c607bcf81edd

Galinpepimut-S (GPS) and Nelipepimut-S (NPS) both have shown great results in pre-clinical and clinical trials. Additionally, GPS has a well-tolerable safety profile, with the worst reactions to the immunization being mild rashes during administration and fatigue. 

The administration is in the form of vaccine shots and the current and historic GPS/GPS+ studies displayed OS equivalent/greater than the current standard of care OS (bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy). The brief specifics of the studies can be found here: [https://www.sellaslifesciences.com/pipeline/sellas-pipeline/default.aspx#section=clinical](https://www.sellaslifesciences.com/pipeline/sellas-pipeline/default.aspx#section=clinical)

Phase 2 NPS Trial (Started Oct 14, 2014) results are due Dec, 2021. Phase 3 GPS results are expected in the first half of 2022. 

In 2020, Merck's oncology business revenue was $15.83 Billion - 36.8% of Merck's pharma business revenue. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) accounted for $14.38 Billion of the oncology revenue.

Bristol-Myers' Opdivo (nivolumab) brought in $7 Bill in 2020 revenues.

GPS and GPS+ significantly improve the effectiveness of these drugs. Keep the patients alive longer and the insurance pays longer. (P.S. I will not bore you with the statistical power, # of patients, and statistical significance of these studies. Reference link above)

Additionally, China (3D Med) has shown early interest in GPS. In Dec 2020, SLS announced a $202 million licensing agreement with 3D Med for the development and commercialization of GPS and GPS+ in greater China. So far, SLS has received roughly $10m from the milestone payments. 

SLS Cash position is \~$30 million as of Q3 2021. SLS historic quarterly burn is $2-4 mill. Practically 0 debt in their capital structure. Most of their expenses are R&amp;D. Current ratio = 8.2 (industry average 1.5-2)

**Industry:**

""Furthermore, oncology therapeutics accounted for $143 billion in branded pharmaceutical sales in 2019approximately 20 percent of global pharmaceutical sales. Analyst consensus figures indicate a robust 12 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR), and global oncology therapeutics sales are forecasted to hit $250 billion by 2024."" - McKinsey &amp; Company [https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/delivering-innovation-2020-oncology-market-outlook](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/delivering-innovation-2020-oncology-market-outlook)

The stock price is heavily manipulated. I believe short funds cover their short positions on dark pools/other sourcing. By doing so they are able to significantly reduce the market impact of large buy orders. 

SLS has a float of 15.8 million. The average daily trading volume has been between 100k-150k 3m. 

As of yesterday, there are roughly 0.8 - 1.2 million short-sold shares needed to be bought back (a little difficult to calculate with FINRA reporting wonky values - their Nov 12 reported trading volume was \~650k while yahoo and other sources report \~1.3m). 

RSI 6,14, 20 all &gt;= 30 (reference image above). 

*The current market cap is 114M. SLS has a patent on GPS (approved earlier this year). Analyst target estimates are $15-21.* 

Overall, this has been a brief introduction to Sellas Life Sciences. I would hate to see a company with a proven drug being shorted to nothing. If any of you have encountered cancer in your lives you are well aware of the physiological and physical strain of the current standard of care treatment (primarily chemotherapy). National Cancer Institute consensus study on prioritization of cancer antigens ranked the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein as the top immunotherapy target in cancer.

It seems towards the end of the rotations we've been having starting with value stocks and ending with mega pumps from SPACs, companies with zero revenue \*cough Rivian\*, and weed stonks.

**Catalyst**

Rumor has it, that Rep. Mace (R) from SC is proposing a bill to legalize Marijuana at the Federal level. ""Those whove [seen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/republicans-pot-bill-to-propose-lower-taxes-more-state-control) Maces draft say it would regulate cannabis more like alcohol"". This bill coming from the republican side may garner more support than Sen. Schumer's already proposed bill. "" Maces proposed excise tax is 3.75%, according to Cobb -- a fraction of the 25.5% that Schumers legislation would put on marijuana products."" Personally, I've heard this bill could be brought forward as early as Monday 11/15. But, that's just chatter.

**Well, which dank stock should I buy?**

I've looked at various companies and honestly diversifying into a few may be worth it. However, I have the greatest conviction in **$TLRY** the largest market share in Canada, Germany, and ties to the US with Sweetwater brewing. Those with the greatest dependence on the US may outperform. But, screw the fundamentals because that's not how this market works.

\*for simplicity I'll just illustrate $TLRY to represent the Marijuana sector since it has the largest market cap\*

**Institutions buying $420M+?**

In general, Institutions have been buying these Cannabis companies as they blew off earlier in the year. Heaviest buying has been in $TLRY with the heaviest selling in $SNDL. Interestingly most of the buys come during Q2 which means most of these institutional apes are holding some serious bags. They could be down anywhere from -4% to -33% depending on when they bought in Q2. So, don't be surprised if this gets pumped and ultimately dumped to lighten their bags.

**Leaders in the Sector?**

**$ACB** and **$SNDL** currently lead the move upward as they are right at their 200-day moving average. Does that mean they'll continue leading the way? I don't know. Does that mean the others have more to run? I can't see the future, you twit. As a result, diversifying in this sector might be the way to go.

**Crayons**

It appears **$TLRY** has started to round out and will try to push hire. The green lines are historical supply/demand lines at candle closes. I'm setting my stop near the recent low of $9.98 and will continue to sell out starting at $15.50 to $30.00 for a gain close to between 20% and 130%.

**Social Traction**

Another reason I am choosing to look at **$TLRY** is because of all the weed stocks, **$TLRY** gains the most attention on google trends and is the 2nd most mentioned on WSB behind **$SNDL.**

**Positions**

I literally have none and plan on buying Monday with any of you that like the stock(s). I'll update after buys are in.

 **Catalyst**

Rumor has it, that Rep. Mace (R) from SC is proposing a bill to legalize Marijuana at the Federal level. ""Those whove [seen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/republicans-pot-bill-to-propose-lower-taxes-more-state-control) Maces draft say it would regulate cannabis more like alcohol"".  This bill coming from the republican side may garner more support than Sen. Schumer's already proposed bill. "" Maces proposed excise tax is 3.75%, according to Cobb -- a fraction of the 25.5% that Schumers legislation would put on marijuana products."" Personally, I've heard this bill could be brought forward as early as Monday 11/15. But, that's just chatter. 

**Well, which dank stock should I buy?**

I've looked at various companies and honestly diversifying into a few may be worth it. However, I have the greatest conviction in **$TLRY** the largest market share in Canada, Germany, and ties to the US with Sweetwater brewing. Those with the greatest dependence on the US may outperform. But, screw the fundamentals because that's not how this market works. 

\*for simplicity I'll just illustrate $TLRY to represent the MJ sector since it has the largest marketcap\*

**Institutions buying $420M+?**

In general, Institutions have been buying these MJ companies as they blew off earlier in the year. Heaviest buying has been in $TLRY with the heaviest selling in $SNDL. Interestingly most of the buys come during Q2 which means most of these institutional apes are holding some serious bags. They could be down anywhere from -4% to -33% depending on when they bought in Q2. So, don't be surprised if this gets pumped and ultimately dumped to lighten their bags.

This is going to be a completely new wave of technology and certain companies may rise similar to the dotcom bubble. The dotcom bubble was essentially the rise of the internet and the potential it had, which caused investors to chase the momentum of insane growth in those companies. Now with the Metaverse, I believe we could see the same thing occur again. The metaverse will be something so different and become such a high growth industry, that earnings will be BLOWN out. Think about it, there are already many people unable to leave their rooms because of being too invested in certain video games or netflix series, etc. Introduce a world that you can be the person of your dreams, live in the space of your dreams, live supernatural experiences, be in control of absolutely everything, and not have to step out of your room. The Metaverse eventually will have graphics that seem real and I wouldn't be surprised if they introduce additional products which help you feel, smell, taste, etc. Living in reality will become pathetic compared to being in the Metaverse.

By using this post, you agree to hold me harmless from any ramifications, * financial or otherwise, that occur to you as a result of acting on information found on this post. Please DYOD and double check everything from hereon in.

Before I begin, I want to give a personal thank you to wolfofnallstreet for the following disclaimer (it worked for them so Im not going to remake the wheel):

As we all know, the coin-that-shall-not-be-named is off-limits from this sub, so from this point on, I will refer to it as corn. Modsalthough corn is critical to this play, the positions themselves are in stocks and options, not c*ypto, so it should abide by the sub's rules.

Additionally, I want to shoutout for making me money; however, I believe they omitted a crucial miner: Bitfarms (Bitf). My question for the community and the reason for me positing this isam I missing something?

Call Positions/YOLO: 
700 Nov 10
350 Dec 7.5
100 Feb 5

Much like the aforementioned miners, bitfarms generates revenue by utilizing mining rigs and energy to generate corn. Ultimately there are 3 tangible variables and 1 nebulous variable that should make up bitfarms price. 1) How much corn they generate/hold, 2) how much it costs for them to generate corn, and 3) how much corn can be sold for. The intangible is 4) management/marketing/market conditions. 

1) Bitf has a hash rate of 1.8 EH/s; and holds 2646 corn; they mined 343 in October. Comparatively, Riot has a hash rate of 2.2 EH/s; and holds 2921 corn; they mined 464 corns in October. The market cap of Bitf is 1.42B|riot is 4.24

-this alone has me confused. The market cap of Bitf is ~1/3 which means that you should expect something about the ability to generate corn to be commensurate. While there is a small advantage held by riot in terms of mining capacity, it surely isnt triple and the numbers generated in October are on par with the discrepancy of mining capacity. The amount of corn held in reserves is negligible. From this alone, if riot is accurately priced (will hopefully be higher per the wolf as above after earnings), BITF should be ~3B which would be a share price of approximately 16 and thus trading more in line with Hut8 (another corn mining stock...not here to argue which is better)

2) In addition to just generation, the price it costs (due to the cost of energy) to mine corn differs between energy sources. It costs Bitf $9000 to generate a corn. That means at current prices its raking in $54,000/corn. One major argument against corn is that it is bad for the environment. Bitf prides itself on using hydroelectric energy for their corn operation. Not only does this company have one buzzwordcornit has twogreen energy.

3) C*ypto has gone ballistic again and November has traditionally been a good time for corn. I am not going to pretend that I have enough brain wrinkles to tell you why it will continue this pattern but the pattern has held so far and given the above positions, I am hoping it happens again. Buy the dip before the rip 

4) Traditionally management for bit farms has been lacking. They dont market themselves well. Coupled with this they just recently had a dilution. Sounds familiar(riot)

Marketing has recently gotten better with the announcement that they bought a hydropower plant in Washington state (10 farms in operation or under development in 4 countries) and even more importantly they put a rocket in their twitter announcement for Q3 ER &lt;https://twitter.com/Bitfarms_io&gt;. That sounds like something Papa Musk would do before a blowout.

Dilution: The price was maddeningly pinned at 5.49 for at least a month after the offering and then all of a sudden (I suspect the offering had been bought) the price starts to move upward. If after the bell on Monday (earning report) they report that the offering has closed, I hope for a new 52 week high. HUT8 had a wonderful ER and I dont see anything that should prevent this from doing the same.

Spot ETF of corn was recently denied; while this is viewed by may in the c*ypto community as a setback, it actually may represent a catalyst for mining companies as mining company stock/options may be a corn surrogate for companies wanting exposure to that market.

As such, if corn prices hold, my plan is calls and even more of them. I dont want to take away from riot as I believe it too will go up but believe this has a higher upside. What am I missing?

I put together some data for upcoming earnings this week through Wednesday. Basically I was looking to build a snapshot of each company. The POS. column is a result of compiling the options contracts ending the week with the highest open interest. My actual position is to the far left. $SPREAD indicates the range between the current price and the strike price of the contract. NET/GROSS is for the last reported yearly financials. All data was pulled from either Yahoo or Nasdaq. Numbers are accurate-ish. I have no background in finance, so Im expecting to learn from this. Would definitely appreciate feedback from those who know what they're doing. I understand IV crush limits or extinguishes profits on contracts held through earnings, so Im taking positions that I think will have meaningful price movement. Green on the row means I have calls, and red puts.

QFIN: this company has a low and positive P/E and lower estimate for the next year. They beat earnings last quarter by 25.42% and a profit margin of 25.78%. A price point of 26.04 is affordable they're involved in data so Im giving it a go.

MVST: there's a lot better DD on this site than this, but overall it looks like they're going to start growing into positive earnings, and if contracts with USPS come through, it'll be a great play. beat earnings last quarter by 91%. The options with the highest open interest are puts, but I see a great upside here.

DAVA: This company has a high P/E but they beat earnings and have a profit margin of 28.24%. The options with leading OI are already ITM.

STNE: Looks solid across the board. Affordable. crushed EPS last quarter. good profit margin.

SBLK: Affordable. Super low P/E estimate. Maybe moving into big earnings. Still positive profit margin. Might do a late DOE on this.

DLO: affordable: PM is huge. Big upside on the favored strike price.

WPC: a little pricey. Looks like a solid company overall.

TGT: Huge upside for puts. The spread makes me think people know something I don't. 83% of open interest is for puts here. Would really like to hear someones opinion on this.

LOW: Same as TGT. huge spread of the strike price. Less percentage overall for puts. A lot of analysts are saying its over weight. Maybe they'll have dog shit earnings?

ZIM: this seems like the star of the show. The financials are solid. Super low P/E estimate. nice spread on strike price. Insane profit margin. Big time go.

NVDA: everyones buying this anyway.

YY: no position here yet. Just curious how they have a negative operating cost that puts NET above Gross.

Please let me know if Im a total smooth brain retard or what. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtz08q/dd_earnings_on_111521_week/

This bill has passed 60 years in a row, and will pass with or without SAFE Banking. Many expect it wont be, but the two versions of the bill will have to be reviewed by the House Committee prior to being sent to POTUS.

With a primary goal and focus of the company to put out solutions that bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets for major participants.Reasons to Invest:

**1)** **Attractive Market that is large and growing at triple-digit rates**

**a.** Per the Marketforce article released last month, the DeFi market size soared by 335% year-over-year to roughly $85 billion by the end of sept. 2021

**b.** The market is anticipated to grow into an $800 billion market (10-fold) by as early as 2022 year-end

**2)** **Hyper-Speed Growing Market means significant room for pick-and-shovel companys AKA a Company can offer services into this market and enjoy the robust tailwinds / growth without direct exposure / being a cryptcurrency itself**

**a.** Gex Management is using technology, the most scalable tool we have in 2021, to identify major  
paint points in the value chain of DeFI and fix them through offerings via their internally developed  
GOATX platform. Description of these services mentioned in detail further down.

**3)** **The GOATX Platform: In-House Technology with robust IP and significant capabilities:**

I encourage you to sign-up and go through the companys very comprehensive platform, it is quite impressive and the infrastructure is in place when you enter your account dashboard..Mobile App launching soon!!!!: [**https://goatx.com/#/home**](https://goatx.com/#/home)

**a.** Home Tab: Your account dashboard --&gt; Shows all your wallets consolidated, Latest Transactions,  
Fiat Transactions, Balances and Pools / Farms

Populates all transactions from all wallets, including tokens sent, tokens received, date, and your cost  
basis

**b.** Trade Tab: Connect any wallet and begin trading instantly with many features

**c.** Research: DeFi Research on tokens, platforms, events, global data, as well as research on Farms /  
Pools, Exchanges, Derivatives and Trending Coins

**4)** **The Leader of the Ship: Mr. Edward Honour (Chief Technology Officer). This is the individual driving the impressive technology behind the Company owns, and his resume with 30+ Years of experience is nothing to look past:**

**a.** Mr. Honour has 30+ years of experience in programming / technology development: 10+ years of  
senior experience at Oracle in various Software / engineering / programming positions.

**b.** Other positions include: senior roles (CTO) with Multiplayer Gaming Technologies, MGT  
Lottery Technologies and txtSchedules

**c.** Ed was the Chief Blockchain Architect at Tritanium Labs who developed the Traceability Blockchain, public blockchain for supply chain traceability

**5)** **Your potential multiple on return is HUGE given the TINY $12M Market Cap this Company Boasts (Comparable Company Analysis Below):**

**a.** Comparable 1: Hive Blockchain (Ticker: $HIVE) / Market Cap: $2.13B --&gt; Since December of 2019,  
Hive is up 5100% / 51x

**b.** Comparable 2: Bitfarm (Ticker: $BITF) / Market Cap: $1.63B --&gt; In the last year Bitfarm is up 1700%  
or 17x

**c.** Comparable 3: DeFI Technologies (Ticker: $DEFTF) / Market Cap: $800M --&gt; In the last year DeFI is  
up 1800% or 18x

**6)** **Technical Analysis: If you look at the technical, the price appreciated to $.17 before profit taking started, we are now at $.08 and the stock has fully stabilized with downward pressure halted / disappearing. With minimal walls (none) above, the right catalysts can send the stock price flying in a very short period of time.**

**7)** **Strong execution demonstrated since announcement just 2 months ago, with several press releases and filmed interviews announcing exciting catalysts (with many catalysts approaching in the very near term) including:**

**a.** (Oct. 7 Press release) launching a full suite of tax compliance and accounting products in time for  
the 2021 tax filing season, called CryptBooks. One of the most common complaints from DeFi  
investors is the difficulty in remaining compliant with accounting and tax filing.

The nature of blockchain platforms and DeFi exchanges does not allow for the easy reporting of  
realized gains and losses. With GXXMs launch of the GOATx DeFi platform GEX has access to pricing  
and market data for most cryptcurrency tokens traded today. The technologies developed by GEX for  
the GOATx platform enable users to retroactively generate accounting reports for all trades, even  
those prior to the launch of GOATx

**b.** (Sept. 16 Press Release) GXXM Launches GOATX DeFi Management Platform as a sponsor of SALT  
Conference VIP Kickoff

Launched its DeFi Trading, Research, and Portfolio Management tool at the SALT New York 2021  
Conference Tuesday, September 14th. GoatX was a sponsor of the VIP reception along with Battlefin,  
Market Revolution and others which includes Kevin Oleary, Jon Najarin and Marc LoPresti.

In the press release linked below, you can see the Gex management team with Kevin OLeary, one of  
the most reputable crypt currency investors out there, as well as GXXMs platform GOATX as a logo  
on Mr. OLearys banner behind the group: [https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news- release/2021/09/16/2298439/0/en/Gex-Management-Inc-s-subsidiary-launches-GOATX-DeFi- Management-Platform-as-a-sponsor-of-SALT-Conference-VIP-Kickoff.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/16/2298439/0/en/Gex-Management-Inc-s-subsidiary-launches-GOATX-DeFi-Management-Platform-as-a-sponsor-of-SALT-Conference-VIP-Kickoff.html)

**c.** (Sept 28 Press Release) GXXM entered into a crypt data marketing agreement expected to add  
significantly to revenues with Battlefins Ensemble Marketplace

This agreement enables GXXM and Battlefin to reach the vast institutional and family office client base  
that actively use Battlefins marketplace. Family offices and institutions alike are in high-demand for  
the Companys proprietary technologies and operation of the GOATX DeFi platform which allows  
GXXM to provide unmatched access to cryptcurrency based datasets.

# # 2. Social Metaverse Investing

You know, before formally introducing this writing, I have to admit that there is a particular challenge when it comes to writing this book and that is modifying for correct predictions or fundamental market shifts. This statement existed in the financial technology chapter but makes more sense to move up  here in the technology introduction where we discuss the evolution of social media. That is because the subject of conversation for the next few years will be the metaverse or the third iteration of the internet. This subject of conversation was essentially referenced in this chapter but the information is far more clear now and requires this final edit or revision. So let's begin.

It likely makes sense to discuss and break down what a social network really is since it is something that has significantly changed human behavior. I like to invest in what I frame as intent-based social media and this is likely a function of my age and relationship with the internet. An intent-based social media platform is a network where the user is likely to use the application as a tool before considering entertainment. In short, social media exists on a spectrum ranging from intention to entertainment. One could see how a platform like TikTok is geared toward entertainment, while a platform like Pinterest is designed for intention. In this spectrum, we find many others in the middle like YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.

This spectrum is critical to understand because it governs what kind of algorithms are used to drive the platform. In the case of entertainment-based media, like Instagram or TikTok, the platform seeks to understand the user so that it can fetch content that will entertain them. Entertainment is a highly subjective endeavor which forces the platforms to depend on algorithms to connect users and content. It is the open field form. On the other side, the intent-based platform serves a designed function and relationship with the content creator. For example, we visit Pinterest to create useful ideas, allowing content-creators to focus on the context of the platform. Google indexes websites so that users can portal into a library of website owners and services. Reddit curates loyal communities to drive its information and space.

The critical element of this spectrum is the complex conversations that drive privacy and security on platforms. Social media is how we interface with the internet and it is what we refer to as the second iteration of the internet. To briefly shift the tone of this conversation, the entertainment platform suffer from misinformation and propaganda driven campaigns. This is a natural consequence of relying on algorithms that depend on short and effective messaging and may ultimately affect intent-based platforms that orbit closer to entertainment, like Reddit or Youtube. They are called Influencers after all. The conversations surrounding privacy ultimately discuss these worst-case scenarios, so they're important to be mindful of historically and forward-looking.

With this issue highlighted, I would like to admit that one of my prediction about Facebook was correct. It will exist in social media forever, due to most applications using Facebook's software development ecosystems to create websites and applications on any device. This is similar to how Oracle will essentially exist forever as part of the computing world due to its widespread demand for system maintenance and improvements. This is set in stone and Facebook's drive for the metaverse ultimately points to how the leadership behind Facebook understands that social media is a forum that ebbs and flows with the population over time. So let's explore the thinking behind the leading social media platform and why it knows how to navigate and pivot its product over the years and how it lead to Roblox becoming Facebook's primary competitor for the next decade by examining Pinterest so that we can understand what social media truly is as a first generation investor.

A social media platform is a forum. A forum is a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged. Each forum accomplishes this in its own unique way.  Twitter is fundamentally used to search for what someone is saying, while Pinterest is used to search for ideas. Pinterest is a particularly interesting case due to hundreds of millions of women adopting the platform and achieving what Google+ had failed to accomplish - a social media platform that harnesses the power of search. I believe this is also an interesting examination of how influential women are to the market. One can question if Apple or Google would be as successful as they are without the seismic changes that the American workforce has adapted.

This spectrum distinction continues be important when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat because an investor would not want to mistake the differences between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart. So is Pinterest a social media platform, search service, or both? With this in mind, we might begin to see why Facebook implementing a hashtag, Instagram implementation stories, or TikTok implementing streams may be irrelevant when understanding the full potential of a service like Snapchat or Twitter and the wisdoms the drive its growth in the market. Before ever investing in a company you need to discover and completely understand the incentives that drive the customers to return to the product. Without that, you are ultimately gambling in the market and driving through a fog hoping that things will turn out well.

What drives a social networking site is a users incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is best served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

The forum may take on a different medium. Google is used to answer information, Facebook allows us to connect, while online gaming satisfies our needs for adventure. When you examine the nature of a forum and a users incentive to participate in that forum, youll come to understand why a applications like Twitter, Pinterest, or online games like Roblox are a force of nature. These forums engage and fulfill our very real needs and demands as social beings. It will also help you understand why companies like Facebook would endeavor in metaverse products like virtual reality games and other forms of social media.

Pinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or Reddit, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. This is what is known as personal media rather than typical social media. This is a characteristic that I believe grants a media platform a longer product lifespan. It will also be quite relevant when it comes to conversations about how users interact with the metaverse. Clearly, there will be users that enjoy the extroverted elements of it, while introverted users may prefer the personal media aspects of it. What I try to imagine is that the Instagram ""mall"" may be a more social space than the Pinterest ""mall"" in the metaverse.

The network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in is word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine rather than an application to connect with friends or family. As a result, Pinterests recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.  This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption. Most American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users.  

These customers are voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterests customers are in a high willingness to engage with things that result in action. In other words, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future. Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is effectively a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know theyre getting top ""real estate"" advertisements. With a simple search, youre welcomed to a rich library of consumable ideas for health, gifts, beauty, travelling, home developments, and millions of other regularly marketed products that influence the home.

Pinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the platform as a power tool. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different from Facebooks connect-everything approach to social-networking. It is less wasteful and more effective.

You may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new. As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less ""the web"", where website links are the lifeblood to Google search. A good link is extremely valuable to Google.

Due to this relationship, it is in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best, fastest, and most well-rounded results. This means that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.  This partially explains why searching for ""Lebron James"" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites.  Similarly, searching for ""Vegan food near me"" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.

There are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb; the more well-developed a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of well-developed changes. An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develop tools like in-app browsers and support integration with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader of the internet. Part of the global competition is shaping the internets development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately the access to information, which is as statistically scarce as the access to clean water and sanitation around the globe. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life and scale as one of the most valuable internet properties similar to how Roblox breeched the family household and maintained relevancy over the years. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest and things like Roblox are a reliable and effective advertising space.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I regularly seek to delete it. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest, I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. And Facebook is pivoting itself to exist in such a way that it is impossible to delete. That, to me, is incredible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtxly7/my_mental_model_for_investing_in_social_media/

**DISCA/DISCB/DISCK - Discovery:**

We are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including linear platforms such as pay-television (""pay-TV""), free-to-air, and broadcast television, authenticated GO applications, digital distribution arrangements, content licensing arrangements, and direct-to-consumer (""DTC"") subscription products. As one of the worlds largest pay-TV programmers, we provide original and purchased content and live events to approximately 3.7 billion cumulative subscribers and viewers worldwide through networks that we wholly or partially own. As of September 30, 2021, we had 20 million total paid DTC subscribers. We distribute customized content in the U.S. and over 220 other countries and territories in nearly 50 languages. We have an extensive library of content and own most rights to our content and footage, which enables us to leverage our library to quickly launch brands and services into new markets and on new platforms. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms. [Q3 10Q Filing](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)

Discovery owns a lot of its own content and replays them on its own channels. This is going to be huge for Discoverys new move into the direct-to-consumer space under their service named **Discovery+.** Also, they currently have an upcoming merger deal that they will hopefully close in the middle of 2022. This deal will merge Discovery inc. with Warner Brothers media. I will touch on this later in more detail, but just know that there is a lot of content that they have already on the sideline that is sought after by viewers.

Below is a list of the channels owned by Discovery:

**Discovery breaks itself down into the following segments:**

* **USA Networks and International Networks each have the following categories**  

   * **Advertising -** Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. [- Q3 10Q Page 36](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)
   * \*\*Distribution - \*\*Distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from subscription video-on-demand content licensing and DTC subscription services. [- Q3 10Q Page 36](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)
   * **Other -** This is miscellaneous revenue related to the specific networks.

*Note: There were revenue increases, but this is also due to acquisitions made by Discovery Inc. rather than only the core business. While the acquisitions strengthen the core business now I just wanted to note that in case you see some odd revenue upticks such as 2018 when Scripps was acquired.*

*Below you can see how the revenues have grown since 2013:*

* EV/EBITDA: \~3.53
* Current Cash as of Q3 2021: $3.116B
* Total Debt as of Q3 2021: $14.785B

**Industry**

* One trend that has been noticeable especially over the last few years is the move from cable TV to the online subscription model(See Chart 1 below). Discovery just launched their subscription service, Discovery+, at the beginning of the year they have been able to amass 20M subscribers. The large majority of its revenue and advertising are still being brought in from the traditional cable tv market, but that is why they have launched their own DTC subscription service. Fortune Business Insights released a report where they expect the Video streaming market to reach an $842.93B valuation with a 12% CAGR. This is up from the $342.44B market size in 2019 ([Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/12/2333147/0/en/Worldwide-Video-Streaming-Market-Industry-is-Expected-to-Reach-USD-842-93-Billion-by-2027-at-a-CAGR-of-12-0-from-2021.html)). They are going to be competing with companies/services like Netflix, Disney+, FuboTV, Roku, Amazon Prime, Apple TV, and Peacock.  

   * Now this industry growth is huge and CEO David Zaslav expects Discovery to gain some market share, especially with the upcoming merger with WarnerMedia. Zaslav stated that We think it could be \[up to\] 400 million homes over the long term when speaking about the expected subscribers.

**Merger with WarnerMedia:**

* In the first half of 2021 Discovery and Warnermedia announced an exciting opportunity to merge their brands to create a new entity. This deal was an absolute steal because AT&amp;T is essentially spinning this off at a loss and Discovery will have access to a huge lot of movies and shows with large brands. Below you can see the mixture of Discovery brands and Warnermedia brands that are going to be combined under this merger. One item to note is the large number of sports channels that are owned by both companies since there will likely be an offering for live streaming the games or events through the DTC platforms rather than just traditional cable tv channels. One of the great things about Discoverys TV shows is that they do not cost as much as the high-budget WarnerMedia items because of the way that live tv is produced versus scripted TV shows. Also, since these TV shows have already been produced and paid for via the original advertising, both platforms now have the opportunity to sell these brands for a second time without needing to incur any more charges besides the cost of maintaining the platforms. While Netflix has been trying to create their own TV show brands they still license a large portion of their current offering which is why this HBO and Discovery merger is such a big move. One of the great parts of merging the companies is that the subscribers likely wont cannibalize each other due to the difference in content. We will likely see an offering similar to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN where there are combined packages, but also separate offerings in case you only want one product. As of Q3 2021, **Discovery currently reported that they have 20 million subscribers(**[**link**](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/discovery-q3-2021-earnings-warnermedia-streaming-david-zaslav-1235103627/)**) and AT&amp;T reported that HBO and HBO max have 69.4 million subscribers(**[**link**](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hbo-max-q3-2021-subscribers-att-warnermedia-earnings-1235094282/)**).**

* **Financials of the Merger**  

   * The first item to note is how the actual deal will work for the shareholders and Discovery &amp; AT&amp;Ts portion of the deal. Discovery will own 29% of the new company while AT&amp;T will own 71% of the new company. Also, DISCA, DISCB, and DISCK will be merged into one set of shares which is why I will be buying the C shares and using the C shares valuation for my numbers. These trade at a discount due to the lack of voting rights.

* Now the economics of the deal have been spelled out and shown via the presentation made in the middle of the year ([link](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_presentations/2021/ATT-Discovery-WM-05172021-FINAL.pdf)). The merger is expected to have \~$52B of revenue and \~$14B of expected EBITDA in 2023(Slide 10). Along with this revenue expectation they are targeting $15B+ of direct-to-consumer revenues in 2023. They expect to have around \~4.5x to \~5x leverage compared to their expected EBITDA. Zaslav recently mentioned that he expects the debt leverage to be around 4.5x ([link](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-zaslav-kevin-mayer-1235103664/)).

* Lastly, the sum of parts valuation presented by The Popular Investor Channel ([link to the explanation](https://youtu.be/4qyFRi51BY4?t=1164)). There are multiple ways to come up with a sum of parts for this evaluation, but I wanted to use Robs video so that new investors can follow along rather than needing to spell it all out here(.....aka I am being lazy). I recreated his sheet on the DCF worksheet if you would like to go in and make your own edits. I think his calculation looks like the correct estimate, but I think the multiple should be 11 while the net debt/EBITDA ratio can be a little higher (This is to be more conservative). I will leave it the same on the sheet so you can see the comparison, but you can clearly see there is a lot of upside on this. You can also use terminal multiples to come to a conclusion if you would rather take a simpler approach.

**Strengths:**

1. Brand Name and reputation -  

   1. Discovery Inc. has a ton of household names for both the channels/production they own and the actual shows that they produce. Discovery networks are also among the most-watched networks on TV. For traditional TV ratings during the most recent quarter (Q1 2021), Discovery held four of the top 15 primetime networks among its key demo of women 25-54 (TLC ranked #1. ([Link](https://corporate.discovery.com/discovery-newsroom/discovery-networks-claim-top-rankings-in-2021-beta-research-brand-identity-study/))
2. Subscriber Growth  

   1. They have reached 20 million subscribers on just the Discovery+ platform in 3 quarters since it just launched at the beginning of this year. The ad spend has slowed down due to the upcoming merger and they plan to package HBO Max and Discovery+ into an offering for both platforms.

**Risks:**

1. Current Leverage position  

   1. Their total debt as of Q3 2021 is $14.785B and their TTM FCF as of Q3 2021 is $2.082B. While the management team has a good track record of lowering debt quickly it is still an important item to note because of the risk this poses to the business model. If you would like to see the makeup of their current debt you can look on pages 18 &amp; 19 of their [Q3 2021 10Q](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf) for a better explanation of their debt. This is a big risk to the business if there was any substantial downturn in the US economy since they would likely not be able to keep up with their debt payments. This should be factored in with your margin of safety because of the large debt component. The merger will also have a good amount of leverage, but we are focusing on just Discovery so I did not want to include it on the risks just yet. Once the merger is approved we will add in the new debt here.

1. Merger not being completed or being stopped by regulators  

   1. Discovery has a lot of content for viewers, but it is likely not enough to get substantial gains on the subscriber growth front of their business. David Zaslav knows that they need to be operating at scale and see that the merger will allow them to do just that. While there are agreed-upon penalty payments depending on who terminates the merger, if it were announced that the merger did not go through we will likely see a short-term decline in stock price. This market has been very reactionary and from the most recent earnings call it sounds like this company has the green light so far.

**What are their plans for the future?**

1. Merge with WarnerMedia and grow out their Discovery+ platform along with HBOMax to give customers value.
2. Decrease leverage from an estimated 5x leverage going into the merge to 3x leverage.

**Closing Thoughts:**

There is a lot of risk in respect to the current debt on their balance sheet and the incoming leverage if the merger is approved. The management team has proven that they are aware of the effects of leverage and want to pay it down, but if there is a substantial downturn in the economy it will hurt Discovery the higher their leverage. The opportunity with WarnerMedia is going to be huge if they are able to merge the companys costs and employees. If/When the merger goes through they will have a lot of the top-performing channels and the top-performing tv and movie series. I currently like this company and plan on adding around the $25-$26 level for DISCK.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtwrrq/discovery_value_trap_or_undervalued_media/

**Introduction:**

If you missed the Archaegos blow-up in the first few months of 2021 then you are going to want to buckle up to see how disconnected this stock price is from the value of the business.

TLDR: Company stock price goes up when monkey only needs to put in 1 banana instead of two bananas........*value investing like a sir.*

*Disclaimer: I do not currently own a position in this company, but I am looking to build out a position ahead of the merger.*

If you want to view the post with the pictures embedded you can look at my substack post [here](https://joshsinvestmentideas.substack.com/p/discovery-value-trap-or-undervalued).

**DISCA/DISCB/DISCK - Discovery:**

We are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including linear platforms such as pay-television (""pay-TV""), free-to-air, and broadcast television, authenticated GO applications, digital distribution arrangements, content licensing arrangements, and direct-to-consumer (""DTC"") subscription products. As one of the worlds largest pay-TV programmers, we provide original and purchased content and live events to approximately 3.7 billion cumulative subscribers and viewers worldwide through networks that we wholly or partially own. As of September 30, 2021, we had 20 million total paid DTC subscribers. We distribute customized content in the U.S. and over 220 other countries and territories in nearly 50 languages. We have an extensive library of content and own most rights to our content and footage, which enables us to leverage our library to quickly launch brands and services into new markets and on new platforms. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms. [Q3 10Q Filing](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)

Discovery owns a lot of its own content and replays them on its own channels. This is going to be huge for Discoverys new move into the direct-to-consumer space under their service named **Discovery+.** Also, they currently have an upcoming merger deal that they will hopefully close in the middle of 2022. This deal will merge Discovery inc. with Warner Brothers media. I will touch on this later in more detail, but just know that there is a lot of content that they have already on the sideline that is sought after by viewers.

Below is a list of the channels owned by Discovery:













**Discovery breaks itself down into the following segments:**

* **USA Networks and International Networks each have the following categories**
   * **Advertising -** Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. [\- Q3 10Q Page 36](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)
   * **Distribution** \- Distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from subscription video-on-demand content licensing and DTC subscription services. [\- Q3 10Q Page 36](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)
   * **Other -** This is miscellaneous revenue related to the specific networks.

*Note: There were revenue increases, but this is also due to acquisitions made by Discovery Inc. rather than only the core business. While the acquisitions strengthen the core business now I just wanted to note that in case you see some odd revenue upticks such as 2018 when Scripps was acquired.*

*Below you can see how the revenues have grown since 2013:*

**

**Financials:**

* Total Revenue TTM as of Q3 2021: $11.89B
* Profit Margin has been floating between \~12% - 15%



* Current P/E: \~15
   * DISCA: \~15
   * DISCB: \~20
   * DISCK: \~14
* EV/EBITDA: \~3.53
* Current Cash as of Q3 2021: $3.116B
* Total Debt as of Q3 2021: $14.785B

**Industry**

* One trend that has been noticeable especially over the last few years is the move from cable TV to the online subscription model(See Chart 1 below). Discovery just launched their subscription service, Discovery+, at the beginning of the year they have been able to amass 20M subscribers. The large majority of its revenue and advertising are still being brought in from the traditional cable tv market, but that is why they have launched their own DTC subscription service. Fortune Business Insights released a report where they expect the Video streaming market to reach an $842.93B valuation with a 12% CAGR. This is up from the $342.44B market size in 2019 ([Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/12/2333147/0/en/Worldwide-Video-Streaming-Market-Industry-is-Expected-to-Reach-USD-842-93-Billion-by-2027-at-a-CAGR-of-12-0-from-2021.html)). They are going to be competing with companies/services like Netflix, Disney+, FuboTV, Roku, Amazon Prime, Apple TV, and Peacock.
   * Now this industry growth is huge and CEO David Zaslav expects Discovery to gain some market share, especially with the upcoming merger with WarnerMedia. Zaslav stated that We think it could be \[up to\] 400 million homes over the long term when speaking about the expected subscribers.

[*Chart 1: Cable TV forecast through 2028 from Grand View Research*](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/pay-television-tv-market)



**Merger with WarnerMedia:**

* In the first half of 2021 Discovery and Warnermedia announced an exciting opportunity to merge their brands to create a new entity. This deal was an absolute steal because AT&amp;T is essentially spinning this off at a loss and Discovery will have access to a huge lot of movies and shows with large brands. Below you can see the mixture of Discovery brands and Warnermedia brands that are going to be combined under this merger. One item to note is the large number of sports channels that are owned by both companies since there will likely be an offering for live streaming the games or events through the DTC platforms rather than just traditional cable tv channels. One of the great things about Discoverys TV shows is that they do not cost as much as the high-budget WarnerMedia items because of the way that live tv is produced versus scripted TV shows. Also, since these TV shows have already been produced and paid for via the original advertising, both platforms now have the opportunity to sell these brands for a second time without needing to incur any more charges besides the cost of maintaining the platforms. While Netflix has been trying to create their own TV show brands they still license a large portion of their current offering which is why this HBO and Discovery merger is such a big move. One of the great parts of merging the companies is that the subscribers likely wont cannibalize each other due to the difference in content. We will likely see an offering similar to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN where there are combined packages, but also separate offerings in case you only want one product. As of Q3 2021, **Discovery currently reported that they have 20 million subscribers(**[**link**](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/discovery-q3-2021-earnings-warnermedia-streaming-david-zaslav-1235103627/)**) and AT&amp;T reported that HBO and HBO max have 69.4 million subscribers(**[**link**](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hbo-max-q3-2021-subscribers-att-warnermedia-earnings-1235094282/)**).**
* 
* **Financials of the Merger**
   * The first item to note is how the actual deal will work for the shareholders and Discovery &amp; AT&amp;Ts portion of the deal. Discovery will own 29% of the new company while AT&amp;T will own 71% of the new company. Also, DISCA, DISCB, and DISCK will be merged into one set of shares which is why I will be buying the C shares and using the C shares valuation for my numbers. These trade at a discount due to the lack of voting rights.



* Now the economics of the deal have been spelled out and shown via the presentation made in the middle of the year ([link](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_presentations/2021/ATT-Discovery-WM-05172021-FINAL.pdf)). The merger is expected to have \~$52B of revenue and \~$14B of expected EBITDA in 2023(Slide 10). Along with this revenue expectation they are targeting $15B+ of direct-to-consumer revenues in 2023. They expect to have around \~4.5x to \~5x leverage compared to their expected EBITDA. Zaslav recently mentioned that he expects the debt leverage to be around 4.5x ([link](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-zaslav-kevin-mayer-1235103664/)).



* Lastly, the sum of parts valuation presented by The Popular Investor Channel ([link to the explanation](https://youtu.be/4qyFRi51BY4?t=1164)). There are multiple ways to come up with a sum of parts for this evaluation, but I wanted to use Robs video so that new investors can follow along rather than needing to spell it all out here(.....aka I am being lazy). I recreated his sheet on the DCF worksheet if you would like to go in and make your own edits. I think his calculation looks like the correct estimate, but I think the multiple should be 11 while the net debt/EBITDA ratio can be a little higher (This is to be more conservative). I will leave it the same on the sheet so you can see the comparison, but you can clearly see there is a lot of upside on this. You can also use terminal multiples to come to a conclusion if you would rather take a simpler approach.

1,"11/15/2021, 01:50:39",I Analyzed $COIN So You Don't Have To,Jodyhighrolex,"Hello everyone, I recently analyzed $SOFI and $APPS. If you havent seen those posts, feel free to check them out on my profile. An overwhelming majority of the people that commented on them thought they were helpful. Today I will be analyzing $COIN AKA Coinbase. For those that dont know, Coinbase is a company based in America that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Their platform allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrency. At the time of this post, $COIN stock is currently sitting at $342.98. On November 9th they released their earnings report for Q3.

**Important Financial Metrics:**

* They reported revenue of $1.31 Billion which is up 315.9% From the same time last year, but they missed estimates by $270 million.
* Subscription and services revenue was reported to be $145 million in Q3 which is up 41% from Q2.
* Operating expenses were $1.0 billion in Q3 which is a 25% decrease compared to Q2.
* $618 million in EBITDA, which is a 46% drop from last quarter.

**Valuation:** Coinbase is showing very low expected revenue growth and is ranked among the lowest when compared to its competitors, Microstrategy is the only company which is expected to fall behind Coinbase in 2022 and 2023. Coinbase is leading in EBITDA Margins though. Coinbase has the highest EBITDA margins in the industry, surpassing all of their comparable competitors. Furthermore they are trading at reasonable multiples. However, most cryptocurrency exchanges are private so there arent very many great companies to compare them against. Because of this, we cannot give Coinbases EBITDA multiples and revenue much credit.

**Analysis:** This was a very weak quarter for Coinbase, they reported weaker revenue than expected and the number of transacting monthly users dropped from the previous period. They reported 7.4 million monthly transacting users which was a 16% decrease from the previous quarter. Because of the drop in transacting users, Retail transaction revenue for Q3 was $1 billion, which was a decrease of 44% in comparison to Quarter 2.

Somehow Coinbase will have to figure out how to gain more users while charging the highest rates in the industry. Most of the Cryptocurrency traders out there know not to trade on Coinbase since their fees are costly. The company needs to somehow figure out how theyre going to achieve stronger revenue growth so they can elevate their valuations. However, To combat the shortage of revenue and users, Coinbase has been offering new products such as the NFT marketplace, making their company more versatile.

While the company may end up doing well, There is just too much risk with Coinbase since they have competition from exchanges that dont charge as much in fees. I personally do not think Coinbase is a buy. Also, after the latest cryptocurrency bull run, It really is not good at all to see a bad quarter from this company. If you guys have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments below or message me directly. Thanks for reading everyone, Make sure to check out the other write-ups on my profile. Good luck trading!

Please don't forget to upvote if you like the content. I worked hard on it and I want folks who experience trader anxiety to benefit from my work. Over 5000 words, 15 minute read.

**Overview:** For those of you who consider yourself seasoned traders, ignore this... although I promise you that you will learn something. For those of you who have anxiety issues I think this will prove to be an invaluable resource. I'm going to put a lot of time into writing this and it is directed at those who have high amounts of anxiety while trading in the markets.

# Reddit is an Enabler of Trading Anxiety:

Back in the day I used to post a metric ton of highly detailed DD on Reddit. I posted my research on Reddit for a simple reason ... I wanted feedback ... I wanted to crowdsource my DD. One of the primary issues I continued to run into was few, if any, added any substantive value in the comment section. I would post DD and 2-4 weeks later I would get a flood of comments of folks who never commented on the thread before, but nevertheless tanked me for all the money they made as a result of reading and taking action on a ticker I wrote about. It was then I noticed that people on Reddit are frequently looking for justification to throw money at anything that may bring them a return. As it turned out the information I posted provided that justification. But this was not the reason I posted the research. Once again, I wanted to crowd source DD.

I stopped posting DD on Reddit altogether. It was a lot of work for too little feedback. I can do a complete deep dive &amp; workup on a company in my head with a pad and pencil within an hour. Putting it all together and posting the information takes considerably more time. I realized that there is a large segment of people who wanted to be told what to invest in with a detailed summary as to why. They generally want to know  the risks, they want to know the possible rewards, and they wanted to know when to buy in, average down, and sell. I therefore opted instead to publish a daily newsletter instead of positing on Reddit.

People on Reddit are buying what they don't understand with information posted by people they ought not to trust. A great deal of DD on Reddit only comes about when some poor fella is bag holding deep and suddenly realizes that he/she wants to share the amazing value with the world under a misguided understanding that they may be able to generate undue interest in the stock. DD on Reddit is bag holders paradise. DD posts on Reddit nearly always means the author is losing money. Remember more recently when SNAP, WISH, or PTON dumped on very poor earnings? Did you happen to notice all the DD that was posted on those tickers days to weeks after? Those were bag holders folks. In part, their anxiety from their losses led them to the desperation of taking to Reddit to pitch trash.

Reddit is a trash heap of poorly written ""DD"" and bad advice. For every solid bit of analysis found on reddit there are thousands of poorly written items that are neither ""due"" nor ""diligent."" How much ""DD"" have you seen posted, for example, with absolutely no consideration for the risk factors? If they're missing a risk section can we honestly say they're being ""diligent"" ... or are they just trying to pump a stock? And there are plenty of new retail traders who have absolutely no clue what they're doing for these fellas to prey on.

There is a reasons so many new retail traders are taking to Reddit for answers. Reddit has received a lot of attention in the media as a result of the GME/AMC fiasco. So new retail traders see Reddit as a place to look for guidance, but instead of guidance, they end up looking for profit in a sea of bad advice. Many are new to the market, they do not know how to read the financials, they do not know how to assess economic conditions, and they do not know how to read/assess (or even find) 10-K's, 10-Q's, 8-K's, earnings calls, etc... They do not know how to value a company, how to identify entry and exit points, how to assess debt, how to conduct competitive analysis, and some even think technical analysis is all you need. They do not know how to assess trailing PE, forward PE, PB, BVPS, PEG, current ratios, PS, Enterprise Value, GAAP EPS, NON GAAP EPS, operating margin, and the list goes on &amp; on &amp; on. And even if they could somewhat do all of this, they don't have the time. So what's the result? ... Massive amounts of confusion, massive amounts of ignorance, and massive amounts of fear of the unknown.

# Fear of the Unknown is the Number One Reason for Trader Anxiety:

The reason that most of you  suffer from trading anxiety is a lack of confidence in your picks which leads to a great deal of fear of the unknown. And there is only one way to eliminate the fear of the unknown. ELEMINATE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THE UNKNOWN. And if you're are trying to eliminate the unknown through scrolling through insufficient DD posts on Reddit, then your anxiety will likely be amplified when you suddenly find out that most of your trades will fail.

# Eliminating the Unknown will Eliminate Anxiety:

Before I retired, I spent 8 years in the Marines as an Infantryman and 13 years in the Army as an intelligence analyst. I've been on the receiving end of information and the production end of information. I've seen the horrible results of bad information, and the absolutely amazing successes in good information. In my experience analysis should overwhelmingly be risk based. Assessing and mitigating risk in my former line of work meant an increased likelihood of mission success, friendly lives saved, and civilian lives saved. The less risk you assess the higher the threat, and therefore, the higher the anxiety. I approach trading in the same fashion. And I know from experience the largest risks come from the unknowns. Learning to identify and spot those unknowns comes largely from experience but you need to begin somewhere. There are 3 types of unknowns.

* **Known Unknows:** These are the items you know you do not know. The overwhelming amount of your effort when assessing an equity is dedicated to filling in the gaps of those items you know you do not know, but would like to know. And much of it is easy to find, but what if you can't? There are many cases in which you would like to know something but the information is not available. In those cases you look for indicators of the information requirements you need to make your case. Remember, you are both looking for indicators that justify your trade and indicators that do not justify your trade. For example, if you are invested in a gun or ammunition manufacturer, or an outdoors sporting goods store, the FBI's NICS Firearm Background Checks tracker is a damn find indicator. There are hundreds of government indicators and thousands of open source indicators available. You just need to know where to look.
* **Unknown Knowns:** These are things you know, but either forgot you knew, or failed to apply what you knew to your analysis. Perhaps you have solid information to go on, you just didn't thing to use that particular source. To remedy this you simply need to critically think about what you know and how it applies to your analysis. For example, we all know there are websites that check online traffic patterns. Did you ever think to apply this as an indicator for the online retailor you're invested in? I'm willing to bet no!
* **Unknown Unknowns:** This is perhaps the most dangerous, as it is ALMOST completely derived from ignorance. The more ignorant we are on a certain subject matter the more we run into unknown unknowns. Once you've started on your known knowns, identified your known unknowns (and their indicators), assessed your unknown knowns, you draw your attention to the unknown unknowns. Essentially this is asking ""what the hell am I missing and where can I go to find it,"" or ""where can I look to find the things I do not know I'm missing?""

# Eliminating the Unknown and Mitigating Anxiety:

Investing first and researching later is no way to go about business and it can greatly increase your anxiety! The more you know about your company and the current and future economic conditions, the less anxiety you will have. (Note: Much of the data referenced below can be found under the statics tab of any given company on Yahoo Finance. Bottom line is if you know the relative value and prospects of what you own, and the risks thereof, your confidence goes up, and your anxiety drops considerably!

* **Assessing the Known Knowns:** When you begin your analysis you will always start with assessing what you know. You know, that no matter what company you're looking at, you will generally want the following:
   * A forward PE (Price to Earnings) that is lower than the trailing PE, unless you think the market forward PE consensus is wrong.
   * A PE that is relatively lower than sector/industry peers unless you are expecting massive growth.
   * A BV (Book Value) and BVPS (Book Value Per Share) that is closer to the market cap/share price as possible as compared to industry peers.
   * A PS (Price to Sales) ratio of one or less (ideally less than industry/sector peers) of unless, once again, you're expecting massive future growth.
   * A PEG (Price to Earnings Growth) ratio of one or less unless you are pricing in massive growth (Few if any tech companies have a PEG ratio less than one).
   * An enterprise value that is near, or higher than, market cap. Unless, once again, you are expecting massive growth. Companies that have a enterprise value significantly lower than market cap can be possible buyout opportunities.
   * Manageable debt relatively lower than industry peers. (A current ratio above 1 but lower than 5)
   * The company can pay their dividend (see payout ratio)
   * A solid amount of cash on hand.
   * Moderate to high amounts of institutional investment.
   * A solid and growing operating cash flow and operating margin.
   * Increasing YoY Quarterly Revenue Growth and YoY Quarterly EPS Growth.
   * Trading at a value on a pullback of no negative consequence.
   * Solid forward guidance
   * A history of insider confidence through insider buying
   * Solid buy rating analyst coverage and upgrades (Take it with a grain of salt, there are more shitty analysts out there than stars in the sky).
   * Share buybacks are always nice
   * Did you read the most recent 10-K and 10-Q?
   * Did you read the the Risk Factors on the most recent 10-K and 10-Q?
   * Did you read the latest SEC filings?
   * Did you review the last 4 earnings (Seeking Alpha collects them all to include the earnings transcripts under the news section under any given ticker)
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Company:** You can never eliminate all the unknowns about the company. But you can ask yourself the following:
   * Is the company at risk for an offering?
   * Can future revenues cover additional debt and reinvestment?
   * What are the chances the company does not preform as expected?
   * How critical will it be for my investment if the company misses EPS projections? Its an important question to ask. Companies underperform EPS all the time amid earnings. More often than not it means the company is still growing, just not at the rate analysts expected. For most profitable companies, missing EPS projections does NOT mean the company isn't profitable. Companies with a positive EPS should typically be better off this quarter on the books than the previous quarter.
   * Is the company's goals realistic and obtainable?
   * Is the company under or over shooting projected guidance?
   * Are analysts under or over shooting guidance?
   * Is the space the company competes in overcrowded?
   * Is the company losing or gaining market share as compared to competitors?
   * Does the company have a competitive advantage or disadvantage?
   * Is the leadership competent?
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Current and Future Economic Conditions:** This can be tough but at minimum you should study current and upcoming economic datasets and ask how a positive or negative change in the various categories affects your company. You will also want to come up with your own short, medium, and long term projection of economic conditions and how they will affect your company. Always pay attention to the economic calendar!
   * Inflation Rate (Low is good for preventing dramatic shifts in personal spending, high is good for paying off long term debt. Remember if inflation ever gets to a point where people economize on needs and cut back on wants, it can mean bad news for the wants!)
   * Semiconductor Shortage
   * Worker Shortage (Can they meet demand with the workers they got? If not can they beat previous quarters EPS with the workers they got?)
   * Supply Chain Bottlenecks (Check their domestic inventories as a solid indicator of how affected they are by this)
   * Rising fuel and Energy Costs
   * Rising Shipping Costs
   * Government &amp; Regulatory Environment
   * Federal Reserve Policy
   * Reliance on China and Chinese Economic/Regulatory Environment
   * Unemployment Rate and Labor Force Participation Rate (Too high less people are buying, too low and the cost of labor goes up)
   * Always Pay Close Attention to the ECONOMIC CALANDER and the results reported!

# Perspective and Expectation Management Also Mitigates Anxiety:

It's gonna go to the moooooon!!!! No it isn't! Read my part on Big money below to find out why. It's important that you have reasonable expectations. It's important that you have a decent and realistic perspective on the outcome of your trade. Doing this will go leaps and bounds toward mitigating your anxiety.

* **There is NO Such thing as a Perfect Stock:**  If your anxiety is so through the roof that you're forgoing great trades on good companies, cut that shit out! There is no such thing as a perfect stock and you will always need to accept a certain degree of risk!
* **Do not Sweat Minor Misses in EPS:** You're company barely missed analysts EPS or Revenue Expectations? So what!!?? Are they profitable? Are they growing? If they had positive revenue and EPS, chances are they're still growing on the books. Sure their rate of growth may have changed but they're adding money to the balance sheet! It would be one thing if they lowered guidance, but short of that a small EPS miss isn't nothing to frown upon and might put you in the position to buy some more stock for a cheaper price on a really good company! If holding a little longer gives you anxiety then its because you're attempting to get money quick by swinging trades, which is fine, but can add an additional layer of anxiety. I love it when companies miss small but stand by their guidance. The street has a fit as the share price sells off, affording me the chance to enter in.
* **Expect the Unexpected and Have a Plan:** Black Swans happen. Major unexpected economic shifts happen. Your dry bulk carrier will catch fire or lose their cargo in the ocean. Oil companies will have spills. Companies get sued all the time. Adjusted economic numbers come out every day of the week. Your stock WILL NOT trade as everyone expects it to. Get used to this and you will mitigate your anxiety. Buy in slowly and have a plan, and you will mitigate it even more.
* **Analysts are Always Wrong:** Firstly it is important to understand that analyst price targets are where the analyst expects the stock to be in a year or so. Not right now. I see a lot of retail traders complaining about the company share price not being at the analyst price target. Its ridiculous expectation management! And unnecessary anxiety.
* **Understand how Big Money Operates and Expect their Antics!:**  When large institutions dealing in millions to billions of dollars decide to buy or sell a stock, they are well aware that they will inevitably move the share price. The volume they create can be massive. To mitigate this they will either sell calls or buy puts when they sell a considerable lot of shares, or buy calls or sell puts when they buy a considerable lot of shares. Therefore it is important to understand that institutions can often make money no matter which way the stock trades. Unlike most retail traders they even have the option to go both long &amp; short on the same security at the same time. They can, &amp; do, often go short to take advantage of the bearish sentiment they inevitably create while selling large blocks of shares while locking in their profit using a combination of options strategies. Always remember that retail does not own the market  big money does. This reality forces us to come to grips with the necessity not to fight them, but to ride their backs. This includes having the discipline &amp; courage of our convictions to hold through the bearish sentiment institutions inevitably create, on perfectly good companies, when some big firm takes profit. Consider retail traders like ourselves the small Remora Fish attached to a large Great White Shark (The Institutions), waiting to ride their backs out of but a temporary rut of no true consequence.
* **Trading Psychology:** Psychology plays a large part of why stocks can continue to trade below street value (The value most traders believe fair). Once a stock sells off due to large institutional profit taking, the street wonders why. Does someone know something we dont? Was there some economic data that cast bearish sentiment on this particular industry or sector? Does the street expect the company to act in a way that will lower its valuation? Such questions, &amp; many more, arent just asked by us. Theyre asked by everyone who holds a position in the company we do. And these questions cause anxiety. Even analysts may downgrade a stock for no other reason than to tailor their expectations a year out from now. Indeed they hate to be wrong, &amp; they always are. So do not be surprised not only when a security we thought was already undervalued sells off further than expected, but also stays down as it may take time for traders to feel comfortable entering again. Corrections back to street value can often take a few weeks to a few months. Sometimes until next earnings to relive fears of both retail &amp; large institutions.

# Processes Mitigate Anxiety:

Processes mitigate anxiety. The more efficient the process the less time you spend searching for places to put that money that's burning a hole in your pocket. Some traders feel as though they are in a rush to hurry up and strike while the iron is hot and put their money somewhere only to find out that  they rushed their trades and realized a loss. Below is my process and a few additional pointers for researching equities and it mitigates A LOT of my personal trader anxiety.

1. **Assess the Economic Conditions First!:** Assessing the economic conditions first grants you the opportunity to single out those sectors that stand to benefit the most from current and future economic conditions. If you do not know how to do this please see an earlier post I made on this very topic HERE. Also investing in companies that stand to benefit the most from economic conditions gives you an extra layer of confidence to fight anxiety.
2. **Make a Price Based Assessment Watchlist and Set your Alerts:** A Price Based Assessment Watchlist is simply adding companies that you've 1. Assessed the Current or Future Economic Conditions as Favorable. 2. Did a Quick Review of the Company Financials. 3. Set your alert at your desired reassessment price. ONLY when that alert hits is when you do the rest of your research and DD. That way you ONLY use your valuable time on the most promising of circumstances. That way you aren't frantically searching and scrolling for plays, but letting the plays come to you, which helps with anxiety!
3. **Buy on a Pullback of Little to No Negative Consequence:** I love a good dump. Perhaps it comes from a bad market day, perhaps it comes from the sector in general doing poorly that day, and perhaps it comes from a whale taking profit. I don't care. If the financials are great, I expect the company to grow, and the economic conditions are favorable, such a pullback will trigger my buy alerts letting me know its time for a starter position. But first I do a quick assessment to see if there is any recent negative news that is driving down the share price. If there is negative news, I ask myself to what degree is the news of legitimate financial substance to the growth prospects of the company. If very little, I'll be happy to buy that dip. Some would argue that they want to jump in on solid relative strength. Yeah ... they're chasing and I don't chase. I like it when its cold, not when its hot. Later, when my thesis becomes true, then it gets hot and I watch everyone else chase. But buying on a pullback of little to no consequence will give you that extra layer of value and security you may have been looking for. You wont be worried if the security is over pumped and about to fall, but rather patiently waiting for it to pump again. I think the latter of the two holds less anxiety. More profitable too!
4. **Keep Track of the News:** If you want to monitor your investments stop looking at the chart and read all the news that comes out on your company. Two good places to do this are seeking alpha (Put the ticker in and click the news tab) and, believe it or not, StockTwits! The bots and the news scroller on StockTwits are money! Ignore the people there, read the news scroller!
5. **Set Price Alerts on Current Positions:** Set price alerts at 5% above or below your starter position price. Its a lot more easy to go about your day that way, and waaay less anxiety when you can be rest assured that at minimum your investment has not pumped or lost 5%. If your stock does dump 5% and you get alerted, perhaps then you might want to check for bad news and average down as necessary. Otherwise leave it be!

# Anxiety Mitigating Rules to Live by:

Some added anxiety killing tips!

* **If you aren't willing to hold the stock long term, stay away from it!:** So you think you're going to swing it real quick and get out so you don't need to put too much effort into the trade? Think again. The technical analysis wizard on YouTube may have a pretty technical set up, but he's going to throw your anxiety through the roof. And only IF you're lucky, you MAY make a profit.
* **Quit Checking your Phone, Set Alerts Instead:** Set share price points where you want to be alerted and quit checking your phone. I promise you that your anxiety is really going to increase when you're fired from work because you spend too much time checking your investments and too little time getting anything done.
* **Stay Away from Risky Options Strategies:** So you wanted to get rich quick so you bough a bunch of naked calls or puts? All or nothing baby!! Well there goes your anxiety. The more professional you are with options the less anxiety you'll have.
* **Be a Net Options Seller:** Covered calls while you're waiting for your position to turn over long periods of time is a great idea. Its like getting a free dividend and it lowers your cost basis. I've been selling AMMO Inc calls for the last three months and in addition to profiting from the increase in share price, I've cashed in $0.56 in premium per share, a 9% gain on the overall position on options premium alone. At this point I don't care how the stock trades. Talk about low anxiety huh? I'll sell calls till the cows come home and if the shareprice on the last day before expiry is slightly over the strike on the calls I sold, pending I want to hold on to the shares I'll just roll the options to another month for additional premium. Furthermore when I can't get a stock for the price I want I often just sell an in the money cash secured put if the options premium is worth it. Lets say a stock is trading for $6.00 but the $7.50 strike put is trading for $2.70. That means the real price to me if assigned is $4.80 per share. Talk about a steal! I'll sell that contract all day every day! And with practically no anxiety on a solid company!
* **Don't buy in all at once, do NOT chase!:** Don't just throw in a full allocation all at once on a stock. Rather establish a starter position and buy in slowly in the red. This will greatly lower your cost average and increase your profitability. For example, if you established a starter position but now you find yourself down 5%, you can just buy an equally sized position and now you only need the stock to increase 2.5% to recover from your loss. Does this help with your anxiety? You bet it does! Finally, if the stock skyrockets don't chase it. Enjoy the profit and move on. Chasing has been the windowmaker of plenty of traders ... particularly in the penny stock world.
* **Keep 25-50% Cash to the Side:** Sure it limits your profit, but it can also enhance your profit too. Especially amid uncertain times. The market will never react the way you think it will and it is important to keep some cash to the side in the event the market turns sour. And imagine the amount of anxiety you save by knowing in the long run you can not only double down on a good company, but you can profit more as well. Lets say the stock you're in dipped 25% on a market panic. Well if you bought a reliably profitable company you will eventually recover. But if you used that cash to the side to double down you'll only need to wait until the stock rebounds 12.5%. By the time the stock recovers 25% you'll have made 12.5% profit.
* **Margin is for Emergencies:** Margin for small retail traders should strictly be used for emergencies. One such emergency for me was the big COVID dump. Sure I made some decent money shorting DIS but that alone did not make up my losses. I also had some cash to the side. And I bought the dip. Much to my surprise however the market kept dipping. I took out 25% leverage on my marginable positions. Because I had cash to the side and I saved margin only for emergencies, I was able to profit big from the rebound.
* **Stay away from unprofitable companies and Penny Stocks:** This speaks for itself. I have analyzed a the risk on a bunch of penstocks. And unprofitable companies can often disappoint. Indeed the volatility is there, and there is profit to be made amid volatility. However trust me when I tell you that if you are reading this, it means you likely need help in your trading habits, and you should just stay away from penny stocks and unprofitable companies.
* **If You go Short, Consider Buying a Call:** If you're short, you can lose a lot of money if the trade turns against you. But by buying an at the money call when yo go short on 100 shares, you have the same effect of buying a put when you're long. The max you can lose if you're short and you bought an at the money call, is the price of the call and perhaps just a little bit more in some circumstances. The price of a stock can literally go from $10 to $1000, but still, if you bought a call, your losses are capped at the strike of the call plus premium. You wont even need to cover. When the call is assigned it will automatically cover the play for you. And if the price dips low enough to the point you received enough profit to cover the cost of the call and a little more, you can cover the stock and if you so choose to hold on to the call option, it's paid for! Its a free call. You can sell it if you wish, or hold it as a lotto. But either way you're anxiety is reduced because you can only lose so much on your short position! This is why I laugh when people say ""shorts are scared."" Big money ALWAYS hedges their short position. They cant stand the anxiety of a naked short and neither should you!
* **So You're Down 5%? Who Cares?:** 5% is nothing but a great place to average down. You did your DD, you've assessed the economic conditions, plenty of institutions are satisfied with the stock, what have you got to worry about? Expect this and let it in to your way of life. It's going to happen. Just average down with the money you have to the side and hold. They will continue to make money quarter after quarter which will increase their book value which will eventually get realized by upward price momentum.
* **BUY RELIABLY RPOFITABLE COMPANIES PRIMED FOR GROWTH, TRADING AT A SECTOR RELATIVE VALUE, ON A PULLBACK OF NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE, WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT, UNDER FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS!:** Swing for grand slams and you'll strike out, or ground out nearly every time. Swing for base hits and you'll hit base hits, home runs, and grand slams on a very regular basis!

# You will NEVER Get Rid of All of your Anxiety:

Its got to be said! You will never get rid of all of your anxiety. You just put a significant amount of cash you worked hard for into shares of a company subject to both positive and negative market forces. There will always be unknowns. Therefore, there will always be anxiety.

**TL;DR:** First, I HIGHLY suggest you read this if you feel that you are the target audience. The thesis above speaks to the fact that anxiety in trading largely comes from the unknown, &amp; the more you mitigate the unknown the less anxiety you will experience. Above there are plenty of steps you can do to mitigate the unknown, thereby developing your confidence, and become a more profitable trader. I also argue that you can mitigate a large portion of your anxiety simply by understanding what you're buying in an equity, understand the markets, understanding trading techniques, developing a sense of perspective, and buying ""*reliably profitable companies, primed for growth, trading a sector relative value, on pullback of little to no negative consequence, with a decent amount of institutional investment, under favorable economic conditions.*"" This post is for people serious about mitigating their anxiety and learning how to trade in a manner that will benefit both their mental health and their wallets. In summary, if traders respect their own money and do what they're supposed to do, it will go a long way to mitigating anxiety.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtuqjf/mitigating_trader_anxiety_how_to_trade_like_your/

1,"11/15/2021, 01:01:19","Microvast ( $MVST ) - Earnings Setup For Tomorrow Monday November 14, 2021",SCHNiiiiKEN,"OK all you retards.  I hope that many of you have been following my posts on Microvast DD, because the time has finally come and tomorrow is the day that we have been waiting for.  Tomorrow, Monday November 14, 2021 is quarterly earnings and anticipation for beating is high.  As some of you may know, last quarter they missed and guided down.  I would anticipate that when they took the hit last quarter they guided down enough to make sure they could beat this quarter.  On top of that, if you look at lot's of DD posted on this company there are tons of partnerships, customers, R&amp;D, and other updates expected.  

Now a couple of updates that have developed late last week:

* The Tutes have started piling into Microvast check out these latest buys.   
 

[Tute ownership way up since 09\/26\/21](https://preview.redd.it/5t9ww7pxalz71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98994cdc21a7f25ed2cf31a49ab58fd3a42c86ff)

* As some of you may know from my previous posts the free tradable float of MVST is around 27 million, and the S1 still has not been made effective.  This means that they need to re-file the S1 with the updated quarterly information that is coming out in this earnings release.  They can no longer make the existing S1 amendment effective. This means it will delay the S1 effectiveness much further than anyone imagined!  It means we have 27-28 million free tradable float for quite a while now.
* I did an analysis on the latest holding information from the Bloomberg terminal (which is most up to date and dependable)  I believe if the 27-28 million tradeable float (denominator) is correct, then 22,130,687 or about 79%!!!!!!!! of the shares are held by tutes.  I just completed this analysis based on latest holdings information on the Bloomberg... including the latest large tute buys weve seen.  Here's my math to check (i knocked out shared from the third column where it was S1, or Form 4):   


[Holding information on Microvast MVST from Bloomberg - Removing S1, Proxy, and Form 4 holdings \(insider\) totals up third column to 22 million shares held by Tutes as of the latest data.](https://preview.redd.it/hcapafzgblz71.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b6b3b324cf84d9b701a8617501c6dfe74973fb)

* The technicals for exploding are lined up properly as well if earnings beat, or any news that we are anticipating is released.  The company is planning on having an online webinar for earnings, and last quarter they did not have a webinar - sounds like they've got something they want to discuss, and they are taking question from retail, with a cool #askmicrovast tag on Twitter.  Lots of great questions have been posed, and they will answer the ones they deem best (should be exciting!)

[If we just get a little volume here with all the short interest and the setup we are primed for some upwards movement!](https://preview.redd.it/7xq2gwuiclz71.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500400189801a20cdb582f881004bf56d4a1fed6)

* The short interest is through the roof, at all time highs and the days to cover (between 8-11) and borrow rates are insane (above 150%)

1,"11/15/2021, 00:49:45",Potential Short-Squeeze in $DQ (supercheap polysilicon producer),enhanced_investments,"**DAQO New Energy** \- supercheap traded in US Chinese Polysilicon Producer

With Market Cap of $5.3bn **it is traded 4x times cheaper** than its Chinese subsidiary Xinjang Daqo (MCap $22bn)

**Recently it published a super-strong report**: Revenue +365 YoY, EBITDA +750% YoY, cash position $1.5 bn with no interest-bearing loans. It's traded at just 4.8x EV/LTM EBITDA, 2.9x EV/LTM EBITDA; due to the energy crisis polysilicon prices continue to climb (now $38 vs $18 average in last twelve months).

The disbalance is due to the fact that the company was put on the US administration entities list (almost all the Chinese polysilicon producers were put on it due to **forced labor allegations**) - DAQO cannot be supplied software or technologies, but their shares still can be traded on US exchanges

My personal view is that

**the company will grow large anyway** \- US accounts for just 12% of global solar capacity; while China accounts for &gt; 50% of polysilicon production; China is planning to raise solar and wind capacity to 12 000 GW by 2030 from the current 500 GW

**allegations might be exaggerated** \- polysilicon production is a difficult chemical process, and the share of labor in expenses is small; the company would probably avoid it to increase MCap 4x times if it was true

In my view, all the US investors who felt that they have to leave the position already did so, and now the share price is moving towards fair values.

Despite superstrong fundamentals, some twitter fund managers,   publish almost every day negative info about the company - I think because they short the stock.

With the company cash balance and large insider ownership, it can arrange shares buyback leading to short-squeeze of the shorter above.

Until this point, nothing to suprising from my perspective of things.

 Then there is a established player in the hydrogen market, which is Nel Asa. They are on a very good way to strengthen their position in H2 market for the future, cause they have all the necessary skills and products for the incoming green hydrogen hype (this is my guess, please inform yourself). Well, competition is hard in this game, but I am wondering about the short interest rate for the NEL ASA stock. 

Look for yourself, we're sitting at around ~8% short positions. 

Source: https://shortnordic.com/detaljer_selskap.php?company=NEL&amp;land=Norway 

So we have a quite good potential, that NEL will prosper through the next years (long). 
Furthermore there is also good chance, that with the power of the bulls, we can kill this institutional shortys - with no vision for a better human society - in the short term. 

What are your thoughts, especially with you guys having experience with situations like this. Why are there so many short positions and is there a high potential for the short and long term apes around here to make some good profit?

1,"11/12/2021, 23:52:01","$TTCF delayed earnings, consider PUTS now",Academic-Lake,"Hello fellow degenerates, I wanted to make a quick DD on why lotto puts on TTCF might print. 

First of all, what does TTCF do? Well, TTCF is Tattooed Chef, Inc, and makes fairly premium vegan and vegetarian ready-made products and meal kits. The company was founded in 2018 and went public via SPAC merger last year, not exactly sure when, doesn't matter. What matters is why I think that they will miss earnings and guide downwards. 

1. Supply chain difficulties: have you been living under a fucking rock? bare shelves happen for a reason. shortages may cause the company to not have enough raw materials to manufacture enough products to satisfy demand, even (big IF) demand persists.
2. Rising raw material (food), shipping, and labour costs: all three of these factors eat into TTCF's margins. Produce prices are up across the board, and so are shipping costs for TTCF's direct to consumer business.
3. Flat growth due to dying hype in the vegan food sector: Look at $BYND. Trading at 52w lows after disappointing earnings. The fact is that the vegan food space, while growing, is becoming increasingly competitive and crowded, and investors will get cold feet as soon as these overvalued and unprofitable companies aren't able to report blowout growth.
4. Stands to lose as the economy reopens: we've seen several COVID plays go pop in the past few weeks - I think this will be no different. People are going back to the office and into restaurants, so the demand for meal kits will decrease. 
5. Price action: strong selloff on 50% of average 10 day volume. High volume selling is never a good thing, does not show investor confidence.

Finally, the company delayed earnings. Originally, they were supposed to report yesterday PM but have since rescheduled to an unspecified date. SEC regulations stipulate that they must file their 10Qs within 45 days of the quarter ending, so they must report during next week. Companies rarely reschedule earnings for good reasons... investopedia suggests that reasons for rescheduling earnings could be audits, incompetency from directors, or the accidental destruction of financial data. Not good! The mattress company (which is now banned for being under (1b) also rescheduled earnings and we remember how that went. My puts printed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Certain older SPAC plays like PSFE or the mattress company haven't been too hot recently either.

&amp;#x200B;

Risk factors: stock is already at 52w lows. Everything I said may be wrong. Company doesn't report next week for some reason. Etc. 

Positions: 10x TTCF  11/19 16p at 0.65

Disclaimer: I am a retard. This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Please contact a certified financial advisor for investment advice. Always do your own research. I own a position that would benefit from TTCF's share price decreasing, hence, I am biased. Entertainment purposes only.

Let's go ape, who are with me?                  -Analysts lowered price targets on Pay-safe (NYSE: PSFE) following Q3 miss and slashed FY21 outlook.

RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin lowered PT to $9 from $15, implying a 112.3% upside, and maintained an Outperform.

The analyst notes that the company's Q3 and guidance were ""disappointing"" as Paysafe's Digital Wallet segment has come under pressure from open banking/direct to bank apps in Europe, creating substitute goods for its ""core wallet,"" resulting in some share loss.

Regulation in Germany and Holland, two key markets, makes gaming operators more challenging to profit while limiting the number of licenses available.

The analyst also argues that pricing needs to be reset in certain markets/tiers to be more competitive.

Cowen analyst George Mihalos downgraded Paysafe to Market Perform from Outperform with a PT of $7, down from $14, implying a 65.1% upside.

The analyst cites its 2021 guidance cut driven by the weaker trends across its Digital Wallet business, which is its ""most differentiated and higher-value offering.""

Mihalos adds that a turnaround in the segment, which is being impacted by both regulatory and internal factors, will take time until late 2022 at the earliest and limit the upside on the stock.

Evercore ISI analyst David Togut downgraded Paysafe to in-line with Outperform with a $4 price target, implying a 5.7% downside.

Credit Suisse analyst Timothy Chiodo lowered the price target to $4 from $9 and kept a Neutral rating.

Paysafe's updated 2022 outlook calls for revenue and EBITDA roughly 10%-13% and 22%-25% below prior Street expectations, respectively, Chiodo notes.

The headwinds are most pronounced within the Digital Wallets segment, a segment that had a leadership change during Q3 and had introduced risk associated with the previously guided outlook, the analyst adds",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsdzlf/psfe_the_shorts_do_what_they_want_they_feel_like/

Never mind that I'm addicted to coffee worse than a heroine addict shooting behind a Wendys. Yes, coffee is such a boring commodity that has remained stagnant for decades. The majority of sales is currently driven by growers instead of manufacturers, which brings to the following statistics.

 

Some 2020 statistics

* In 2020, top Coffee producers generated over $2B in sales. 
* Us Coffee market is comprised of a handful of growers with Folgers leading in revenue by $1B.
* Starbucks is a distant second with $500M
*  Popularity of single cup brewing machines has soared by nearly 50% in  the last five years. Americans are 24% less likely than in 2015 to  prepare their coffee in a traditional drip coffee maker. 
* 90% of coffee drinkers drink coffee at home
* 67% of coffee drinkers buy coffee at supermarket

&amp;#x200B;

[Coffee drinkers are older, hence have more discretionary income to purchase equipment!](https://preview.redd.it/ysko3tn3l6z71.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ade3a48979d1c5b10bc89cee65ed8dcc579301a)

Having laid out those statistics, I want to draw attention to consumer behavior because the vast majority drink their hot brews at home. According to statistics, 90% drink at home, which means the need for equipment.

Enter  NuZee (ticker Nuze)

Nuze is in the cutting edge of innovation with its Cuvee Coffee machine, which uses single serve filter bags. Their production efficiencies will be disrupting the market as they have made an affordable quality machine with an ease-of-access feature that was previously exclusive to expensive units.

Nuze has heavily been promoting its new units to distributors.  Recently (yesterday), it announced a large contract order with Wall-mart, which will increase sales dramatically. Another interesting fact was yesterday's volume which exceeded 108M (or 50x its daily volume), which comes to about 1/5 the number of o. shares. Finally, I'd like to point to NuZee's 3Q financials, which NUZee was able to improve from its 2nd and 1st quarter (from .40 to .17 loss). 

I believe the aggressive distribution channel ramp, which landed its Wall-mart contract has made NuZee a value play!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsdczj/dd_on_why_nuzee_is_going_past_uranus/

Salutations fellow ape family this is my first fundamental analysis drop, my ape family has inspired me to share my knowledge with you all. If I am successful I want to share my insights with my ape family.

With that being said welcome to my ted talk, there has been a lot going on during the pandemic and there are a lot of ways to profit; I myself am a poor smooth brained autist but this ape has seen some light. There have been some serious discussions about people refusing to take the vaccine and individuals looking for alternatives there is a divide amongst Americans whether or not to take the COVID vaccine. With all do respect everyone has the right to make a choice to live or die based off whatever they believe. I as an engineer see a problem and look for a solution, and this is what any scientist would do and of course look for a profit based off peoples wants and needs. So I introduce to you all Viatris (VTRS). VTRS was formerly known as Mylan N.V. was a global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company. In November 2020, Mylan merged with Upjohn, Pfizer's off-patent medicine division, to form Viatris. Viatris, Inc. is a global healthcare company, which engages in the provision of access to medicines, sustainable operations. It also offers support services such as diagnostic clinics, educational seminars, and digital tools. The firm operates through the following segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets. The Developed Markets segment comprises operations primarily in North America and Europe. The Greater China segment includes operations in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The JANZ segment consists of operations in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The Emerging Markets segment encompasses operations with developing markets and emerging economies including countries in Asia, the Middle East, South and Central America, Africa and Eastern Europe. Okay so basically this company is all around the fucking world fellow apes so why the fook am I making such a Donkey Kong big deal

Well Im here for you  brethren to connect some motherfookin tendies to all yall. Okay so just recently Pfizer (PFE) has come out with a COVID pill an antiviral that cuts the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for vulnerable people newly diagnosed with COVID-19. The news I am presenting to you my family is big we are slowly connecting the dots here bear with  me, I do hope you are enjoying the read though I love you all.

I have linked supporting articles that explain more about the pill I will allow you apes to dig deeper for yourselves

Alright lets start connecting these dots so VTRS operates all around the world literally all around the fookin world, PFE made a pill to treat COVID and VTRS operates all around the world, for those who are unwilling to take a vaccine to save their lives they can simply take a pill are you apes connecting the dots with me. So if PFE makes a pill what better way to distribute this pill than with VTRS since it already operates all around the world. Yeah thats right you heard correctly PFE researches the pill VTRS distributes the pill for PFE. I hope this makes sense to you all I encourage you all to do your own research too. Me right now Im too broke to purchase stock, this shit is way too pricy for my taste. Right now VTRS is trading at $14.56 a share yeah too expensive for my taste, but you know what is not expensive the buy call options yeah, if I got to learn anything from DeepFuckingValue is that theta decay (time) is either your friend or your enemy. What do I mean you need time for your crop to bear fruit. So what do you think the value of VTRS could be personally I think it is way undervalued. Yes 14.56 well for me anyways is a lot personally but I believe this shit is going to moon hard. I try to look for the biggest bang for my buck right now you can get a contract that expires Jan 2023 for 10 a share thats $10 for a lot meaning 100 shares. 100 contracts for $1,000 isnt a bad deal. Personally I cant afford that many but I was able to pick up a quarter of the amount. PFE is trading at about $50 a share at the moment it will probably go to the moon too. But I cant afford that shit either but I can afford the distributor. I mean to put things into perspective Moderna MRNA was one of the first ones to get approval for a vaccine and the stock went from $20 a share to $450. Okay now lets look at short interest apes lets look under the hood of this baby, Im using marketbeat it is identified on 10/15/2021 the short interest was at 28,450,000 shares this represents

$17,480,000,000 (market  cap)/$14.56(share price) = 1200549450.55 (available shares)

28,450,000 (SI) /1200549450.55  (available shares) = 0.02369748283 (SI of float)

0.02369748283 (SI of float) \* 100 = 2.369% (SI of float percentage)

The short interest low and personally, I think a short on this stock is an attack not only nefarious but an attack on all human kind.

&amp;#x200B;

If we take a  look at the companys history we can see that it is at historical all time lows which for me this presents a perfect opportunity to capitalize on all time lows for an opportunity to make gains on historical all time highs because of PFEs revolutionary COVID pill.

My personal opinion take it for a grain of salt; PFE and VTRS will do the same rocket hard. If you dont want a vaccine fine take a pill.

TL;DR

VTRS go moon; options contracts inexpensive

Options Contracts selling for 10 a lot for expiry of Jan 2023

I hate being poor

Zacks said a few days ago that they don't expect a surprise, but even the expected small miss will be a 66% increase in earnings on a 200% increase in revenue, so it's not like the company is treading water.

So lots of people watching, almost no analyst coverage, lots of exciting businesses like wireless charging, electric trucks, electric tractors and electric motorcycle, and a mountain of near-the-money calls.

1,"11/12/2021, 22:40:31",Fight Big Tech,dominion124,"I remember years ago when Apple took Microsoft to court and won because of Microsoft's unfair practices. Such unfair practices still continue today as Big Tech looks to crush any competition. One of the worse offenders is Facebook (Meta). It has extended it's tentacles into so many areas in an effort to squeeze the life out of any competition.

We need a healthy economy which fosters competition and not supremacy by the big players.

That's why I'm calling attention to Vuzix corporation. The metaverse is the next step in the advancement of social media. And a leader in the technology is Vuzix corporation. But the monopoly of Big Tech threatens to crush the company. 

It's well worth the time spent in looking into companies like Vuzix. And after seeing potential in such companies we should throw our weight behind them in the fight against the monopolies that are trying to run them under.

1,"11/12/2021, 22:19:20",What are your investing lessons learned on your YOLO journey? I'll add the most upvoted ones to this post for future Degen reference!,LeonardoDiYolio,"I started in 2020 with $200k and in true WSB fashion, lost 50% on YOLOs and ADHD-driven investing tactics which made absolutely no sense. Thankfully, I've recouped those losses. And as crazy as it sounds, I am grateful for my rough start because, to truly become great traders, we must all learn to lose and, subsequently, learn from losing first. 

**What lessons have you learned that you would like to share? I'll add them to this post for future WSB Degen autist reference. Here are some of mine; I'll remove/edit as demanded- simply comment and upvote on the changes.**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Don't buy weekly options at market open; implied volatility is typically at its highest at open.
2. Don't hold weekly options overnight; theta decay is magnified on weekly options.
3. Don't buy OTM weekly options (FD's); ATM weeklies have higher chances at returns.
4. Wait at least 5 minutes (preferably 15 minutes) after markets open to buy/short equities; volatility is typically highest at open.
5. Don't trade against the trend; the trend is like a wave, surf the damn thing instead.
6. Don't discount the macro market trend; you may feel bullish about a stock in a down market, but the macro environment will likely always win. (a rising tide lifts all boats, and vice versa) 
7. Don't yolo into a stock simply based on a stranger's DD on the internet; do your own DD as well, even if just minimal DD.
8. Don't go chasing earnings unless you've done your DD; this market is highly irrational; nowadays, great earnings results and forward looking guidance typically result in selloffs.
9. Don't buy weekly options within 48 hours of any earnings release; implied volatility increases as earnings day approaches which limits/impacts any upside gain. 
10. Indicators are your friend, but they are not gospel (especially in high volatility periods); I've been led astray by RSI and EMA crossing several times.
11. Don't just trade on 1M or 5M charts; 30M and 1D charts are great for trend verification. 
12. Manage your risk on each trade; before entering, determine how much you are willing to lose and either place a stop loss limit order or follow the price action closely until you close your position. 
13. NEVER invest more than you are willing to lose and definitely not everything in your portfolio at once unless you can stomach the loss.

1,"11/12/2021, 22:13:19",50/50 trading day what does it tell us  11/12/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY.,jmj_daytrader," 

Goodmorning traders, each morning I come in and take information from yesterdays close and assimilate what could possible happen today. Today will be harder than most and I will give brief look as to why with getting toocomplicated. Standard deviation plays a big part in any pricing model. It has a part in everything around us especially stock and option theoretics. To jump to the jest of it, in statistics the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. The higher the deviation the bigger the range the lower the deviation the smaller the range. we can view this graphically by using a bell curve. By turning the bell curve on it side we get a statistical measure of possible price movement. 68.2% of transaction like to take place around this (green area around the mean) If we close in the yellow, we have about an 85 to 86% chance of reverting to the mean. But what happens when you close at the mean? It gives you absolutely no bias either way. And this is where we close yesterday at the mean. So today we need to be prepared for every situation. 

Today's scenarios...   Video outlook below in comments 

In a crazy range day, there are so many ways it could go so I have to give you the basis of how things could go but the path is so hard to predict. On most range days we establish a low and establish a high and we ping pong back and forth between the two. There are several variations to the range day structure. A range day with a bullish bias, range day with a bearish bias. But today there is a Squeeze element in this structure. Which means we are setting up to break out of a range.

1)Crazy Range Day structure. We find the 1strange high around 465 area. From here we may try to find our 1strange low which could be around 463 area.

Also  their earnings have been higher than expected and they are looking  forward to quickly solve their issue with the FDA from late october.

Could  bring a easy profit of about 100% if  it goes back up to 16$ like BBBY did when it filled the gap.

*****

#[Dow futures up nearly 100 points after J&amp;J shares pop on split news](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/stock-futures-inch-higher-as-wall-street-looks-to-avoid-losing-week-amid-high-inflation.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures moved slightly higher early Friday morning as Wall Street looked to end the week on a positive note after a historic inflation report.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 90 points. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Dow component Johnson &amp; Johnson saw its shares pop about 3% in premarket trading following a Wall Street Journal report that the company is splitting in two. Johnson &amp; Johnson is reportedly breaking off its consumer health division into a separate publicly-traded company.
*****
&gt; The move in futures comes after the stock market appears to have withstood the hottest inflation report in 30 years on Wednesday. The major indexes are on track to snap five-week winning streaks but are still within striking distance of their recent records.
*****
&gt; Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that year-over-year comparisons to an abnormal 2020 and rising wages may have dented the reaction to the inflation report.
*****
&gt; Big numbers get big headlines, and yes prices are higher, but youve got also wage increases that are just about to the same amount as inflation is. So inflation is definitely real, but the impact isnt quite as severe as people think, Frederick said.
*****
&gt; The inflation report was the latest complication from economic data that investors have sorted through in recent weeks, with some professional investors looking optimistically toward 2022.
*****
&gt; Weve probably reached maximum supply chain disruption and I think the labor market is going to free up a bit as we saw with the jobs report last Friday, said Brent Schutte, the chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual.
*****
&gt; This week has seen more dramatic action in the bond market, where the inflation report led to a sharp reversal from the recent decline in the 10-year Treasury yield on Wednesday. The bond market was closed on Thursday for Veterans Day.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 edged slightly higher. The Dow dropped nearly 160 points, dragged down by Disneys post-earnings slide.
*****
&gt; Through Thursday, the Dow is down 1.1% for the week, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are down 1% and 1.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; After a busy week of earnings and economic data releases, Friday is relatively light for investors. The preliminary read for November consumer sentiment and the September report on job openings and labor turnover will be released Friday morning.

I tried posting these two article summaries of mine to WSB several days ago but was denied. It is about the growing momentum for the legalization of marijuana.

TLRY, CGC, and many other pot complex stocks are moving. SNDL is up 40% premarket this morning. Long dated calls a year out, which were very cheap,  would have printed on these. Is it too late? I'll leave that to up to the community of degenerates to decide. 

[Mexico looks to be going legal here soon.](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/top-mexican-senator-blames-u-s-for-marijuana-criminalization-ahead-of-legalization-vote-expected-next-month/) which may put some pressure on the US. 

Call you senators and congressman and get them to vote on this. Or buy in, then call them:)

1,"11/12/2021, 21:36:23",Cannabis / WeedSqueeze is here $MSOS - mods please let me post!,indedey,"New to the sub, I have not posted DD before, but I think cannabis is about to squeeze. 

$MSOS is now over $1b in Assets under management, an ETF listed on the NYSE and is a basket of US Based Cannabis Companies that are not Federally Compliant and therefore ineligible for US stock exchanges and traded on OTC in US and CSE. These stocks are some of the most shorted on the CSE, some with dark pool volumes over 50% short

For those not familiar with Cannabis, companies have been beat up this year. Senators Schumer and Booker have sandbagged SAFE Banking since it is not broad enough and doesnt deschedule cannabis, only allows banking.

[https://www.marijuanamoment.net/cory-booker-vows-to-block-marijuana-banking-until-senate-passes-comprehensive-legalization/](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/cory-booker-vows-to-block-marijuana-banking-until-senate-passes-comprehensive-legalization/)

As a result, the MSO stocks have been relegated to the Canadian Securities Exchange, trading in the US on OTC. For example, Green Thumb Industries is trading CSE: GTII and on US OTC GTBIF. The US institutions cannot hold these stocks due to Federal Banking Laws, even the ETFs are using swap agreements to hold the stock. Youll see the word SWAP in the holdings. Also, since its OTC most financial institutions won't allow employees to hold the OTC or foreign tickers, but they can hold the MSOS ETF.

[https://advisorshares.com/etfs/msos/](https://advisorshares.com/etfs/msos/)

Last week GOP Congress Nancy Mace proposed legislation to deschedule cannabis which effectively puts pressure on the Dems and Schumer, Booker, and Wyden if they decide to sandbag the SAFE Banking bill and use it as a wedge issue in 2022 Midterms. GOP and Dems will be competing to pass descheduling legislation in 2022 and will be a part of midterms campaigns next year (finally 25 years after CA voted for medical in 1996).

This week 23 state Governors sent a formal letter to the Senate requesting action.

[https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21101520/governors-marijuana-banking-letter.pdf](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21101520/governors-marijuana-banking-letter.pdf)

The IRS is having problems collecting from cannabis businesses and is urging for action. [https://www.marijuanamoment.net/top-irs-official-says-marijuana-banking-reform-would-help-feds-get-paid/](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/top-irs-official-says-marijuana-banking-reform-would-help-feds-get-paid/)

The SAFE banking Act sits in the Congress version of the NDAA, but not in the Senate version yet, potentially could pass the senate (not a guarantee). It's the Dems only chance at passing something on cannabis this year. [https://twitter.com/RepPerlmutter/status/1458519179787739138](https://twitter.com/RepPerlmutter/status/1458519179787739138)

If the SAFE Banking Act passes, FinCEN will have 180 days to issue guidance and many expect these companies will be eligible to uplist to US stock Exchanges even if cannabis remains a Schedule I drug.

Meanwhile the entire industry sits shorted with FINRA/Dark Pool volume above 50% for most of the tickers.

MSOS the largest US ETF for these CSE stocks, has seen record volumes over the last 4 days. I think it's time to squeeze these m'fers. Tickers of underlying US MSO stocks [https://twitter.com/junglejava1/status/1458992513084235780](https://twitter.com/junglejava1/status/1458992513084235780)

The Canadian names will also get squeezed I think $SNDL (Im long) and $TLRY

You dont need to care exactly how many stores nor do you need to care where they are located. 

What you do need to know if this:

- consumer retail and sporting good sales and margins have been on a historic tear ever since Covid hit. Sales of guns, ammo, outdoor sporting goods, youth sports, and home exercise equipment is through the roof. Will it end soon? Who cares. This is about the next week. 

- Big 5 is one of the most heavily shorted stocks out there - about 37.8% of the outstanding shares of BGFV are shorted. (That's four times the short interest seen as recently as early this year.)

- Big 5 has legit earnings and a great balance sheet. It is worth $1b (based on todays premarket trading), has $100m cash (grew cash by about $100m this year alone), no debt. 

- it pays a 2%+ dividend. Which weighs on the shorts. 

- it just announced an additional special dividend of $1 with an ex-date of November 17. 

- options activity is INSANE on this right now with huge call activity in the 50-60 range. The December 60 calls have a $6 premium and there are 2,700+ contracts out there. There are 8,900 November 60 contracts out there with a $3 premium. 

What does this all mean??

On November 17, every goddamn short share holder needs to pony up $1 for that special dividend. This will create a cash crunch on top of the short losses they have been piling up. 

And on November 19.the sellers of those call options need to go buy the shares to deliver them to the option holders.

I'll first descibe the basics of the company and then move forward to explain the amazing projects they are building under the ground with the main one project gg a social media platform for gamers that will leverage their 300M MAUs.

# The basics

**company description**

$EGLX *today* is an aggregation of a lot of different communities of gamers. Explicitely the company owns 100 websites, thousands of channels and influencers and the Luminosity gaming esport team making it one of the two gaming company to be on the comscore ranking of the top 100 internet propriety in the US with 300M monthly active users. You may not have heard the name of the company *Enthusiast Gaming* but there is 50% chance that you're consuming each month some of their content if you're in the US since the company published that 50% of all american males from 18 to 34 are monthly active users. 

&amp;#x200B;

**revenue model** 

the company makes money through 3 different streams described separetely within each financial reports:

https://preview.redd.it/yvf5m8vin5z71.png?width=901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b344b5f89853e86633db2da723976ef300afa2c

the revenue description

1. Media and content are basically all the ads accross all their different platforms
2. Esports and entertainment consits of the revenues from the esports tournaments of their team Luminosity and the events thy run accross the world
3. Subscription are all the different subscriptions accross their different websites.

A first and main insight from the revenues is that EGLX is able the make very few cents on each of its users currently. Based on the very last quarter 0.05$ per monthly active users every month.

The reason is that the revenues from ads are separated into two completely different categories: programatic and direct sales. The programatic ads brings very low revenues and auttomatically acquired by third parties like DSP and the direct sales very high revenues (100 times bigger based on EGLX data) but need to convince directly the brands to invest as *sponsor* for a complete package of entertainment within the company.

EGLX so far in its developement has being focusing on the acquisition of the different communities of gamers in an organic way. Succesing dramatically with that 300M MAUs that returns everymonth with absolutely no need of ads to bring them. Only lately EGLX invested heavily in the expension of its direct sales (50% growth from Q2 to Q3 and more than 100% from a year ago) which is one of the main reason of the dramatic growth of its revenues beside acquisitions. Yet only 3% of its ads inventaire is sell through direct sales so there is still a huge room to grow.

The subscriptions and the esports field are also growing fields with major potential since less than 1/1000 MAUs are subscribers today but the number are growing very fast (33% growth from Q2 to Q3 to 200k subscribers). 

**Losses, maturity and valuation**

[last quarter review of the operating and net loss](https://preview.redd.it/4r315obip5z71.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba845ae4c2085a19c0ff7f36bd0b8e5f12d2cf53)

As it can be easily seen from the table above the loss from a year ago went up only 50% while the revenues went up 168%. EGLX is improving its margin every quarter and as they said in the last conference call ""profitability in around the quarter"" and "" we have no intentions to raise any money in the foreseeable future through additional stocks selling"". So the company with its 33M$ cash in hands is well positioned to raise to profitability soon while keeping a double digit growth for the foreseeable future as well.

After the stock IPO a year ago the price went up very fast approx 800% from 1$ to 8.5$ and then during the last 7 months the price went down 53% to 3$ to a relatively cheap 3 P/S ratio. After the very last earnings they showed their strong ability to keep growing without big losses and jumped to 4.3$ during the day to close at 3.8$ thus the P/S ratio went to 4 where it stands now. On a short term technically basis the RSI is at 47 so absolutely not overbough and the MACD just sent before the closing yesterday a buying signal.

# Next step: project gg - the next social media around gamers and the while adoption of NFTs accross the platform.

While the very last section is attracting enough in itself I believe EGLX is much more than that and has the potential the become a 100x investment. The reason why? project gg.

There is a lot of different social media, roughly, facebook a friend based social media, instagram a photo based one, tiktok a video based one, reedit a forum based one and the list goes on. Yet there are no social media based on games discord is chat platform and twitch a streaming platform.

EGLX has finished to develop its social media platform for gamers with insane features (please see the youtube videos of Menashe the founder of EGLX to get more insights into the soon released features). The alpha version is already out and the beta version available to all will be out within 2 months.

With its 300M monthly active users, EGLX is uniquely placed in the horizon of the gamers community to promote its platform freely to hundred of million of gamers.

Imagine now the valuation that can be reached if the project is a sucess. Tiktok with its 1B MAUs on its platform is valuated at nearly 425B$. If EGLX manages the bring a modest 100M MAUs to the platform (fair number based on their 300M MAUs already) it could under a comparison the tiktok gives it 42.5B$ valuation a more than 100x jump from current 400M$ valuation.

EGLX also plan to implement the use of NFTs widely on its platform without describing much details yet but with clear intentions.

I recommend to anyone interest to listen to Menashe Kestenbaum the founder of CEO of the 2 youtube video he released the first one described the company generally and the second one (and end of first one) the project gg.

I am heavily invested and call all apes to join before the next 40% jump while the price of the stock is still oversold before the project gg becomes reality.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsab6e/eglx_investing_in_the_gaming_communities/

Why they didn't close their positions before the catalyst of the Infrastructure Package is beyond me and now they are over-shorted by a whopping 13.48% and 90% of them are in losing positions because of EVGO's run up the last few days.  Consider that those who shorted it on the 8th, Monday, did at $11. Now remember they're are short sellers with worse positions from the 5th and prior.

Here is the most recent press release on their website:

&amp;#x200B;

 

* Up to 25 Tre BEV trucks are expected to be delivered to dealers and customers by the end of 2021 and Tre FCEV is on schedule, and testing has begun
* Continued progress building out the sales and service network with dealers in 28 states consisting of over 130 locations

PHOENIX  November 4, 2021 -- [Nikola Corporation](https://www.nikolamotor.com/) (Nasdaq: NKLA), a global leader in zero-emissions transportation solutions, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.

""During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our business plan, said Mark Russell, Nikola's Chief Executive Officer. Validation of the Nikola Tre BEV is progressing, with trucks now being test-driven and tested on public roads. We also formally inaugurated our joint venture manufacturing facility in Ulm, Germany, and entered into additional strategic partnerships to advance our hydrogen refueling ecosystem with TC Energy and OPAL Fuels.

Russell added, with prospects of an SEC settlement, were looking forward to resolving the outstanding issues relating to our founder and bringing that chapter to a close and maintaining our focus on delivering trucks to our customers, and building the energy, service, and support infrastructure our customers need.  


**Nikola Tre BEV Validation and Pre-Series Progress**

During the quarter, progress continued validating the [Nikola Tre BEV](https://www.nikolamotor.com/tre-bev) in preparation for public road release in December 2021. As of today, we have completed eight (8) gamma trucks. We have begun building pre-series trucks in Coolidge, Arizona and continue to work steadfastly towards our commitment to deliver up to 25 trucks to dealers and customers by December 2021. The trucks will haul customer loads, gain real-world mileage accumulation, and in turn we expect to secure additional orders for 2022 volume and beyond.



**Nikola Tre FCEV Alpha Update**

As of today, we have built seven (7) [Nikola Tre FCEV](https://www.nikolamotor.com/tre-fcev) alphas, comprised of two (2) in Ulm and five (5) in Coolidge.

Footage of the Nikola Tre FCEV on the test track can be seen [here](https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/1450943156837515266).



**Progress Made at Nikola's Coolidge, Arizona Manufacturing Facility**

We have begun our Nikola Tre BEV pre-series builds in Coolidge. Trucks are on the assembly line and in process. As we are building our pre-series trucks, we are concurrently expanding the Phase 1 assembly expansion area to enable our total production capacity in 2022 of 2,400 trucks per year on two (2) shifts.

We anticipate the expanded Phase 1 will be completed in January 2022, and the construction of Phase 2 will begin immediately after that. Phase 2 is expected to be completed in early 2023, at which time our assembly hall will be fully built out with an installed process capacity of 20,000 units per year. The facility will be capable of building the Nikola Tre BEV and FCEV trucks on the same line, and also assembling the Bosch fuel-cell modules.

Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to: design and manufacturing changes and delays, including global shortages in parts and materials; general economic, financial, legal, regulatory, political and business conditions and changes in domestic and foreign markets; the potential effects of COVID-19; the outcome of legal, regulatory and judicial proceedings to which the Company is, or may become a party; demand for and customer acceptance of the Companys trucks; risks associated with development and testing of fuel-cell power modules and hydrogen storage systems; risks related to the rollout of the Companys business and the timing of expected business milestones; the effects of competition on the Companys future business; the availability of and need for capital; and the factors, risks and uncertainties regarding the Company's business described in the ""Risk Factors"" section of the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 filed with the SEC, as amended, in addition to the Company's subsequent filings with the SEC.

**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This press release references Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures and are presented as supplemental measures of the Company's performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other items the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating performance. Non-GAAP net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and certain other items the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating performance. Non-GAAP net loss per share basic and diluted is defined as non-GAAP net loss divided by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding. These non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

The Company believes that presenting these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors about the Company in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in financial and operational-decision making. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore any non-GAAP measures the Company uses may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs6vm6/why_we_should_all_support_69_nkla/

[https://public.wsu.edu/\~mreed/380American%20Consumption.htm](https://public.wsu.edu/~mreed/380American%20Consumption.htm)

### In the United States:

Reducing consumption without reducing use is a costly delusion. If undeveloped countries consumed at the same rate as the US, four complete planets the size of the Earth would be required. People who think that they have a right to such a life are quite mistaken.

Americans constitute 5% of the world's population but consume 24% of the world's energy.

On average, one American consumes as much energy as

o  **2 Japanese**

o  **6 Mexicans**

o  **13 Chinese**

o  **31 Indians**

o  **128 Bangladeshis**

o  **307 Tanzanians**

o  **370 Ethiopians**

  The population is projected to increase by nearly 130 million people - the equivalent of adding another four states the size of California - by the year 2050.

  Forty percent of births are unintended.

  Americans eat 815 billion calories of food each day - that's roughly 200 billion more than needed - enough to feed 80 million people.

  Americans throw out 200,000 tons of edible food daily.

  The average American generates 52 tons of garbage by age 75.

  The average individual daily consumption of water is 159 gallons, while more than half the world's population lives on 25 gallons.

  Fifty percent of the wetlands, 90% of the northwestern old-growth forests, and 99% of the tall-grass prairie have been destroyed in the last 200 years.

  Eighty percent of the corn grown and 95% of the oats are fed to livestock.

  Fifty-six percent of available farmland is used for beef production.

  Every day an estimated nine square miles of rural land are lost to development.

  There are more shopping malls than high schools.

### Percent of World Total

  250 million people have died of hunger-related causes in the past quarter-century  roughly 10 million each year.

  700 to 800 million people, perhaps even as many as a billion, don't get enough food to support normal daily activities

  Africa now produces 27% less food per capita than in 1964.

  1.7 billion people lack access to clean drinking water, and by the year 2000, the number of urban dwellers without access to safe water and sanitation services is expected to grow by 80%.

  0.1% of pesticides applied to crops reaches the pest, the rest poisons the ecosystem.

  Each year 25 million people are poisoned by pesticides in less developed countries, and over 20,000 die.

  One-third of the world's fish catch and more than one-third of the world's total grain output is fed to livestock.

  It takes an average of 25 gallons of water to produce a pound of wheat in modern Western farming systems. It takes 5,214 gallons of water to produce a pound of beef.

  Each person in the industrialized world uses as much commercial energy as 10 people in the developing world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs6mys/how_do_we_innovate_our_way_out_of_this/

Hello wallstreetbets,

&amp;#x200B;

Do any of you even bother with DCF modeling when choosing stocks to add to your portfolio? I tried modeling Ecolab ($ECL), and it was surprising to me that the terminal value, even at just a 3% growth rate (set equal to long-term US GDP growth), accounts for over three quarters of the model's value. I actually ended up with a really close value to the current stock price, but I can see how doing DCF on higher growth stocks can be a total shot in the dark three or four years out in the future.

Also, is it normal for a single-digit revenue-growing company to have such a low free cash flow yield? It's been hovering around 2-3% for the last 5 years. 

This was my first DCF model, so I could be oversimplifying things, but I appreciate any answers in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs5kh2/does_anyone_here_do_dcf_models_before_they_add/

Unfortunately, it's commonplace for Novavax struggling to meet the quality standards. The company vaccine time running out, another high-profile stumble could crush the company? Until later, it might be best to simply watch this developmental-stage biotech from the safety of the sidelines. After year and half with no federal fast regulatory track, Novavax Inc. executives, led by CEO Stan Erck, had to relay painful messages to investors multiple times 2020-2021. Their vaccine candidate, little known of the UK submission is it possible it may not even be certified as acceptable? This could be the reason they're not filing for a FDA vaccine trial possibly pushing back dates to end of year to reschedule to later unknown date once again.

The company had failed virus events in the earlier Covid 2006 &amp; 2017, and current event. Its leaders said they will submit to FDA by year-end, attempts to lure investors with pipe dreams and a mirage future. The future delays of FDA will happen by year-end in their evading FDA trial as it could mean they are trying to avoid the real question. Are executives reusing a failed FDA vaccine in 2016 FDA trials, to now give as global sales, secondly, did 30 percent of the workforce get laid off? Now, do we have poor quality vaccine made in India manufacturing that will not make product until next year with no clarity to when orders will actually start being sent out? The company is at a crossroads. The multiple competitors with Merck pills, Pfizer pills approval EUA any day or week. Tamiflu pills an approved antiviral.

According to the Fed, the current problems affecting the Chinese real estate market could spread around the world and cause global economic damage. The reason for this is to be identified in the close relations that China has with countries around the world and with the vastness of its economic-financial system. Furthermore, **any increase in interest rates could lead to a reduction in the demand for housing, and this would lead to a reduction in house prices, putting the sector even more in crisis.**

In particular, within its report, the FED talks about tightening financial conditions, which would lead to **an increase in the cost of the nation's debt** since it is seen as riskier in the eyes of investors. This downward spiral could lead to dangerous capital outflows into emerging markets that would also affect other economies including the US.

The American central bank, through its semi-annual report, therefore stated in no uncertain terms its concern on the entire Chinese real estate sector, referring in particular to China Evergrande Group.

1,"11/12/2021, 12:14:53",$ZM Puts on the upcoming earning. Again.,Borka_Dydka,"Good day peoples.

Before last earning and in few prior days to this I have seen $ZM pop op on my radar. Both times it came from no where with a thought ""Zoom is still a thing?"". So I did little DD on it. 

We all know that ZOOM is another virus baby and before that not a soul cared about their existence. For past months it have been down trading and being in the industry where meeting and calls are very common I am yet to see any large corporate use ZOOM. Teams have been a standard in engineering field where I work. Cut to the chase here is what statistics have to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. According to ZOOM website traffic, it have picked up slightly after last yearnings, and now down trading again after a minor recovery. My bet it is due to College and High School students in some places still needing to use it and starting school in August. Now it is dropping again because of breaks and more in person schooling start being available across states. (My uni uses teams)

[Source 1 for ZOOM.us traffic. ](https://preview.redd.it/hnv4crt873z71.png?width=2227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ea9b67258483eae02da73e83a94187d2c335f9)

   2. This can also be see from a second source.

   3. Another aspect I looked at was the trending rank of the app in the app store. In the USA it is on down trend the most, followed by UK. 

[ZOOM app rank](https://preview.redd.it/l6n21ks383z71.png?width=2120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2bda9a23a457eb7dcb1fb8bc143b389dd06f515)

4. Google statistic showed over all down trend. This chart was based on search, words, and news. As we can see it is been going down hill ever since we started going back to normal.  

[Google trends on ZOOM](https://preview.redd.it/y9z8qwti83z71.png?width=1539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a20eb2d3d93ef1dac1d0ea5cdf21b0e4ca82c24b)

5. Their website have also had a down turn of organic searches ever since June. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Zoom website organic searches ](https://preview.redd.it/wv5a1kt493z71.png?width=2137&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=564552cbdcaf3fa2080f90169779491b3ea3aa44)

&amp;#x200B;

Zoom works with corporations and makes money of the contract with large corporate America. Many of those use Teams and have already opened their offices therefore people work in person. Their expectation of growing is just not there and Teams being a Microsoft product that will come with Office 365 subscription there is little for ZOOM to hold ground with. 

Base on data and the fact I am yet to see anyone use zoom, or even speak about it, I believe it will flow on next earnings and puts will print.

Position: $230 Puts that expire on 11/26 and $220 Puts expire on 12/03

Posting an update now with my thoughts based on the recent earnings and news. I think from here on out the trajectory is pretty clear and barring anything changing the story, don't think any further updates will be of value.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzcsqv/ride\_still\_headed\_to\_zero/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzcsqv/ride_still_headed_to_zero/)

Listening to the earnings call today, I was much more impressed with Ninivaggi (CEO) and Kroll (CFO) as compared to the prior people as they both seemed a lot more realistic, while still trying to make the company look good. That said there are significant issues here and the lack of guidance for 2022 and the difficulty answering analyst questions indicates major doubts for the company in 2022. Following is a summary of key points that I think sum up critical aspects of the company. Going to try to avoid exposition, but cannot avoid making some estimates.

Also, apologies, this is a very deep dive and a bit technical and may be hard to read. Should be a warning, not suitable for Apes.

**Production Update:**

Customer deliveries are now hoped for Q3' 2022. This is moved up from previous suggestions that Q1' 2022 or Q2' 2022 would be when deliveries start.

**Sources of Funding:**

**1 - Equity Line of Credit (ELOC):**

The company still has their agreement with YA in place that allows them to sell at current share prices, up to 35,144,690 in shares (effectively at what the current market prices are). There are limits on how many shares can be sold at a time. In August and September the Company sold about 3.5M (Kroll said 3.9M on the call, but I think that was a mistake) shares for about $20M via this agreement.

**2 - ATVM Loan:**

No update here other than it is being pursued still. I have explained previously why I think getting this  loan should not be assumed.

**3 - Factory Sale to Foxconn:**

The Company agreed to sell their factory to Foxconn. RIDE retains their battery and hub motor lines. The target date for closing (i.e. when officially the assets are transferred) is 4/30/2022. Prior to closing they need to agree to a contract manufacturing agreement, where Foxconn will agree to contract manufacture the Endurance for RIDE. RIDE still needs to finish developing the Endurance and pay for Endurance specific tooling and will have to pay Foxconn for rent and for production of the vehicle. Basically, a typical contract manufacturing agreement, perhaps resulting in some deeper ties here between the companies.

The Foxconn transaction provides the following funding: (1) Foxconn paid $50M for 7,248,163 shares bought direct from the company in Oct, (2) on 11/18/2021 a $100M down payment, (3) on 2/1/2022 a $50M down payment, (4) on 4/15/2022 a $50M down payment, (5) on 4/30/2022 the $30M balance due at closing, and (6) on 4/30/2022 reimbursement for various costs (explained below).

Per the agreement Foxconn will reimburse RIDE for various costs laid out from Sep 2021 - Apr 2022. For operating costs, the reimbursement is 38% of such costs, limited to $3M per month. Assuming the cap is reached each month, for the 8 months it would be $24M reimbursed. Foxconn will also reimburse for various CAPEX costs, related to the facility and general equipment, but not Endurance specific items (nor the hub or battery lines, which RIDE retains). Now it was very unclear what portion of CAPEX is Endurance specific so some guessing is needed. It seems to me that the facility and general costs were incurred earlier on and now they are primarily incurring Endurance specific costs. I would guess maybe 25% of ongoing CAPEX costs are subject to reimbursement, but I may be off here by a significant amount. In terms of dollars, for Sep, that I estimate would be about $7M, for Q4' 2021, assuming $95M in CAPEX would be $24M. For Q1' 2022 another $25M (assuming $100M CAPEX) and another $8M for April 2022. Total CAPEX to be reimbursed would be about $64M. In total about $88M to be reimbursed 4/30/22.

**Cash Position and Projection:**

The company updated that as of 9/30/2021 they had $233.8M in cash.

Based on their projections to year end (using the upper-end of costs; if lower-end can be in total $55M less) their expenditures in Q4' 2021 will be $250M, less about $15M (due to noncash expenses and  changes in working capital). Add to this $50M for the equity to Foxconn and $100M for the down payment, you get year end  cash of 234-250+15+50+100=$149M, which is the lower end of their projected year end cash range of 150-180M.

In Q1' 2022 I estimated expenditures of about 240M (assuming they are not delaying costs, which will just result in delayed production ultimately). A high amount for Q1' is reasonable as they implied R&amp;D costs will be up due to testing of the vehicle. They have $50M coming in as a down payment in that quarter, so if these estimates are correct, their cash would be 149-240+50=(39M). The are required to maintain cash of $50M by 3/31/2022, so (A) they will have to either have lower costs or delay costs between Q4' 2021 and Q1' 2022 or (B) issue shares via YA.

For Q2' 2022, assuming a reduced rate of expenditure of, say about 200M (due to Foxconn taking on expenses), with the $50M down payment, $30M closing payment, and $88M reimbursement, which would have cash at (39M)-200+50+30+88=(71M).

(just to be clear, I am projecting for Q4' 2021 - Q2' 2022 assuming they don't delay expenses much. In reality they will need to delay, if they can't fundraise, so the actual timeline to run out of cash is much less certain.

Going forward to Q3' 2022, assuming minimal expenditure of $200M, with no significant revenue until at least Q4' 2022 (but that will be met with increased expenses related to scaling up production, so won't help cash). It would seem if the Q3' 2022 production timeline is to be met, minimally about 300M has to be raised by Q3' 2022, with another few hundred million by year end 2022.

These numbers are very speculative, as the company has not given guidance, but the point is not precision, but rather to understand that no matter how you approach this problem, it seems highly likely that by end of Q2' 2022 they are in a dire cash position and must either issue shares or find some other lifeline to go on. 

**Thoughts on Investment Possibilities**

In my prior post I suggested they would be out of cash by end of Q1' 2022. In the comments there, I acknowledged after I reviewed the Foxconn transaction a bit more that running out of cash in Q1' is less certain, so puts relying on an April catalyst would not be very certain. Based on the above, I think the trend is cash is running out during Q2', however with delaying various costs they might be able to extend that to Q3'. Don't think extending to Q4' 2022 or beyond would be very feasible, so they will need to fund-raise second-half of next year the latest, I think.

Put options I have been looking at have expiry in April 2022 or Jan 2023. There is nothing in-between. Problem with April is as mentioned above, does not seem any clear catalyst to move the price by then (with earnings for Q1' 2022 released likely in May, you don't even get a production update to move the stock by mid-April). Problem with Jan 2023 is Theta will kill you. Buying Puts is a gamble here and the returns not that great. Of course you can gamble on the April 2022 ones, in the hope the year end update (the Jan 2022 puts are too soon to benefit from the year end update) is damning and drives the share price down, but for me I don't see any clear catalyst to move the stock.

Perhaps shorting the stock might work well, but be prepared to keep the position through second half of next year. Also, be prepared for various pumps in this stock. All-in-all, cannot really recommend much strategy here. This is a company that is likely just experiencing a slow death, but without some deeper insight into who is going to sell, not sure much opportunity to profit.

Myself, have some $2.50 strike put options for April 2022 and Jan 2023. I think the Jan 2023 have a good chance of paying out, but I think you can find better opportunities to make money elsewhere. If I had to put a price target on this company it would be very low as I just don't see the company making it. On the other hand, market cap is low enough that it does not take many people to prop the share price up, so price targets might be meaningless. Tomorrow and perhaps the next few days and weeks might be telling as investors digest the news and make decisions whether to just stick with this or dump it. So some possibility there of options paying off.

Just one quick note about hub motors. They were asked in the call about some potential work with Foxconn on Foxconn's EV platform and where hub motors may fit in. Their response  was along the lines of hub motors don't work for everything. My take is that current management is having some doubts about hub motors, but maybe that is just me projecting.

As mentioned I think this may be my last post on this, as I already reduced my position and don't have much of a financial stake in this anymore that it is worth my time.

Izzy Dawood (Paysafe Chief Financial Officer) was on twitter today @ 7PM EST answering twitter user's questions.

Since twitter replies are abhorrent to follow. I'd though I would write a bunch down in one place Question following Answer style. Hope it makes it easy to gain some further insight on Paysafe and Izzy's responses to today's earnings report.

Thanks Izzy for taking the time to answer all of us shareholders.

Before Q and A

**Izzy**: before we start - I know everyone here and at the company (and me) are frustrated. I bought 50K shares in Aug and am going to buy over 100K shares tomorrow. I am a believer even though folks here want me fired. Lets go.

**Izzy:** I am a pretty large investor in this company - this is incredibly painful. Not a bystander

Questions and Answer

**Twitter User**: When are the divestitures from businesses going to end so they stop negatively affecting the bottom line. Is paylater done?

**Izzy**: PayLater was the only divestiture. YOY impact is done this quarter.

**Twitter User:** Is there any thought to consolidate Skrill Neteller and PSFE cash cards? It's too confusing. I still dont know the difference between Skrill and Netellar. Any thoughts for an all in one app?

**Izzy**: Skrill and Neteller are two wallet brands in different geographies. On the same platform. PaySafe card is not a card but it's called that. It's really for gamers/gamblers who want to use cash to bet online. It's a branding issue and not operational - the brands have been around different markets for over 10-15 years. in the US - it will be Skrill

**Twitter User:** The Skrill wallet needs to be THE go to wallet for gamblers, gamers, and cry\*pto users. It needs to be modern, sleek, sexy, user friendly, fast and safe. This reset is going to take investments. Besides Chirag, what is the plan to reset the digital wallet and how long do you see?

**Izzy**: Agree - we are making it much more modern. Chirag all over it - said it looks like an old bank app and I agree

**Twitter User:** What was with the eCash decline? I believe you cited tough comps. Any other issues?

**Izzy**: No issues - love the business. run rate is 26% higher than Q3 2019 (pre covid) - business mints money but for some reason it doesn't get the love

**Twitter User:** Who are your ecash competitors ? Venmo and cash app ?

**Izzy:** Truly no competition in the space. over a million distribution points globally and cash is used a lot more in latAm and Europe. In the US we are slowly adding partnerships but not the biggest cash market ... yet

**Twitter User:** Exactly I keep telling people there are no comparables to what PSFE does. Its not your avg fintech. They a niche specialist

**Izzy:** eCash absolutely winning. US business (small bus) in line but medium growth. Killing in cry\*pto/US iGaming space. Wallets need work to get mojo work

**Twitter User:** Can you explain relationship of Paysafe to Skrill US, the company consolidates results but does not own equity, it always makes me wondering who owns it?

**Izzy:** It's more of a technical/legal issue but we consolidate 100% and part of our US iGaming division. owned by TopCo that also has the BX/CVC shares

**Twitter User:** Is US igaming only 1.5% of PSFE total biz or IP biz? With all 50 states will become legal in due time with clear less restrictive regulatory issues. Do you see US igaming becoming a significant larger portion of PSFE business?

**Izzy:** When all the states are eventually legal and at full capacity, the US market is still going to be less than half the European/latAm market combined. We think we gamble but nowhere as much as the Europeans. Its legal and socially accepted. We killed it in 2016

**Twitter User:** This just isnt showing up in your numbers . Sports are back globally. Or maybe these numbers are too bogged down by the amount of equity issued?

**Izzy:** nothing to do with equity issued. its showing up in eCash, its showing up in NA iGaming - wallets needs to win back the merchants

**Twitter User:** ""Win them back"" from who if there's ""no competition"" as you said above?

**Izzy:** eCash no competition. Digital Wallets win back merchants. Hope that clarifies things

**Twitter User:** Could you elaborate more on win back merchants? What type of merchants have you lost?

**Izzy**: we haven't lost them - they have demphasized our wallet on their chekcout page and not doing promotions with us - thats what is meant by it. Already with Chirag, one of older merchants just opened up 8 markets for us we didnt have

**Twitter User**: Who is your big competition in the wallet segment? Who is doing well?

**Izzy**: General wallet is paypal. in online gaming its credit cards and bank transfers frankly - they are getting better

**Twitter User:** where is Bill Foley? This should be answered.

**Izzy:** Bill is very engaged and is VERY supportive. He isn't happy either with results but he sees us moving, taking action and all parts except Digital Wallets is doing well

**Twitter User:** Izzy, Sightline. What is the deal with sightline and foley?

**Izzy:** We are 100% online. Sightline 100% focused on land based casino experience. Complementary

**Twitter User:** Would a stock buyback be in the cards now? I think mgmt should make a public display of buying shares. I think the company should do a buy back at this price of some shares. I also think you should get some of the big investors to buy back. CONFIDENCE ISSUE

**Izzy**: Agree to disagree here. we need to perform and bring down leverage which helps tremendously. Also BX/CVC.Foley are fully committed and engaged. Truly believe performance takes care of itself but takes time

**Twitter User:** Is Bx and cvc STILL fully committed after today?

**Izzy:** 1000% percent - very engaged

**Twitter User:** Can you Address what I think is a lack of confidence that we all have now?

**Izzy:** Some of us have lost over 60% and it's frustrating. From the SPAC we missed two expectations. First - we are going to make around $430M and not $485M. Bigger issue is that Digital Wallet has not performed.

Another way to think about it is that we were expected to be A+ students and came back with a C report card. with a big F in Digital Wallets

**Twitter User:** Yeah you call it the way you see it...So the digital wallet thing is big. I know it's one of the reasons I was excited about you in your return to the market. How did the digital wallet go so bad so quickly? you went from a B student to an F in 3 months why did we not know ?

**Izzy:** We knew it was struggling and one of the reasons the stock kept moving downwards. We replaced management in the division in July and really started digging in. Should have moved sooner IMHO

**Twitter User:** Are you able to be more specific on what about the digital wallet was an unforeseen challenge? Was it partnerships, competition, regulation, misinterpretation of research. What was the surprising factor?

**Izzy:** It was a business that did not evolve as the markets became regulated and competition (banks/cards) got better. Plus prior management forgot that we are there to solve the merchant's problems and not just mark short term gains. Chirag is winning them back one at a time.

**Twitter User**: Is whipping Skrill into shape going to require a lot of cap ex?

**Izzy:** Actually no - lot more focus with current cap ex and better execution

**Twitter User:** Are there plans to go into banking charter? Is SafetyPay potentially able to do so? Mastercard is going into cry\*pto fiat currency cash cards, competition or collaboration based on past relationships?

**Izzy:** No serious plans about banking charters - lots of capital and additional regulations. we are happy providing payment solutions for cry\*pto/gaming merchants

**Twitter User:** How is the Cross-selling pipeline going? Specifically in LATAM. A lot of activity there?

**Izzy:** it's going better than expected but still early days

**Twitter User:** why not go public with the august purchase?

**Izzy:** I didn't think it was big enough and frankly, performance matters more. We have not executed to the level we needed to

**Twitter User:** Paysafe spent $700M on $60M revenue in acquisitions. Being valued at 2 times revenue now it appears better deal to buy own shares? Why not buybacks? Thanks

**Izzy:** the acquisitions are already outperforming and PSFE. Right now our leverage would not go down if we bought back shares - that is important. Ent Value - Debt = equity value.

**Twitter User:** how to read 2022 preliminary forecast? is this bare bones with an upside just to stay safe or no organic growth due to wallets ( excluding acquisitions revenues)? Thanks

**Izzy:** we have derisked our outlook but frankly investors (righrfully) will wait and see 6-9 months before they believe us.

**Twitter User:** your the CPA and my question for you based on rev and cash in the bank use the current quarter what is fair value for PSFE? Hard to think based on REV and assets 4.24 is a fair price?

**Izzy:** Fair value - we should be at least 16-18X ebitda for enterprise value. subtract debt and that gets you equity value. Today we are trading at 2X EBITDA ... mind blowing

**Twitter User:** So based on all that now I have to be worried that someone comes in and buys you ll for less than I bought the stock

**Izzy:** They will have to convince Foley/BX/CVC - plus its not something I focus on

**Twitter User:** i think you mean 6 times EBITDA and 2 times revenues?

**Izzy:** 6X EBITDA ent value but turns out to be 2X EBITDA equity value - thats that I meant

**Twitter User:** obviously disappointed with the share price, but why do you think WS is punishing Paysafe so much? Institutional ownership in Q3 was over 560M, despite those metrics have been denied from the beginning any ideas?

**Izzy:** I am puzzled too - these levels are mind boggling.

**Twitter User:** Phil needs to go. He cant communicate properly.

**Izzy:** agree to disagree. If he goes, I go too but that may be ok with everyone here. every decision makes someone happy

**Twitter User:** Why did the CEO say that PSFE would not be interested in a buyout? After today, it would seem like the best thing for shareholders.

**Izzy:** 70% controlled by BX/CVC/Foley - they are not sellers especially at this level

**Twitter User:** Thank you Izzy for the chat and for being candid about everything. Knowing what we all know now, valuation was way high, given the management was not in place to meet the Wallstreet expectation QoQ. Is there any strategic plan to fix this mess in the short term?

**Izzy:** I think you said it. set expectations you can beat ... right?

**Twitter User:** So you sandbanged the earnings with that guidance huh??

**Izzy:** Still gotta perform

**Twitter User:** Obviously there must be contact with the company amd Loeb and Tepper. What is their stance on the company now and have they unloaded? Will they be adding from here?

**Izzy:** We talked to them today and they have been constructive and supportive - doesn't mean they are happy - no shareholder is

**Twitter User:** Are they staying the course or cutting bait? If staying the course was there any mention of adding down here?

**Izzy:** Didn't give any indication either way and we didn't ask either

**Twitter User:** Please respond to the relationship between psfe and Loeb amd Tepper. These are 2 very big players in the investment world amd you had them. Are they gone now?

**Izzy:** We did calls with 3P and appaloosa today which assumes they are still shareholders. we did have two others who cancelled so presumable those two aren't shareholders anymore

**Twitter User:** A lot of us are shocked how this went so wrong so fast. With the business facing significant challenges there is now a credibility issue as well. Does management have a plan in place to restore credibility and confidence? At the very least is that issue even acknowledged?

**Izzy:** thats what happened today. the plan is to set expectations that we have been C students - and we have to come in with Bs and As

**Twitter User:** What is the nature of the relationship with ARC? Do they directly use our gateway/processing? Or are we looking to win processing/acquiring from the travel merchants themselves? Any big wins with safeguarding?

**Izzy:** They use our gateway to process card transactions. ARC works with travel agencies

**Twitter User:** With 20+ years experience, how was the regulations in Europe not anticipated, seems like a huge misstep?

**Izzy:** was anticipated - put the impact was far greater - even Flutter talked about it

**Twitter User:** 75% US 100% Canada. How much in Europe and Latam?

**Izzy:** we dont process in Europe and LatAm - its all eCash and Digital Wallets. We have about 7-10% of the cashier/checkout

**Twitter User:** Is there plan to process in Europe or LatAm? Or are there other regulatory constraints to process in these two markets?

**Izzy:** Processing focus is in US/Canada - newer markets. lots of established players in Europe and not as lucrative as as fast growing either

**Twitter User:** any conspiracy theories to answer the puzzle? Did Bill cross some bankers taking you public?

**Izzy:** Haha - no conspiracies. Bill wants us to do better, I want us to do better, everyone wants us to do better

**Twitter User:** Thanks! This is the open banking thing Phil talked about. What will be your right to win or competitive advantage against them.

**Izzy:** big one is having all the bank integrations and knowing how to do them. SafetyPay is a leader in the space

**Twitter User:** Is Mastercard still a friend or a foe big moves in cry\*pto cashcards in Asia?

**Izzy:** We have very limited presence in Asia - reg environment is very unpredictable

**Twitter User:** I think a big question everyone has is..is digital business not as good as we thought.

**Izzy:** Clearly has not performed. It has over 100 payment methods tied to it, global reach and has potential - keeps us excited. making great strides in cry\*pto as well

**Twitter User:** Super helpful. Thank you. Last q - do take rates have to materially come down for you to be competitive again in wallets?

**Izzy:** I don't think so - its not a rate issue as we are already cheaper than the others for the merchants. Its about getting back to solving merchant problems. For us iGaming is core, we are ok with risk - the other wallets dont focus in this space

**Twitter User:** What was Foley and companies outlook, 5-10 years?

**Izzy:** I think there is something out there in merger proxy they filed in Feb

**Twitter User:** Can you tell us more about Phil as a CEO? Honestly he comes across as indifferent to whole situation. He does the calls and maybe an analyst sit down but thats all we hear. More people mention foley/grasso/Izzy when it paysafe comes up than Phil. Is he furious, motivated?

**Izzy:** He is a competitor and very focused. has operator background so digs into details and execution. main reason rest of the business has performed. Digital wallets is the last piece. Very loyal to company and his team is loyal to him

**Twitter User:** any plans for ecash integration into NA banking apps? similar to what I'm seeing here on viacash.com . Seems like a big opportunity for further ecash integration in the US, and an upgrade over traditional ATM withdraw / deposit. also am a very gutted shareholder

**Izzy:** nothing imminent - the M&amp;A integrations are priority 1, 2 and 3

**Twitter User:** Would Phil come on twitter and talk to retail is that something he would do?

**Izzy:** Don't know - but frankly, I want him focused on the clients, employees and the business.

**Twitter User:** I respect you showing up tonight.. You did not have to show up. To be honest after today I'm certain that 99% of people in your situation would not. I respect you showing up.. Don't respect the performance to date.. However you can change the narrative...

**Izzy:** Stock Performance SUCKS to date - 70% of the company doing well, have to fix wallets and beat new expectations of a C student

**Twitter User:** Izzy, thank you for showing up. Too much to ask for you to follow up on safeguarding volumes?

**Izzy:** I will have to check but its not a large number - its a good solution, clients like it

**Twitter User:** I read in a filing you were allowed to buy 15,000 shares at $2. Is that fake news?

**Izzy:** yup - bought it when I joined. those were all pre SPAC

**Twitter User:** Every call we hear the b\*zz word cross selling but can you elaborate what that looks like and when we will see results.

**Izzy:** When we have a relationship with an online gaming merchant, we are able to sell eCash, wallet and open banking as stand alone or via Unity which is a single API solution with multiple payment methods

**Twitter User:** Izzy, Thank you for your time tonight. You are very educated on the business and I look forward to hearing more from you in the future! Thank you for your time,hit em straight!

**Izzy:** Will be back in a week or so. Appreciate many of you for keeping it civil even though many of you are rightfully frustrated.

**Twitter User:** any plans for ecash integration into NA banking apps? similar to what I'm seeing here on viacash.com . Seems like a big opportunity for further ecash integration in the US, and an upgrade over traditional ATM withdraw / deposit. also am a very gutted shareholder

**Izzy:** nothing imminent - the M&amp;A integrations are priority 1, 2 and 3

**Twitter User:** Would Phil come on twitter and talk to retail is that something he would do?

**Izzy:** Don't know - but frankly, I want him focused on the clients, employees and the business.

**Twitter User:** I respect you showing up tonight.. You did not have to show up. To be honest after today I'm certain that 99% of people in your situation would not. I respect you showing up.. Don't respect the performance to date.. However you can change the narrative...

**Izzy:** Stock Performance SUCKS to date - 70% of the company doing well, have to fix wallets and beat new expectations of a C student

**Twitter User:** Izzy, thank you for showing up. Too much to ask for you to follow up on safeguarding volumes?

**Izzy:** I will have to check but its not a large number - its a good solution, clients like it

**Twitter User:** I read in a filing you were allowed to buy 15,000 shares at $2. Is that fake news?

**Izzy:** yup - bought it when I joined. those were all pre SPAC

**Twitter User:** Every call we hear the buzz word cross selling but can you elaborate what that looks like and when we will see results.

**Izzy:** When we have a relationship with an online gaming merchant, we are able to sell eCash, wallet and open banking as stand alone or via Unity which is a single API solution with multiple payment methods

**Twitter User:** Izzy, Thank you for your time tonight. You are very educated on the business and I look forward to hearing more from you in the future! Thank you for your time,hit em straight!

**Izzy:** Will be back in a week or so. Appreciate many of you for keeping it civil even though many of you are rightfully frustrated. You are all shareholders and always have a choice of putting good out there in the world",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs2u57/paysafe_cfo_izzy_dawood_qa_on_twitter_psfe/

1,"11/12/2021, 11:35:08",So why would a company like $GOOG buy a company like $CLOV ???,BigDfromLV," 

FYI, my opinions. Not inside information and not financial advice. This is an argument for a mutually beneficial business combination via acquisition.

OK, so why would a company like $GOOG buy a company like $CLOV for at least $30/share?

The bigger question is why one of the current big healthcare giants ($UNH - $430B MC, $ANTM $105B MC, $HCA - $76B MC, $CI - $72B MC, $HUM - $57B MC,) wouldnt buy $CLOV first to prevent having to compete with Google? The fact is they may not even be in the discussions due to the strong existing relationships between $CLOV management and $GOOG, but they should do whatever they can, and pay whatever it takes, to make sure this group does not reunite.

Well first, maybe reunite is not quite correct as in fact, they are already partners. Google was one of the lead investors that helped launch $CLOV.

[https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/technology/google-parent-company-invests-big-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/technology/google-parent-company-invests-big-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health)

So why would Google, a tech company, want to invest ad/or partner/acquire Clover, a medical insurance company? Heres a few reasons:

Clover Health is primarily a tech company. Theres a great interview with the CEO Vivek Garipalli.

[https://youtu.be/uLmXHEHNsZo](https://youtu.be/uLmXHEHNsZo)

This is definitely worth the hour to listen as it gives great insight into how the concept of Clover Health came to be and more importantly, where it is going. Of particular interest, Vivek talks about how this was developed as a tech company. They had such amazing technology and AI, which would develop into Clover Assistant, but there was a problem. The issue was given the current setup of the medical industry, there was no incentive in place for the end user (i.e. the medical practices) to spend any funds on software to make patient outcomes better and more efficient. As Vivek explains, they soon realized to find the market that would see the value in their technology, they would have to create that market. Sounds very similar to many tech companies that are ahead of their time.

2)

Google has been interested in using AI to reinvent the $3T US healthcare industry for many years.

[https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/google-strategy-healthcare/](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/google-strategy-healthcare/)

Doesnt this sound like something the team leading Clover would say:

In a statement provided to Fierce Healthcare, a Google spokesperson said ""Google deeply believes in the power of technology to improve health and wellness and we have increased our health investments across the company.

Clover Health Mission Statement

On a mission to improve every life, Clover uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients.

While they had created an internal Google Health division in 2018, they have since disbanded the division. It seems like many large companies, Google needs entrepreneurs to basically handle outsourced innovation. In many cases like this, once the group better identifies the opportunities, defines the market, and proves out a workable model, an acquisition makes sense for all parties. As CTO Andrew Toy said in an Oct interview, I truly believed you had to be within the healthcare industry, and specifically a payer, to then build great technology and have the fulcrum to make a difference.""

As you can read in the links below or doing a quick Google search, while the division was dismantled, their appetite to be in healthcare has not diminished.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/08/21/google-dismantling-health-division/?sh=8f056abe4011](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/08/21/google-dismantling-health-division/?sh=8f056abe4011)

He also was quoted on an Oct interview saying, ""I took a bit of an unusual choice instead of founding a company that worked within Google Health, Amazon, or Microsoft. I truly believed you had to be within the healthcare industry, and specifically a payer, to then build great technology and have the fulcrum to make a difference."" This is the thinking outside the box that large established companies cannot do. They need to let people like Vivek and Andrew create a successful model and then just buy it out.

3)

Clover has incredibly deep relationships with Google. Im sure most of you already know CTO Andrew Toy, the genius behind the Clover Assistant, has already developed a startup company, refined the model, proved it out, and sold it to Google.

[https://www.businessinsider.com/googles-120-million-divide-acquisition-2014-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/googles-120-million-divide-acquisition-2014-10)

Im still looking for the article or interview I saw where I believe Andrew commented on picking up a number of new hires from the disbanded Google division but I have not found it. Maybe my mind is laying tricks on me but I swear I remember reading or hearing that somewhere. If anyone has that drop it in the comments.

4)

The combination makes senseand billions of dollars.

Now just imaging the power of the combined forces of Google with all of their data and Clover with the business model to monetize that data, as well as further leveraging it with their specific patented technology, the Clover Assistant.

Clover brings proprietary technology that is now proven to provide increasing benefits the longer it is used. (That was noted in the earnings conference call this week).

They have a duplicatable model as Vivek discussed in the interview above, where they are the #2 MA insurer in New Jersey. Theyre now looking to duplicate that in Georgia, and then spread to every market nationwide.

Remember: 1) identify the opportunities; 2) define the market, and; 3) prove out a workable model.

Thats Clover!

Whats Google bring, everything else

Seriously, Clover is now at the point where they just need to duplicate their model in more counties, and the more lives under management, the more data, the better it works. Google brings unlimited resources both in human capital, working capital, technology infrastructure, and political capital. Having Chelsea on the Board is great, but Ill go with Googles political clout over that any day.

I already see $COV on their own growing to $2.5-$3+ Billion in sales next year, and potentially in the $5B range with solid profitability in 2023. With Google behind them, Id start adding zeroes to those numbers.

So where did the $30 come from?

This is my theory based on looking at it from both perspectives. I really dont see the founders at Clover selling out for $10/share  thats not happening. $20? We should be over that already. But $30, thats the number set as a target to unlock founders shares. Now that lockup has passed, but psychologically, that was the number they felt was a big enough return that management should be rewarded early, and its just my opinion that the $30 number, probably making the founders all billionaires, coupled with the fact they could feel certain their creation would become a dominant factor in the marketplace, would get a deal done. Note: I personally think its worth a lot more in the near future, but thats probably a pretty decent price today.

Now from Googles perspective, they have a replicatable model, ready to scale immediately, that plays to all of their strengths. At $30, were talking about a $12B acquisition so it needs to have a lot of runway ahead of it to make that kind of investment pencil out. Just the medicare market is $1T annually and growing fast. (MA grew 9.6% this year). With a handful of big players, but no dominant force in the market, the potential is there for Google to grow this into a $100B business quickly, Id say within 5 years. That would be less than a 10% share of the market leaving lots of room to grow. What would that be worth? A lot more than the acquisition costs plus $5-10B to make it happen, a lot more. This would likely be one of the most profitable acquisitions Google ever makes.

Tl;dr Theres nothing scarier to me than $GOOG controlling all of our healthcare too, but it would be a great deal for them, for $CLOV, and for all of the $CLOV shareholders, so what the heck. Rocket time!

Tl;dr-2 The current big healthcare players should be scared of this combination and in my mind, they should pay whatever amount north of $30/share is needed to prevent $CLOV from joining the $GOOG empire.

Let's start at the beginning, GRAB is a multibillion-dollar food delivery/courier/shipping/grocery delivery service that has total control of the southeast Asian market. It has been flexible and adaptive to COVID and the ever-changing markets that ensue. It has driven out competitors like uber to reign supreme and it's well on its way to the US. They posted strong Q3 results today that held up to extremely strict lockdown measures to post record merchandise revenue results. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grab-reports-third-quarter-2021-110000140.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grab-reports-third-quarter-2021-110000140.html))

They have a strong outlook and are looking to expand into China and move to the US as well. Meanwhile, they have financial backers such as Blackrock, Barclays, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanely and are currently valued at around 40 Billion. They are on track to do a reverse merger with AGC which will have the potential for a short-term play. However, GRAB expects the market to expand from 52 Billion in 2020 to 180 Billion by 2025. When these guys merge it will be the largest SPAC merger EVER. They have already started the process of filling and gaining approval from the SEC. Some people believed today would be the official announcement but there is still time for them to announce it before the end of the year as they have promised. (The merger is confirmed but not announced officially yet.)

This brings us to AGC, Altimeter Growth Corp is about to be thrust into the spotlight. When AGC and GRAB merge there will be an institutional lockout for THREE years, where institutions own 69.82% of total shares with 50 million outstanding; The short interest is also 38.81%. There is a potential for a short-term play but also strong fundamentals to have this in your long-term portfolio. While talk about this is relatively small AGC just hit a 1 billion market cap today and has been mostly under the radar.

From similar plays that I have been exposed to this year like CLOV, GME, and AMC I expect this to run easily to the 25-35 dollar range. I bought 13-14 dollar calls last week and have 350 shares at 15.05. Calls are still relatively cheap for something with this much exposure. Look for a strong run-up to the announcement then a potential short-term play. Happy Hunting Apes.

The future delays of FDA will happen by year-end in their evading FDA trial as it could mean they are trying to avoid the real question. Are executives reusing a failed FDA vaccine in 2016 FDA trials, to now give as global sales, secondly, did 30 percent of the workforce get laid off?

Yet,shakenbake705,"Let's start at the beginning, GRAB is a multibillion-dollar food delivery/courier/shipping/grocery delivery service that has total control of the southeast Asian market. It has been flexible and adaptive to COVID and the ever-changing markets that ensue. It has driven out competitors like uber to reign supreme and it's well on its way to the US. They posted strong Q3 results today that held up to extremely strict lockdown measures to post record merchandise revenue results.

They have a strong outlook and are looking to expand into China and move to the US as well. Meanwhile, they have financial backers such as Blackrock, Barclays, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanely and are currently valued at around 40 Billion. They are on track to do a reverse merger with AGC which will have the potential for a short-term play. However, GRAB expects the market to expand from 52 Billion in 2020 to 180 Billion by 2025. When these guys merge it will be the largest SPAC merger EVER. They have already started the process of filling and gaining approval from the SEC.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not gonna go in-depth about Canoo as a company. If you're on WSB then you've probably heard of Canoo. Regardless we all just throw money around any way, so fuck it, if you really give a shit then do some research.

&amp;#x200B;

To cut to the chase, Canoo is having its' Earnings Report next Monday (11/15/2021). Because Canoo is a newer EV company they obviously don't have any true earnings to announce. The idea is that Tony Aquila (CEO of Canoo) will use this call to drop some good news. But will he drop news? and if so, what?

&amp;#x200B;

**That's where the true speculation begins.**

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of information has been leaked that Tony Tequila has not commented on or has barely acknowledged and is not priced-in. The next logical thought process is; What information does Tony Tequila have that hasn't been leaked yet? Will Tony Tequila comment on any of the leaked information or release any new information?

Well, what I'm saying, is that there are known-knowns and that there are known-unknowns. But there's also unknown-unknowns; things we don't know that we don't [know.](https://youtu.be/2msQwpzatQc?t=23)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's some known-knowns that hasn't received a lot of press and has barely moved the stock price:**

\- Canoo announcing battery supply agreement with Panasonic

\- Canoo's attendance of the Certified Pest Control Operators of Georgia's 23rd annual conference

\- An insane amount of new hires including people from Nio, Tesla, Harley Davidson, etc.

\- Canoo partnership with VDL Nedcar to manufacture vehicles

\- Canoo's MPDV nominated for Red Dot Design Award

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's some of the known-unknowns that Canoo hasn't commented on or has barely acknowledged:**

\- Pictures of the new sedan (leaked, unannounced)

\- Frontdoor Collective ordering 10,000 delivery vans by 2024 from Canoo (barely acknowledged, hardly any press)

\- [AirAsia](https://i.imgur.com/WpY2qVX.png) partnering with Canoo for its' new rideshare program (YouTube video uploaded by AirAsia then made private soon after)

\-Tony Aquila's Form 4 showing him become a majority shareholder in the company

&amp;#x200B;

**Unkown-unkowns?**

\- Who the fuck does know. Looking at the past knowns, it could be anything (Canoo-Apple partnership? /s)

The obvious idea behind unknown-unknowns is that Tony ""butt fuck"" Tequila could release information that hasn't been leaked that no one knows of.

**A little bonus spice:**

Now I want to make it clear that this is mostly an earnings play.

&amp;#x200B;

But I can't leave out the the insane volume of open interest for the 11/19 calls. Currently there are 56,598 options that are currently OTM. 17,069 of them are for the $10 strike. Current stock price as of writing this is is around $8.50. If the 10 strike calls get close to being ITM then GOEV could go parabolic.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to reiterate, this is not a GME type fresh orange juice play, this is speculation on the Earnings Report being received well by the market. But the fact that OTM OI is so high, could help this stock fly. Just an added bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Canoo ($GOEV) will release some big news that makes the market excited for the company. When big news then big moves. High OI make stock fly.

&amp;#x200B;

I will add links for proof to the above claims in a comment below. Auto-mod is a bitch.

this little company that has followed most of us since our first steps into the vast network of Facebook and flash games world. 

While some of us were casually farming crops in FarmVille, others had their first experiences with gambling on Zynga Poker. All of us had one thing in common, for a shorter or longer duration of time we were completely HOOKED. 

Sadly, over time this hype had died down a little. We grew up, we finally got cash to play much better games, that were actually less mindless than trying to figure out how to make flour in the most effective way or how to break up enemy racketeering shops in Mafia wars, without wasting too much energy points. 

That's when one very interesting thing happened though: smartphones became mainstream. 

Now Zynga as a producer of low effort games, that arguably could've been made by anyone back then, had one benefit. They had a fuckton of IPs that were very easily remake-able into the smartphone versions. And that's exactly what they did! 

As every kid, mom, granny and bored wifey that just didn't want to fuck her boyfriend spent hours and hours grinding the next farm building in-game, the advertisement money was pouring in and boy has it kept being fucking gorgeous. 

Zynga revenue stream has steadily doubled every year since 2018 till now. Currently we're talking about $700 million per quarter. Now you might be thinking: ""hey, wasn't it because there was a global pandemic and everybody was just kind of bored as shit? Won't they just stop playing now that the pandemic seems to be getting better?"" To that I answer you: yes, you're correct!

HOWEVER, (and here is the main reason why Zynga is the only interesting mobile and F2P gaming company rn)
Zynga is releasing a peculiar game next year: Star Wars: Hunters. Now this game in itself is nothing that much new. It's a classic MOBA game with the vibe of Paladins and Overwatch. The interesting part is this, once released it will be a cross platform game.
Yeah, like Fortnite, and Hearthstone for example. And it's a Star wars game! And what's maybe even more important, it's the first proper action game title of the company!

This game in itself holds a lot of promise! If successful, it will open a floodgate of revenue, which in my opinion could double what we currently have within the next year, easily. Also the soft launch begins sometime in the next month or so, so that  could be a decent stock catalyst.

Now, if that hasn't made your deep down nerd interested enough, there's another bombshell: Zynga has made a couple eye catching acquisitions this year.

 First, let's look at Echtra.

 That's the company that has made the wonderful games that are the first two Diablo's and the Torchlight series! This acquisition just shows how much they want to move from the mundane boring world of mobile gaming into the incredible and colourful (and most importantly actually good graphically looking) world of console and PC gaming, and if not that then at least improve their mobile games quality to keep up with the demand for more technologically advanced games! 

Now for the second curious acquisition this year, and arguably financially more interesting one: Chartboost.

This company offers their clients a platform for in-game monetisation and ad revenue streamlining. It was ranked 6th most effective platform for this type of activity on Android in 2019, and it's software and SDK (software development kit) is used in over 300k games and over 40 billion game sessions a month.

With this acquisition, Zynga is basically building a vertical monopoly on ad revenue in their games (and a bit of revenue stream from other games as well)!

Now of course with all of this beautiful information comes risk. The company hasn't really been very good to it's investors. Since the IPO it hasn't once reached it's IPO price and it has been using stock dilution as a means of financing quite often (the most recent case was the price  drop from 12$ to 10$. But at least we know that they have been putting the money to a very good use as the acquisition targets show. 

In my opinion the main problem of the stock right now, is that since it is now rather obscure in the gaming space, it doesn't have as much hype behind it. And the shorts are having a field day. Currently 50% of all dark pool trades on this stock is shorting, because it is easy and most of the people just hold, because they can't do much against it.  This should hopefully change soon though, as the earnings in Q4 should prove to be good with the revenue from FarmVille 3 and Chartboost as a solid BOOSTER (hehe) shot! 

As to what the analysts think, the current analyst sentiment is fairly unanimous BUY with the avg price of $11, which is about 68% upside in near term. And the justification for this price is mostly their solid acquisitions and their growth potential, which seems pretty much limitless! 

Now we have come to the end of this DD. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. 

TL;DR 
Zynga is a majestic piece of 60 carat crude diamond, which just seems to be growing before our own very eyes. The potential is amazing, and it is very much worth holding. However, it's a pretty high risk play as the company is pretty badly dark pool shorted with low hype behind it.

1,"11/12/2021, 09:35:40",BFGV,Matt-lopez117,"Whats up fellow theta gang,

I believe there is an opportunity to punish long unlike anything we have seen since GME, or SPRT in recent memory. $BGFV is issuing a special dividend on Dec 1st, 2021, with ownership date needing to be recorded by November 19th, 2021. Some retards think that special dividends equate to a catalyst , or something that as the sentence expressing this view is incomprehensivle. They saw this scenario played out June 2020, and now think its going to happen again. A $1/share was issued in June with about 4.2 million shares sold short at the time. The price of BGFV was at $19/share then catapulted to $38/share on this special dividend run up or short covering catalyst, so clearly the same exact thing will happen once gain.

With the current price of 45 and 8.5m shares sold short they believe this is entirely possible to hit well into the high 70s if it follows the past trend. They think what has also changed with this squeeze is that funds are aware of how hard they can punish short sellers since the GME/AMC/SPRT squeezes. So this idiots ""believes"" this even has the potential to reach well into $100/share range.
[4:20 PM]
Moreover, they say there is a fuck ton of buying pressure on BGFV due to being included into the Russel 3k which is forcing a ton of large institutions/ETFs to buy into BGFV at a high rate. There is a total of 22.3m shares outstanding with -4.6m -1.7m being held by institutions/management which leaves us with a total of 16m shares left available to be sold short. Also, the market cap is under 1b so they believe there is truly some crazy opportunity to push this thing higher once large funds begin to see an opportunity. 

This idiot actually believes with the combination of factors happening here, they (whoever they are) could see the potential for fireworks next week before the record date for the special dividend 11/19, so the play is to sell those keks as many calls as possible. This is not financial advice but make your own decision and fucking send it.

1,"11/12/2021, 09:11:43",Novavax Covavax a long awaited failure. Read why.,Mundane-Knowledge-87,"Buy Puts Novavax now, here is why,

The covavax NVAX protein spike vaccine and MRNA vaccine was known to induce heart inflammation in the animal study trial and severity of having made a fast warp speed vaccine trial on humans for the first time have shown adverse events to cause myocarditis and pericarditis, as a result. The number of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis reported with the vaccines in the UK remains to continue to closely affect more young adults these events reported in the UK and internationally. Heart inflammation is a complication seen to stop the heart beat. Novavax will almost certainly fall short of its hopes to position with COVAVAX as the long-awaited FAILURE to their other failed product Synagis, leaving the market for competitors to have market share. The clinical update expecting, Novavax, vaccine ongoing study show in pregnant women to make issues with birth, vision, hearing, skin, neurological disorders, it showed similar results on animal experiments by NIH and BARPA scientists.

Novavaxs failed vaccine trial last covid outbreak in 2016 and the event was devastating to the stock price as if someone was in the final week of construction on a dream home only to have a natural disaster blow through and knock the top floors down.  Company has 2/2 failed virus events in the prior Covid in 2006 &amp; 2017, and we are now on the third event.  Hatrick?

After year and half with no federal fast regulatory track, Novavax Inc. executives, led by CEO Stan Erck, had to relay a painful message to investors multiple times since 2020: Their vaccine candidate meant to protect fails to work, little known of side effects as UK submission may not even be certified as acceptable, this could be the reason their not filing for a FDA vaccine trial possibly pushing back dates to end of year to reschedule to later unknown date once again.  Covavax product no sales current as it lost $351 million last quarter, it is still being priced in to have billions of doses finished 2022 by preorder   hadnt come close to meeting those targets in its vaccine trials. The insiders of stock meanwhile sold  $100,000,000 in their company.

Investors devastatingly could see its stock shed 70 percent of its value within day, with the stock low float and 60 percent owned by few large investors. Its leaders have said they will submit to FDA by year end, lure investors by pipe dreams and false forward looking statements. The future delays of FDA will happen by year end in their evading FDA trial as it could mean they are trying to avoid the real question. Are executives reusing a failed FDA vaccine in 2016 FDA trials, to now give as global sales, secondly, did 30 percent of the workforce get laid off? Now, do we have poor quality vaccine made in India manufacturing that will not make product until next year with no clarity to when orders will actually start being sent out?

The company is at a crossroads. The multiple competitors with Merck pills, Pfizer pills and Tamiflu pills a approved antiviral. Last question is Covavax vaccine time running out, another high-profile stumble could crush the company?

In short, Novavax drawing the ire of investors that bought this stock watching prices skip around like rock over lake. Unfortunately, it's commonplace for Novavax to be struggling to meet the quality standards. Until later, it might be best to simply watch this developmental-stage biotech from the safety of the sidelines.

My investor rank was 2,000. Today, post $RIVN IPO (I participated) I am at a 60% gain overall. My rank dropped to 4,000, though. This tells me an insane number of users came to SOFI to participate in the Rivian IPO! Not only did Sofi crush earnings last quarter, I think we havent seen anything yet! 

With the bank charter imminent, exploding user growth this current quarter (Q4) due to Galileo, new investment options (cant say per rules but it rhymes with blypto) and Rivian IPO, earnings should be a breeze in 3 months. In Q1 of 2021 their core business will explode when student loan payments will resume. Loan growth in this area is less than 50% of last year due to deferrals from the CARES Act.

I truly believe this will be a winner for at least the next 6-12 months and I hope you all have already been layering in like me. I will continue to keep my recurring investment because this will go to the moon.

1,"11/12/2021, 08:55:28","COVAVAX as the long-awaited FAILURE. Buy Puts Novavax, read why.",Mundane-Knowledge-87,"Buy Puts Novavax now, here is why,

The covavax NVAX protein spike vaccine and MRNA vaccine to induce heart inflammation and severity warrants concern, especially with the adverse events to cause myocarditis and pericarditis. The number of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis reported with the vaccines in the UK remains to continue to closely affect more young adults these events reported in the UK and internationally. Heart inflammation is a complication seen to stop heart beat. Novavax will almost certainly fall short of its hopes to position with COVAVAX as the long-awaited FAILURE to their other failed product Synagis, leaving the market for competitors to have market share. The clinical update expecting, Novavax, vaccine ongoing study show in pregnant women to make issues with birth as it showed similar results on animal experiments by NIH and BARPA scientists.

Novavaxs failed vaccine trial last covid outbreak in 2016 and the event was devastating to the stock price as if someone was in the final week of construction on a dream home only to have a natural disaster blow through and knock the top floors down.  Company has 2/2 failed virus events in the prior Covid in 2006 &amp; 2017, and we are now on the third event.  Hatrick?

After year and half with no federal fast regulatory track, Novavax Inc. executives, led by CEO Stan Erck, had to relay a painful message to investors multiple times since 2020: Their vaccine candidate meant to protect DOESNT work, little known of side effects as UK submission may not even be certified as acceptable, this could be the reason their not filing for a vaccine trial in United States possibly pushing back dates to end of year to reschedule to later unknown date once again.  Covavax product had poured billions of tax payers dollars in this process since 2020  hadnt come close to meeting targets in its vaccine trials and has aligned the pockets of the insiders with $100,000,000 in selling of their companies stock.

Investors devastatingly could see its stock shed 70 percent of its value within day, with the stock low float and 60 percent owned by few large investors. Its leaders have said they will submit to FDA by year end, lure investors by pipe dreams and false forward looking statements. The future delays of FDA will happen by year end in their evading FDA trial as it could mean they are trying to avoid the real question. Are executives reusing a failed FDA vaccine in 2016 FDA trials, to now give as global sales, secondly, did 30 percent of the workforce get laid off? Now, do we have poor quality vaccine made in India manufacturing that will not make product until next year with no clarity to when orders will actually start being sent out?

The company is at a crossroads. The multiple competitors with Merck pills, Pfizer pills and Tamiflu pills a approved antiviral. Last question is Covavax vaccine time running out, another high-profile stumble could crush the company?

In short, Novavax drawing the ire of investors that bought this stock watching prices skip around like rock over lake. Unfortunately, it's commonplace for Novavax to be struggling to meet the quality standards. Until later, it might be best to simply watch this developmental-stage biotech from the safety of the sidelines.

1,"11/12/2021, 08:43:20",$GOEV - Canoo Earnings Report Speculative Play,Forestur,"**I'ma try an' keep this short an' sweet.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not gonna go in-depth about Canoo as a company. If you're on WSB then you've probably heard of Canoo. Regardless we all just throw money around any way, so fuck it, if you really give a shit then do some research.  

&amp;#x200B;

To cut to the chase, Canoo is having its' Earnings Report next Monday (11/15/2021). Because Canoo is a newer EV company they obviously don't have any true earnings to announce. The idea is that Tony Aquila (CEO of Canoo) will use this call to drop some good news. But will he drop news? and if so, what? 

&amp;#x200B;

**That's where the true speculation begins.** 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of information has been leaked that Tony Tequila has not commented on or has barely acknowledged and is not priced-in. The next logical thought process is; What information does Tony Tequila have that hasn't been leaked yet? Will Tony Tequila comment on any of the leaked information or release any new information? 

  

Well, what I'm saying, is that there are known-knowns and that there are known-unknowns. But there's also unknown-unknowns; things we don't know that we don't [know.](https://youtu.be/2msQwpzatQc?t=23) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's some known-knowns that hasn't received a lot of press and has barely moved the stock price:**

\- Canoo announcing battery supply agreement with Panasonic

\- Canoo's attendance of the Certified Pest Control Operators of Georgia's 23rd annual conference

\- An insane amount of new hires including people from Nio, Tesla, Harley Davidson, etc.

\- Canoo partnership with VDL Nedcar to manufacture vehicles 

\- Canoo's MPDV nominated for Red Dot Design Award

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's some of the known-unknowns that Canoo hasn't commented on or has barely acknowledged:**

\- Pictures of the new sedan (leaked, unannounced)

\- Frontdoor Collective ordering 10,000 delivery vans by 2024 from Canoo (barely acknowledged, hardly any press)

\- [AirAsia](https://i.imgur.com/WpY2qVX.png) partnering with Canoo for its' new rideshare program (YouTube video uploaded by AirAsia then made private soon after)

\-Tony Aquila's Form 4 showing him become a majority shareholder in the company 

&amp;#x200B;

**Unkown-unkowns?**

\- Who the fuck does know. Looking at the past knowns, it could be anything (Canoo-Apple partnership? /s)

The obvious idea behind unknown-unknowns is that Tony ""butt fuck"" Tequila could release information that hasn't been leaked that no one knows of. 

**A little bonus spice:**

Now I want to make it clear that this is mostly an earnings play. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I can't leave out the the insane volume of open interest for the 11/19 calls. Currently there are 56,598 options that are currently OTM. 17,069 of them are for the $10 strike. Current stock price as of writing this is is around $8.50. If the 10 strike calls get close to being ITM then GOEV could go parabolic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to reiterate, this is not a sQueEze play, this is speculation on the Earnings Report being received well by the market. But the fact that OTM OI is so high, could help this stock fly. Just an added bonus. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Canoo ($GOEV) will release some big news that makes the market excited for the company. When big news then big moves. High OI make stock fly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will add links for proof to the above claims in a comment below. Auto-mod is a bitch.

**WHAT IS CRCT IS THIS A PENNIE? $6bn market cap**

Nope, it's a manufacture/tech company in the printing, cutting, crafting and design space. They also sell software/subscriptions, and materials for creators and small business owners.

If you've heard of ETSY, literally every ETSY business owner will know what a Cricut is and probably 1:4 owns one.

Recently they launched into EMEA and APAC as well, they are an industry leader in the craft and diy space. I can see why Abdiel thinks they have found deep value and invested as an early adopter.

If they do capture the market share in the next Q4 with EBITDA increased that's probably how they are estimating a 50% increase in EPS.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The real question is. How do you cover 4.6million shares with:

\- half the amount of time

\- low volume

\- low liquidity

\- high bid/ask spread

\- 122% float wtf

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**SSRCase** for CRCT:

11/12 is a **shortened trading day** which normally means low volume or **less volume** due to participants being absent from the market.

Strong Insider Ownership and many shares not issued yet for public trading. (**Low Float means more volatility**)

99% of the float is owned by institutions. (**The longs whovalue invest**)

22% of the float last reported is shorted (**The ENTIRE 22% is borrowed**)

SSR triggered (drop of over 10%, tomorrow the stock is most definitely **shortsale restricted)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick Maths:**

20.80m shares \* 22.43%  = **4.6million shares** are **borrowed**

Spread for buying shares are around 0.20 - 0.50, **high spread means price action since low liquidity**

**99% float owned, + 22.43% owned** = &gt; 100% (?**Naked**)

&amp;#x200B;

**BEST CASE SCENARIO TO COVER**

The average day size of CRCT is at a $2 movement. Means that for every **$2 moved you find an average** of a shares transacted .

\- This assumptions means that for every **$2 moved you are able to cover the average amount of shares in a flat market.**

The **average trading volume is 642,000** across all days for CRCT.

This means at **7x** the volume all positions closed and the **price moves around $14** (Suspiciously close to the **$36** previous top. (?Coincidence that some sells have been already set there?)

&amp;#x200B;

**WORST Spread Case with no Sellers:**

Let's assume you are able to purchase 1000 shares on the ask before it flips up a ticker of 0.25.

\- This is common for low liquidity stocks with buy demand, might be conservative.

**Not accounting for competing volume**, autists who want to smash your pp into a square.

4.6m in an upwards direction would be 4600 \*0.25 or $1150 price movement to **$1170**

&amp;#x200B;

**Middle scenario:**

**$600 -** add and divide.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions to ask yourself:**

How do you cover 4.6million shares with:

\- half the amount of time

\- low volume

\- low liquidity

- Altimeter Growth is a SPAC merging with Grab, a Singaporean company that calls itself a combination of Uber, Doordash, PayPal, Venmo, and Bank of America all in one (their motto is The Everyday Everything App)
- Located in 8 countries in one of the fastest growing regions in the world, Southeast Asia
- 41M float
- 83% institutionally owned (Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and more)
- 40% shorted
- NO SHARES AVAILABLE TO BORROW
- Stock price up from $12 to $17 over the past 3 days
- ATH of $18.11 which we are fast approaching

The merger between AGC and Grab will be happening Q4 2021, and this morning they basically confirmed the announcement of the merger could be any day now once the SEC gives them the green light.

As the merger announcement approaches, so does the hype.

Social media/ online gaming is going to overtake FB and Twitter in the coming years in ad revenue. These games already have the engagement of the next generation. Ad revenue will follow. RBLX already proved that and I got paid handsomely for my $80c I bought last Friday before earnings. I commented this play in the daily on Friday so I had proof I called it early. Few if any believed me. 

RBLX has already run and seen impressive gains but its not the only one. Some of them have earnings coming up and could possibly go up even more due to cap size which is why I wont share my specific play. 

This whole sector ran today some having 20%-40% gains but I dont think its over yet. ( I kinda already called todays gains sort of by accident, I knew this sector was going to run but I didnt think it would happen til next week. Today surprised me so I figured Id rush this out before the weekend. Proof is in the link to my comments last night) If you dont believe just downvote and move on. If you want to hear more Ill hang out in the comments and try to elaborate on specific questions you might have. 

I will not share my ticker because its against wsb rules. The best I can do is add a link to my comments predicting todays action where u might b able to figure it out. My intention isnt to spam my play. Mine is solid I dont need to for it to pay out. My reason for this post was to point out the possibilities here so you all can search yourselves and find the right plays there are plenty of them. 

If it was me Id look for ones that havent had earnings yet recently. FDs are back on the menu. Happy hunting.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* After a selloff in the previous session due to expectations that high inflation might necessitate tighter monetary policy, US shares gave back their gains on Thursday.
* The S&amp;P500 rose less than 0.1%, powered by advances in materials and technology, after plunging 0.8% on Wednesday, its largest drop in more than a month. Tesla Inc. changed after papers revealed that CEO Elon Musk liquidated $5 billion in stock. Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co. and Beyond Meat Inc. both fell after reporting disappointing quarterly results.
* The US cash treasury market was closed for a holiday.
* Investors are ready for monetary policy adjustments sooner rather than later, as higher-than-expected consumer prices have delivered a setback to assertions that inflation is transitory. Inflationary pressures may drive the Fed to taper at a faster rate or raise interest rates sooner than expected if inflation remains high. Simultaneously, equities are nearing all-time highs as robust earnings and economic growth prospects force the stock market higher.
* Oil struggled to find a direction as investors assessed the likelihood that the White House would interfere to cool prices. Gold was approaching a five-month high. Stocks rose in Europe, while Chinese equities rose in Asia on anticipation that the government will lessen its standoff with property developers. The dollar was stronger against its major counterparts.

1,"11/12/2021, 06:26:25",BGFV: The Second Cumming is NEARLY Here,lukaszdw,"Welcome back players of the squid game. If you have been following this series with tight hands on your shares since I posted the original DD... congratulations. You have nearly passed the second game in this squid game. This squid game has three games... listen up. For all those who have fallen RIP.

So what is happening? If you have been watching the charts, volume and looking at the order book you will have seen that throughout the last few days we have been getting massive green dildos randomly throughout the day. Today one of those was at $42.10 (103k shares) but the real kahunas came near close (800k+ shares), pushing the price over $46.00+.

You might be asking why? Under further inspection is looks like this is a bit of a market anomaly. It may be due to one of two catalysts from a market perspective.

1. Long holders are recalling their shares for tax reasons (dividend paid and taxed as dividend) BUT if they let the shorts pay them, that dividend is taxed as income (higher taxes = institutions wont like that). This has happened with $IGIC a low float deSPAC which saw its shares rally from $8 to $90 briefly.
2. Brokers are getting really fucking nervous with the positive momentum, and force closing positions as a defensive measure. No broker wants to be in HUGE unrealized losses if this bad boy squeezes to $100+.

You might remember, the second cumming? As it was told in the last post I had mentioned this:

\- positive momentum to continue

BIG FUCKING CHECK

\- potential margin calls

BIG FUCKING CHECK

So far, this play is trending in the right direction, but its far from over. CTB is still low, but we have finally exhausted every share available to be borrowed.

In the next game we have a run up on the options chain forcing call writers to buy to hedge, further momentum + margin calls.

Today is Nov. 11, and if institutions continue to recall their shares to get paid the dividend then we will continue to see massive blocks of shorts needing to cover.

TLDR; it ain't over yet.

Now the third cumming... that's the final blow

Now that we have $60C for Nov. 19, if we can get those in the green would mean about 4M shares would need to be delivered by T+2... There are only 20M shares out there in the public. Have you ever seen anyone try and buy 20% of the float to be delivered? Good luck. If the shorts are STILL holding by then, that will be their endgame.

So far the shortage has cost 2.2 Million vehicles. That could just be a tiny fraction if Taiwan has more serious future issues such as natural disasters or a China invasion, which could cost businesses TRILLIONS in damages to companies such as:  Ford (F) , General Motors (GM) , and Toyota (TM), Dell Technologies (DELL),  Apples (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), AMD, NVDA, and many more.


&gt;The group, which also includes the governors of auto-producing states like Alabama, said the shortage had cost automakers 2.2 million vehicles and affected 575,000 jobs in the industry.

&gt;The semiconductor funding passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year by 68-32 as part of the broader U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA. But it has not passed the House of Representatives.



https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nine-governors-press-us-lawmakers-pass-semiconductor-funding-bill-2021-11-10/

Much of this funding plus possibly more in the future, seems likely to go to Intel (INTC).

The ROOT volcano woke up from its slumber and began to erupt, and in the coming days it will cover with lava all the shorters that have destroyed this stock in the last 8 months.

Root has grown dramatically today after the announcement of the financial results, with a considerable increase in revenue to 204 M (v.s 170 M estimates) and an EPS of - 0.53 (v.s. - 0.69 estimates). Today's volume has been the highest since the launch of Root and I am glad that many investors have started to realize the potential of ROOT. This is not just a simple insurance company, it is a game changer in the insurance industry, it is also a technology company in the first place

And this is just the beginning ... The partnership with Carvana $CVNA will develop in the 4th quarter, and many cars sold by Carvana will have an advantageous Root insurance package, and Root sales will double ...

I am glad that Root will shut the mouths of many who blamed this company, Root being one of the most sorted (48% SI) shares in the last 8 months, making the share decrease by 83% (from 27$ to  4.60$ ) .... Root has been permanently attacked and sabotaged because it is the first tech insurance company which revolutionize the insurance market, and this has bothered many ...

We are also waiting for the partnership with Tesla $TSLA, which after a long time managed to authorize its own insurance (similar to Root) only in one state (Texas). Elon, instead of wasting years with permits in all states, you can turn to Root because in 2022 they will have coverage all over the USA !!!

Also yesterday, Root announced the initiation of a discussion with BlackRock for a financing line, in this way Root will develop more and will preserve the cash he has now (approximately 1 billion).

I estimate that Root after Q4 will reach  30$ per share, and starting with Q1 2022 it is possible to see the first quarterly profit, and Root will explode over 50$ per share .....

We have to get rid of these shorts these days and put Root on the right and deserved path !!!

How to lose 5k on an options trade. 

Step 1 -  Buy 20 contracts a 2.01 per contract (4k) with an exp date of 1/20/2023

Step 2 - Check the next day and see that 4k is now worth 5.9k

Step 3 - Sell the contracts to close the option at a gain of 1.9k

Step 4 - The most crucial step in losing the money so pay attention.  Forget to look at the spread and set your price. 

Step 5 - Assume you got the price for the 1.9k gain i.e. selling the contracts for 5.9K and hit the sell button

Step 6 - Notice you only got like $500 for selling. 

Step 7 - Wait 1.5 hrs and call TD Ameritrade and they tell you the spread was  .26 - 4.5. The market maker gave you .26 per contract since you didn't specify the price... aka 26 cents per contract 

Step 8 - Tell your wife's boyfriend in joking way when he gets home and you have prepared dinner for them.  

Step 9 - Shake it off , laugh about it, keep going, and learn from this silly mistake ( also TDAmeritrade is going to try to talk to the market maker lol because they said ""you got boned"")",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrvhd0/how_to_lose_5k_by_not_paying_attention/

1,"11/12/2021, 05:12:22",I analyzed $SOFI so you don't have to,Jodyhighrolex,"SOFI Technologies, Inc. is an online personal finance company. They provide a range of lending and wealth management services. At the time of this post, they are trading at about $23.65. They released earnings for Q3 on November 10. They reported Revenue of $272.01 million for the 3rd quarter of 2021 which is a 35.5% increase from the same prior-year period. SoFi beat estimates by $16.38M. Furthermore, they added 377,000 new members which is the second-highest quarterly increase in the company's history. That being said, SoFi looks to be a potential buy. Not convinced yet? Here are some other reasons why I believe SoFi is a good company to buy into. 

1. SoFis total members grew 96% Year-over-Year. Part of the reason why this occurred is because the products they offer have doubled Year-over-Year. The company beat Revenue Expectations, Earnings Per Share, almost doubled their member growth Year-over-Year and began offering way more products. Most people can find a product that suits them through SoFis financial services. In Quarter 3, they did a great job at  demonstrating their ability to capture market share. 
2. SoFi has increased the amount of marketing theyve been doing. Theyve been working with influencers across Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and Tik Tok. Which has driven an additional 400 Million impressions and 775K engagements with SoFi content. SoFi has been investing a lot in their marketing strategy and attempts to acquire customers which has obviously translated into very great results. By the looks of it, SoFi has started to get creative in adopting additional customers. These new strategies could help boost the company by a lot. 
3. In relation to their valuation, SoFi experienced strong growth which was driven by the growth of users they had experienced and the products they offer, especially in the personal loans sector. Right now, the company looks like its trading at a decent price in comparison with other companies in this sector. If the company can somehow increase their Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization over the years coming, they could see its multiples inflate.

If youve made it this far into this post youre probably asking yourself, Are there any risks involved with investing in this company? Like any investment, there is always a risk. Despite the fact that SoFi reported a strong quarter, they need to show that they can keep up their strength. The stock continuing to go up will be contingent on continued success and an increase in profitability over the future quarters. That being said, I wouldnt say this is a strong buy, but a potential one. It could be a great buy if it dips again. However, This company is currently trading at reasonable multiples. 

Thanks for reading everyone! If you have any questions let me know in the comments below or feel free to message me! I hope this helped you figure out whether or not to buy into SoFi. Also, feel free to check out my profile and see the analysis I did on Digital Turbine AKA $APPS.

Ticker: RELY

Ive   been meaning to write this DD for a while, and with Remitlys first quarterly earnings meeting having just concluded and the ensuing  price drop I believe right now is one of the best times for entry in this  hidden gem. While I dont believe this is going to explode on some  large catalyst, I believe theres an opportunity here for a movement to   the $45-50 levels in the next few months. We're currently sitting at a  strong support around $30. This is a fairly short and simple DD because there isn't anything crazy going on here, just a stock I believe to be trading at a tasty discount.

**Who is Remitly?**

Remitly is a recently IPOd company that handles international  remittances. Remittance refers to transfer of money by foreign migrants  to their   home countries. It consists of several channels such as banks,  money  transfer operators, mobile network operators, and others.  Remittance   has increased massively in recent years due to businesses  involved with  customers &amp; clients working overseas. The opportunity here is huge, there are over 280 million immigrants and the global  remittance market exceeds $1.5T annually.

Main competitors include Western Union as well as MoneyGram.  However 90% of Remitlys business is driven by digital methods,  compared to 20% at these dinosaurs. Remitlys users absolutely love the  product  their app on Google Play has 285,000 reviews with a 4.8/5  rating.

RELY is currently trading  close to 40% off its IPO highs. The only  news that has come out about   Remitly since the IPO has been the  announcement of a partnership with   Facebook on their NOVI wallet to  power cash pickup in Guatemala. I  consider this type of partnership  neutral/bullish but it seems to have  been taken negatively by the market  given all the negative sentiment around Meta. I still do not believe that this drop is in any way warranted

Remitly announced their Q3 2021 earnings on November 10 after market close.

* Revenue totaled $121.2 million, compared to $71.8 million, up 69% (giggidy) year over year.
* Net  loss was $13.0 million, compared to $2.4 million net loss. The  increase in Remitlys net loss was primarily due to the $6.9 million    non-cash donation of common stock in connection with their Pledge 1%  commitment, as well as incremental stock-based compensation expense.
* Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $0.3 million, compared to $0.6 million.
* Send volume increased to $5.2 billion, from $3.2 billion, up 61% year over year.
* Active customers increased to 2.6 million, from 1.7 million, up 51% year over year.
* Average revenue per active customer increased 12% year over year to $47.34.

**Analyst Coverage**

Analysts have been generally quite bullish about the stock, with an  average   price target of $51, representing a \~65% upside form the current  price   of $30.

1,"11/12/2021, 04:46:34",Absolutely Stupid IDEA that for some reason has printed me MONEY,ComprehensiveSky1993," Michael Saylor has effectively turned MSTR into a stock market play on BT C. This has allowed Institutional investors with limited access to cry pto markets to gain exposure to BT C. The institutional interest in cry pto is clear and can be seen in the sheer number of institutions from BlackRock to vanguard Morgan Stanley and even State Street who are holding MSTR on their balance sheets. Buying MSTR as a bet on the increase in price in BT C could generate incredible returns if BT C were to appreciate. However, what interests me most about MSTR is not its potential BT C returns but the incredibly expensive price of options on this stock. When looking at options an important factor to consider is the amount of leverage on the contract. For example, on a typical stock like AMZN purchasing an option contract at the money for roughly a year out currently costs approximately 350 USD this is a leverage of about 10x. But When trading Options on MSTR a similar at the money call option with roughly a year till expiration runs about 250 USD leverage of roughly 3x. What this means is if you are selling options contracts the premium you collect from traders is roughly 3x higher relative to the cost of the stock you would be holding in order to cover yourself. The reason for this is due to a variety of contributing factors but the most likely would be that the implied volatility on MSTR is much higher than the implied volatility on AMZN. In addition to this, there are fewer traders who feel comfortable holding MSTR stock in order to sell covered Calls compared to AMZN as they themselves dont feel confident in the future performance of BT C leading to overall less supply of calls on the market and higher premium. When creating a strategy to profit from this high option's premium another interesting trend comes to mind and that is the sharp increase in retail trading leading to a juristic increase in the number of short-term options being purchased on highly speculative and volatile stocks like MSTR. Yes, I am talking about the wall street bets Croud and similar investors who use the stock market to bet large amounts of money at high leverage on short-term calls. In 2020 single stock options volumes have increased 3x on a year over year basis the increase is heavily concentrated in short term as in less than 2-week calls. If we take this data into consideration, it would make the most sense to sell the shortest-term options, we can on MSTR in order to profit on the highest premium relative to time as time decays fastest toward the end of an options contract. The only factor to consider is your personal risk tolerance and belief in BT C but given the current dominance of modern monetary policy leading to excessive money printing globally as well as the rapid adoption similar to that of the internet in the 90s there is definitely a case to be made that cry pto is at least here to stay and if you believe it is then MSTR options present a very nice way of profiting where other investors are too fearful to hold MSTR",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrumax/absolutely_stupid_idea_that_for_some_reason_has/

Ticker: RELY

Ive been meaning to write this DD for a while, and with Remitlys  first quarterly earnings meeting having just concluded and the ensuing  price drop I believe right now is one of the best times for entry in  this hidden gem. While I dont believe this is going to explode on some  large catalyst, I believe theres an opportunity here for a movement to  the $45-50 levels in the next few months. We're currently sitting at a strong support around $31.

**Who is Remitly?**

Remitly is a recently IPOd company that handles international  remittances. Remittance refers to transfer of money by foreign migrants  to their home countries. It consists of several channels such as banks,  money transfer operators, mobile network operators, and others.  Remittance has increased massively in recent years due to businesses  involved with customers &amp; clients working overseas. The opportunity  here is huge, there are over 280 million immigrants and the global  remittance market exceeds $1.5T annually.

Main competitors include Western Union (WU) as well as MoneyGram  (MGI). However 90% of Remitlys business is driven by digital methods,  compared to 20% at these dinosaurs. Remitlys users absolutely love the  product  their app on Google Play has 285,000 reviews with a 4.8/5  rating.

RELY is currently trading close to 40% off its IPO highs. The only  news that has come out about Remitly since the IPO has been the  announcement of a partnership with Facebook on their NOVI wallet to  power cash pickup in Guatemala. I consider this type of partnership  neutral/bullish but it seems to have been taken negatively by the market  given all the negative sentiment around Meta. I still do not believe  that this drop is in any way warranted

Remitly announced their Q3 2021 earnings on November 10 after market close.

&amp;#x200B;

* Revenue totaled $121.2 million, compared to $71.8 million, up 69% (giggidy) year over year.
* Net loss was $13.0 million, compared to $2.4 million net loss. The  increase in Remitlys net loss was primarily due to the $6.9 million  non-cash donation of common stock in connection with their Pledge 1%  commitment, as well as incremental stock-based compensation expense.
* Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $0.3 million, compared to $0.6 million.
* Send volume increased to $5.2 billion, from $3.2 billion, up 61% year over year.
* Active customers increased to 2.6 million, from 1.7 million, up 51% year over year.
* Average revenue per active customer increased 12% year over year to $47.34.

I've been looking into Lordstown motors. $Ride just signed a deal with Foxx Con to make their Electric vehicles, that shot up their stock 20% today. Now they have earnings after hours  today and I'm sure they'll expand on the deal and paint a rosey picture. What excites me about this is 

1) They have a $1b market cap, making it the cheapest EV maker out there besides WKHS, but WKHS lost their bid a year ago and has been in purgatory since, where as RIDE actually plans to make vehicles and now has a solid deal to do so.

2) Even the con artists in NKLA have a $5B market cap. By comparison, $RIDE would need to be at $30 a share to have the same cap. 

3) RIDE has a 30% short interest. Making this stock highly squeezable. 

Now a normal person so convicted would buy $2000 worth of shares and RIDE this bitch to the moon on a donkey. As i mentioned in my first sentence though, I'm not a normal person. I'm a coke sniffing, stock gambling SOB with an addiction to tendies. I have $1000 in $10 calls expiring tomorrow and $1000 in $12 calls expiring next week.

1,"11/12/2021, 04:19:43","AMD DD, my marathon winner",seigy,"I'veread nothing but great news and strong upgrades over the past week or so regarding AMD. I knowAMD just had a great run however, I'm here to tell you that run has only just got started with this recent jump. I am a semi and semi-cap equipment bull and foreseeanother 10+ years of extremely strong growth for both. As this relates to AMD inparticular, the most importantpoint is that whileAMD (and NVDA) have been growing strong both due to organic market growth and eating into INTC position. Both of these trends will also be continuing for many years thanks to increases in EVs, ""metaverse""/web 2.0 &amp; 3.0/omniverse, IoT, digital coins/tokens, always on wearable medical devices, AR/VR. Yes, I know the Intel fanboys are screaming over all the great things Pat is doing, I too hold a little Intel however, it will take many years to turn the ship and he is then wanting to turn that ship to fight on all three fronts with TSM, AMD, and NVDA - good luck.

Simply looking at the pie of existing market share we see that there is a big ol' pieceof pie there that Intel still has but is being eaten away by AMD more quickly every year.

Revenue (TTM)
AMD $14.9B as of 09/30/2021
NVDA $21.9Bas of07/31/2021
INTC $78.5Bas of09/30/2021

Forward EPS Long Term Growth (3-5 Yrs) 
AMD 35.32% 09/30/2021
NVDA 32.60% 07/31/2021
INTC 3.16% 09/30/2021

With both AMD and NVDAprojecting great forward EPS, the main reasonI am more bullish on AMD is that the majority of Intel's revenue comes from CPUs in PCs and data centers -&gt; AMD is the predatorhere and continues to eat away at this huge cash pie.

Last note, AMD just entered a Wave 5-Bullish Elliott Wave on 11/9/21.

As you can see [here,](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/business/wendys-new-french-fries/index.html) Wendy's has adjusted the cut of the potatoes and begun leaving some skin on, as well as changing their batter. Having tasted these myself, I can confirm this is undoubtedly an improvement of epic proportions. You now have another reason to go to Wendy's besides hanging out by the dumpster.

Additionally, Wendy's has a [guarantee that they will replace your french fries](https://www.foodandwine.com/news/wendys-crispy-fries-replacement-deal-free-food) if they fail to meet the hot 'n crispy standards. What more can you ask for?

Beyond the new and improved french fries, $WEN still has a lot of the same things going for it as a few months ago. I will link a fellow redditor's [DD here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nudcrm/to_the_guy_who_recommended_wendys_stockwen_proper/) for your review.

I don't know what more you can ask for that hot 'n crispy fries, a dumpster to hang out behind, and a company that loves to roast people on social media.

TLDR: Wendy's french fries make stock go boom.

I reinvested it into Bit coin and some PLTR and held onto 113 GME shares. In order to hold onto my sanity from the volatility of these investments, I told myself that this is just a game, it's not real money it's just points. Now here I am, looking at my portfolios feeling guilty. Why am I fortunate enough to have this happen to me. Why do people work 9-5s their entire lives to earn money when I earned more trading this year than I could've earned, had I been working for 10 years.

What has happened:

In September and October multiple interest payments were missed by Evergrande only to be paid off in the 11th hour when a deal was struck to offer alternate payments. The details of this deal were/are still unknown.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-evergrande-makes-overdue-interest-payment-on-dollar-bonds-state-media-says-11634869419


A German company by the name of DMSA (https://www.dmsa-agentur.de/) purchased $ bonds from Evergrande to provide transparency as to the validity of these payments. 


Whats happening:

On 10/10 Evergrande met the limit of their grace period to make payments on these dollar bonds, and thus was no longer protected from litigious reproach. 


DMSA, who is claiming they have not received payment, moved forward with default proceedings stating not only that they did not get paid, but they expect Evergrande to be insolvent within days of the proceedings.  See press release for details : https://www.dmsa-agentur.de/download/20211110_DMSA_EVG_PM_en.pdf


After this news Bloomberg along with other Finance News Agencies reported the contrary, that these payments were intact made. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/evergrande-said-to-pay-delayed-interest-on-at-least-two-bonds



Where  we are now:

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dr-marco-metzler-403341163_evergrande-has-officially-defaulted-german-activity-6864475010753404928-Gqak

The managing founder of DMSA has reached out via LinkedIn claiming Bloomberg is lying, and is / has been mis reporting the potentially invalid claims that payments have been made.

I e-mailed DMSA to follow up and received the following response. 

Hello Redacted,
please follow the latest news from Dr Marco Metzler on linkedin. There is no more information right now.
Best regards 
Inga

So as of right now, the creditor who has stated and sought legal reproach from Evergrande has stuck to their guns and is continuing to say Evergrande has defaulted. 


Personal opinion: 

Lots of high level bullshittery is happening  and Bloomberg may be complicit in a financial cover up if they are intentionally misrepresenting the facts.


TL:DR: Evergrande HAS defaulted, until DMSA/ the courts say otherwise.

1,"11/12/2021, 04:04:18",Calling All Apes: Understanding and Profiting from our Current Inflationary Environment,StockTipsTips,"Inflation is a persistent issue coming out of the COVID lockdown economy and continues to create a great amount of confusion for the retail investor space. Many retail traders don't know what it means or how to respond. More specifically, many are having trouble with tailoring their portfolios to either avoid risk or take advantage of inflationary circumstances. I aim to somewhat remedy this. I hope the pointers below will help you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. This is not the end all or be all and I welcome your observations and comments on what I could have missed. Enjoy this and lets make some money taking advantage of these once in a lifetime economic circumstances.

* **Inflations is Measured by a Change in Rate:** Inflation doesn't usually go down. The RATE of inflation goes up or down, but inflation itself is persistent. This is by design. Could you imagine what would happen to the economy if you knew that your dollar would be worth more tomorrow than it is today? Spending on goods other than necessities would come to a very dramatic reduction. So it is important to understand that what we are looking at is the CHANGE IN RATE of inflation. There is no deflation!! Deflation is 1000x worse for the economy than inflation. So do not expect deflation. The Fed simply will not allow it. Nor should they!
* **Current Inflation is Largely a Result of too Much Demand:** During the COVID lock downs many businesses were forced to grind their operations to a halt. Remember food, toilet paper, &amp; other essentials flying off the shelves? Indeed many grocery stores were limiting the amount of water you could buy. It only stands to reason that when you force businesses to close down you create a situation where the goods that people demand are not being replaced by a steady supply. So what happens as the economy opens back up? Suddenly those same businesses have reduced inventories, they need to hire back workers, they need to order new supplies, &amp; they need to meet an increased demand as a result of some competitors closing their doors for good. Now the quantity of goods demanded well exceeds the quantity of goods supplied ... on all fronts. Reopening firms are competing against other reopening firms for the same raw materials, supplies, resources, shipping, etc. They are also competing for the same labor pool. Remember that goods &amp; services in times of extreme scarcity go to the highest bidder.
   * **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand (Or too Little Supply):** Below you will find the inflationary issues we find ourselves in as a result of increased demand and limited supply. Below each topic you will also find some examples of how to profit from each. You will also receive some examples of secondary and tertiary effects of each.
      * **Supply Chain Bottlenecks:** First and foremost in the news are the supply chain bottlenecks. We've all seen the ships floating off the Port of Los Angeles, or the very long line of trucks waiting to pick up freight from the ports. The United States &amp; Europe have but a limited number of ports and they're taking on all the supplies that firms ordered as the economy opened back up. Making things worse ... its holiday shopping season. So cost of shipping dry bulk overseas is not just rising as a result of increased demand, but as a result of the fact that it costs money to have all these carriers waiting weeks to offload their goods. Making matters worse many of the imported goods are perishables which can spoil and reduce the supply of foodstuffs amid an already high demand. As a result many firms are opting for alternative methods of shipping like the much more expensive option of air freight. **(*****Note: Moderately bullish on sea freight carriers, rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**
      * **Supply Chain Shortages:** As if the bottlenecks weren't bad enough, there are but a limited number of domestic shipping firms. Firms that not only transport materials to businesses, or, finished goods to retailers, but also delivering orders to retail shoppers. Here we are once again talking about rail, trucking, mail delivery, air freight, logistics firms, logistics outsourcing, etc. So yet again we have an increased demand for shipping and logistics with but a limited supply. And while this demand will keep up for some time, many firms know it will eventually come back down to normal, and therefore, are very hesitant to expand too fast too quickly for fear that they will one day have too much fleet for future business. **(*****Note: Moderately bullish on rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**
      * **Semiconductor Shortages:** Everything these days has a semiconductor. Whether its semiconductors, passive semiconductors, diodes, you name it, chances are if it was an electronic made in the last 5 years, it needs a semiconductor to properly operate. Indeed before the supply chain shortages hit critical mass, we were dealing with semiconductor shortages. Now we will not likely fix the semiconductor issue until we fix the supply chain issue. Once again as the economy opened back up &amp; demand skyrocketed, semiconductors too experienced a complementary spike in demand. Semiconductors alone are preventing the automakers from producing at full capacity. There are not enough semiconductors to make vehicles. And with the holidays on the horizon semiconductors are in higher demand than ever. Even Sony had to reduce the number of PlayStations they could manufacture and ship due to component shortages and logistics issues. So expect the price of any new electronic device that has a semiconductor to increase in price. **(*****Note: Bullish on electronics &amp; semiconductors*****)**
      * **Vehicle Shortages:** As noted with the semiconductors, vehicles are in short supply. As a result the quantity of vehicles demanded exceed the quantity of vehicles supplied. Therefore we not only have a shortage of vehicles but the price o vehicles have skyrocketed. Have you seen the empty lots at your local dealership? There's nothing to sell! People are ordering direct from factory. As a result people turned toward used vehicles which now are also in short supply. As a result people who could not afford the increased price of used vehicles resulted to maintaining their current vehicles. And as a result of people maintaining their current vehicles, the demand for auto parts &amp; auto mechanics have skyrocketed. And I don't know many large firms that do not need a frequent supply of vehicles to maintain operations. (*Moderately bullish to bullish on used car firms, auto parts, and car repair*)
      * **Raw Material Shortages:** Raw materials were the first to explode out of COVID. Wood, steel, ore, oil, &amp; minerals ... you name it, its all going up. The quantity of supply demanded exceed the current supply ... and for many reasons. **(*****Moderately bullish on miners, steel, mining equipment suppliers, and oil/gas producers ... see energy shortage below for more detail on oil/gas*****)**
      * **Increased Demand for Housing:** Largely as a result of low interest rates incentivizing lending, we experienced a housing and construction boom in the middle of a Pandemic. Houses and industrial builds in many areas have skyrocketed in value. But this was not only as a result of low interest rates. When the federal government instituted a ban on evictions from rental properties, many took advantage by simply not paying their rent. The forgone payments to the landlord forced the renter to pass on the costs on to new tenants, which increased the cost of rental properties beyond that just owning a home in many areas. So people bought homes instead. Moreover many people moved out of urban areas to escape burdensome COVID restrictions which furthermore increased the demand of housing. Furthermore lifetime renting millennials saw the low interest rates as a great time to buy their first home. Finally, mortgage forbearance reduced a lot of foreclosures during COVID. Less foreclosures means less supply, less supply amid high demand results in higher prices. **(Note:** ***Not very bullish on housing &amp; real estate at this time but still moderately bullish on construction, furniture, paint, fixtures, and infrastructure***\*\*).\*\*
      * **Energy Shortages:** As we began to put the COVID economy behind us, more people are travelling to work, to school, and going on vacation. More recently international travel is opening back up.  Moreover firms are expanding rapidly to meet demand and shippers are using more energy than ever. This all of course increases the price of oil, natural gas, jet fuel, and the fuel you pay at the pump. Making matters worse, no matter what your politics are, the current administration in the White House is the most ardently unfriendly domestic coal and fossil fuel administrations we've had in 5 years. OPEC, perhaps realizing that such demand will be but temporary for the next 1-2 years, refuses to entertain the Biden administrations request to ramp up oil supply. Oddly enough big oil hasn't been in this good of a position for the last 4 years where the increase of supply made it seriously hard for oil firms to profit. Energy is used for producing everything. When energy goes up the cost of everything goes up. When energy goes up, people spend more on energy and less on other things. So the increase in energy costs are a result of both increased post COVID demand and politics. Of all the issues we are experiencing with inflated prices, energy is among the easiest to fix. **(Note: B*****ullish on oil, natural gas, oil and natural gas equipment maintainers and suppliers, and perhaps oil exploration if the Biden administration would quit putting up road blocks***\*\*)\*\*
      * **Worker Shortages:** ""Worker Shortages"" is misleading. When people think of a ""worker shortage"" they generally think that we don't have enough workers to meet demand. They would be correct. But we should phrase it as ""firms do not have enough workers to meet CURRENT demand."" Lets face it we are rear view looking creatures. Simply because a firm doesn't have enough workers does not indicate that they cant beat previous profit/revenue, but rather they can not only beat previous revenue projections, but also be in a position where they cannot meet CURRENT demand. And just like anything else, when the quantity of labor demanded exceeds the quantity of labor supplied, we run into increased labor costs ... namely wages. And wages are overwhelmingly the highest cost for most firms. **(Note:** ***Bullish on staffing and outsourcing firms***\*\*)\*\*
   * **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand ... Conclusion:** Lets keep this simple. You want to buy a car. That car is made from raw materials such as aluminum &amp; steel. The car requires electronics. Those electronics require semiconductors. You need a labor force to put that car together. You need energy to manufacture that car. You need truckers &amp; freighters to ship those cars or bring manufacturers the materials to make cars. You need equipment to make cars. In short 100% of the price of all components of that car, or the components used to make that car, have gone up. Still, you have a high demand market where people and businesses require vehicles, but the manufacturer cant meet that demand due to the lack of supplies available. Nevertheless the vehicle manufacturer still needs to pay for overhead costs to keep the doors open. And as so many people are demanding such a short supply of cars, the manufacturers simply increase the price of that car to meet the demand of the highest paying bidders. And this phenomenon is happening in each step of the chain to make that car from the folks who supply the materials, to the folks who produce the energy, to the folks who ship the finished product. When the quantity of goods demanded exceed the quantity of goods supplied, prices necessarily must go up.
* **Monetary Drivers of Inflation:**  As a result of the dramatic initial downward shift in demand amid COVID lockdowns, the Federal Reserve made money cheap, essentially lowering interests rates to both incentivize borrowing and make borrowing more affordable. The result? Massive influxes of borrowing and lending which in turn flooded the economy with cash. At first this excess cash was used to make it through the pandemic. Later this cash was used by firms to expand rapidly to meet demand. People also used cheap money via extremely low interest rates to purchase homes, which increased the demand for housing. Eventually the Fed is going to need to raise interest rates to disincentive lending and cool off a hot economy. If allowed to persist for too long the influx of cash will lead to investments by firms looking to to stave off losing the value of money via inflation and thereby creating a massive bubble. There are already indicators of this happening by virtue of equity valuations in the market. (*Note: the Fed has also been incentivizing investment in the stock market by buying treasury bonds on the secondary market which resulted in keeping the yields artificially low. As a result people were less inclined to buy treasury bonds and more incentivized to invest in other equity*).
* **Government Drivers of Inflation:** The rapid inflation we are experiencing has not deterred President Biden for advocating for trillions in spending measures. The U.S. Government is a customer just like anyone else, and the government competes for the same goods and services you and I do. Increased spending will to some extent result in crowding out the private sector that competes for the same goods and services. Remember that an increase in demand with limited supply generally results increased prices. If the government spends too much, it can seriously hurt consumers in the form of increased prices. Moreover the Biden administration isn't the most friendly administration when it comes to mining for coal, oil, minerals, etc.. This inevitably leads to increased costs of energy and raw materials. (*Note: This comment used a political figure as an example of a negative economic consequence. Do me a favor, take the example for what its worth to you, and realize I am not going to entertain heated political discussion. There is a cost and benefit to everything, and I don't have the time to entertain the talking points you pulled from a political webpage or favorable news site and tell you why you're wrong, when no matter how much the evidence is stacked against you, you're not going to change your mind anyway. Ergo a massive waste of time that benefits no one*).
* **Inflation is Excellent for Debt!:** I will keep this one quick. Lets say you took out a 30 year fixed mortgage in 1990. You paid $90,000 for your home and have a mortgage of $400 per month. In the year 2019 your home is now worth $200,000 in market value but you're still paying $400 per month at a fixed rate. Through inflation your wages have eventually increased while your fixed rate mortgage remained stagnant. In short, you may have been scrimping for pennies when you took out the mortgage, but years later you can make your payment while working at a fast food restaurant. Neat huh? Inflation is excellent for debt ridden companies. As their profit margins increase over time through inflation they will find it much easier to pay off their long term debt. (*Note: Perhaps this put some of the companies you were looking at into better perspective, and if debt was a major factor for not investing, then you may or may not want to revisit your decision.*)
* **Bullish Sectors You Can Profit From that I did not Mention Above:** Industrial Chemicals, Industrial Equipment, Fertilizers, Farm Equipment/Construction, and Pesticides. As firms ramp up production they will increase the demand for industrial chemicals. Moreover, as food prices continue to increase the more land farmers will be incentivized to clear for additional farming which requires more farming construction, farming equipment, chemicals/pesticides, and fertilizers.
* **The Canary in the Inflation Coal Mine:** If the change in prices rise beyond the change in incomes to the point where people need to start economizing their necessities and forgoing their wants, we could be looking at a very serious correction.

**Conclusion:** I hope the pointers above have helped you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. Please understand that I will be reading this over and over again to identify typos &amp; unclear sentences. I may even edit it as people bring ideas to my attention. Anyway I hope you enjoyed it and can turn this into long term investment opportunities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrtptv/calling_all_apes_understanding_and_profiting_from/

I, like you, have sustained a decent amount of loss in my day so I finally started doing my own DD before YOLO-ing my investments and I found one which seems to be a solid shooter (at least from the financial side) so let's talk about it.  


LVOX is a ""next-generation contact center platform"" per their website and currently employs 619 employees across the US and abroad. 

Per the companies most recent 8K ([https://sec.report/CIK/0001723648](https://sec.report/CIK/0001723648)) we have a change (in thousands) of:

THE GOOD:

\- Assets(specifically cash on hand): 18098 to 161423 (791% increase) from 12/31/20

\- Assets(Total): 116858 to 268259 (129% increase YoY)

\- Revenue: 22505 to 28913 from 6/30/20 (25.5% increase YoY)

THE BAD:

\- Operational expenses (R&amp;D, Marketing, Administration): 15140 to 82491 (444% increase YoY)

\- Liabilities(Total): 82717 to 123445 (49% increase)

\- EPS: ($2.20) from $1.03 (313% decrease)

THE HYPE:

\- Earnings report today after hours (11/11/21)

\- U17 Roll out today as well has much friendlier UI to better navigate for customers

\- Increase spending in marketing, sales, and R&amp;D means there is a clear path forward and their new product reflects this ([https://livevox.com/#gref](https://livevox.com/#gref) for reference)

\- They've shown a willingness to set aside funds and keep assets on hand leaving the company with a safety net rather than overextending with their investments

&amp;#x200B;

Why I think it's a safe bet: 

Utilizing AI via chat bots to further aid customer service experience

Investments in marketing and R&amp;D

Insider purchases in last 6 months (6/18: 2 buys @ 1,109,000K shares &amp; 8/17: 1 buy @ 10,000K shares)

52 week variance between 5.50 and 11.43

Earnings report hit hard in June 2021 and caused a downward spike on an otherwise stable company. I see this as an opportunity to dive in while the shares are on sale (Company has been approximately $9.50 to $10.50 range for last 5 years.

I'm open to feedback or suggestions in the comments. More than happy to see other people's DD and where I might be missing something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrto8q/lvox_pennies_to_profits/

Let's pump Farmmi Inc to the moon. At this moment the stock price is not much so we can all buy it and put it higher.

Why? Why not? Why can only people who are very rich say something about a stock and it will fly? Why not a construction worker, postman, clerk, gardener, cleaning lady, ...

And besides, mushrooms to the moon, it sounds nice, isn't it?

I have choosen for 12 november 21 because it is a nice symmetry.

Lets see how strong this community is. Who is with me?

But Monday when they post $138 million vs the $200 million expected for quarter 2. I gave up. I've now sold over 9000 shares and am only holding less than 3000. I've lost over $50,000 in this company holding long. I never got in and out.

Management can't keep using the excuse of declining sales due to macroeconomic factors of Covid anymore. Over the last several years they have also expanded into several other countries. While some might think the extra countries are a great growth opportunity. The revenue isn't showing up from other countries they are expanding into or else the us market is dying.

Personally. I think they charge too much. Twice of what they should be. This is do it yourself not teledentistry. More like $1000 and $1200 with smile pay would be reasonable. Margins might be lower but the amount of customers they have could be 10 times what they are getting now.

Also the company is way over spending on marketing. The TV ads have annoying lady come on and end with a jingle. You never see teeth or the aligners in the ads. But during the next commercial break on Pluto tv Crest has a ad for teeth whitening that shows teeth and whitening being applied during the whole ad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrsivt/sdc_time_to_sell/

So I clicked to see what's going on. It turns out that there's someone trying to bid the vertical spread for 0.16 dollar! Even though the mid price is trading around 1.00 dollar ish. This completely skewed the mid price for the contract which explains why my option suddenly dropped in value. Does anybody know why someone would submit such low bid? Is this a way for the big player to grab cheap spreads since retail might panic sell?

**ROOT** just reported their earning today,  and they surprisingly beat earning which trapped many shorts. These fuckers were Rooting for Root to fail but again... they got caught with their pants down. 

Q3 Earnings  

Revenue: **$93.8M** vs. $67.4M 

EPS: **-$0.53** vs. -$0.70 

Even worse, $ROOT is currently up over 30 percent on the day...... which means shorts are even MORE FUCKED. As you can see, $ROOT is one of the top 10 most shorted stocks in the market right now. I do not believe the SI is 35.93 % I BELIEVEI IT IS WAY HIGHER.

Don't forget that ROOT has a partnership with Carvana. Carvana has a market cap of 50 Billion dollars right now, while ROOT only has a market cap of 1.57 billion. I believe ROOT is undervalued, coupled with the high SI and high DTC,  I have no doubts ROOT will moon. Don't forget to thank me when you get your tendies Retards.

BUT I think people should be aware that this stock has the potential to go to nearly $20 over the year. It's a bit above all time low with 2 or 3 months of solid buying on the chart, got some tail winds from the infrastructure bill, and will likely be responsible for only 1 wildfire this year. 

PCG got it's teeth kicked in around 2018 because of fire liability and fundamental weakness but has improving fundamentals, gov cash coming to help address fire liability, and if we are lucky, a smaller fire season in northern California this year. It was worth about 60-80 dollars in the past and it is not like the utility has lost customers or territory, it just got shit canned, rightfully so, because faulty equipment started major wildfires. It will likely be found responsible for another one this past year but I think the stock really can't go lower unless another entire town burns down like paradise ca did.

1,"11/12/2021, 02:17:04",$CCL Take me to the carnival,sleepystonk123,"What's up you degenerate retards. Here's one for you all. Carnival cruise lines (ticker CCL) has been forming a base for months. After falling from 30 dollar highs it is poised for a surge upwards. If you like to YOLO on calls now is your chance. There is a massive cup and handle pattern forming over several months and it is starting to look interesting. Delta variant is going away and as oral antivirals become approved the leisure and travel industries will bounce. For those not aware, cup and handle formations are some of the most bullish patterns around for stocks. Cyclicals, such as Carnival cruise lines, will outperform as the delta variant continues to fade. 

&amp;#x200B;

I specifically find the December 17, $25 dollar calls and January 15 $27.50 calls to be the most enticing but higher strikes could also be in play. There is big money to be made here for the observant investor.

There are 3 defining features for this pattern:

Cup depth: Clearly defined

Handle formation: Forming on lowering volume as it sells off the retest of a recent high

Cup shape: U-shaped

Thats just how the current market is operating. Miss earnings and youll get killed.

I believe these companies that are losing half their valuation from missed earnings are severely undervalued and will rebound in due time. 

I believe $PSFE will rebound much easier than most other beaten down stock because it was previously a spac traded public at $10. Institutional buyers got in at this price and now were 60% down from there.

Let's dig in. You all know, that 4% of the US workforce quit over ""gains"", be it crypt0, 0DTE SPY calls or whatever thing gave them free money. Now listen, what happens, when inflation further rises, to say 10% or 20% and your cost for heating, food or rent goes up by even more? Well you have to liquidate some of your precious assets. Maybe ETFs, maybe real estate, whatever your girlfriends boyfriend lets you sell.

Now, you quit your job or moved to WFH, because you got so much money from them stonks and now the prices for your favourite banana starts to rise. How long will your money last?

Have you ever heard of the ""The Inelastic Markets Hypothesis""? Well, i saved you a google search, [here is the paper.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3686935) Also i saved you from reading it, this is the main outcome: ""...we find that investing $1 in the stock market increases the markets aggregate value by about $5.""

If now your average ape begins to liquidate, what happens? Right, markets tank. And not just a bit. Let's say 4% start to liquidate, this might be more than enough to trigger a domino effect, which could start the gayest bear market of everything.

TL;DR
Am a gay bear, markets tank due to inelastic markets and 5x effect from liquidations of poortards.

About us:

1. Our chromosome count is in the single digits (combined) so type slowly at us.

2. We like the green crayons because it looks like a vegetable and that is healthier.

3. We have a history of making life altering mistakes and we don't want to break the streak.



What do we want:

1. We want to allow the kids to play with virtual money and show them how the stock market works.

2. We want to have a simplified version that will not overwhelm us. I personally am dumb.

3. We want to teach the kids how to talk and think about the market.

4. We want to teach them basic strategies of buying, selling, researching, etc.


How can you help?

1. Tell me of any resources I can watch/read.

2. Tell me what is essential and what can wait for later.

3. Give me some vocabulary that is important for beginners and dumbed down definitions.

PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) price was beaten down after a series of events and yesterday the CEO has delivered a weak guidance despite announcing the partnership with Amazon. They are well established, and they have a solid track record with big growth potential. With the current price, it offer investor a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially to buy at a lower price.

**I had bought PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and below is my analysis:**

**My analysis for PayPal**

1. The company had **377 million active accounts at the end of 2020, including 29 million merchant accounts**. The company also owns Xoom, an international money transfer business, and Venmo, a person-to-person payment platform.
2. **Positive Earning Trend and debts are well covered.**

Their profit margin have been growing from 5.2% in year 2014 to 20.4% in year 2021. They have grown significantly by an average of 25% per year over the past 5 years.

Last profit margin is 20.1% as at 30 September 2021 with a net income of USD4,997 Millions

High ROE - 23.3% (ROE indicates how well a company's management deploys shareholder capital).

Liabilities - debt to equity ratio of 36% (Total debt 7,949 Million / Total Equity 22,090 Million) as at Sep 30, 2021. *As interest rate is low, it is an excellent strategy to take on more debts to have more rooms for business expansion. Note that the debts to equity ratio had reduced from 42.8% to 36% in a quarter.*

Debt Coverage - PayPal is well covered by operating cash flow (74.5%)

Interest Coverage - PayPal's interest payments on debts are well covered by EBIT (35.7x coverage)

Cash &amp; Short term investments improves from USD$12.4 billion to USD$13.292

**3. Partnership with Amazon**

PayPal said it had inked a deal with Amazon to allow the firms Venmo wallets in the U.S. to be accepted on Amazons website and mobile app starting next year. Amazon being the largest e-commerce in the world, has **300 million active users** as of (1 November 2021) and **162 million active users** are from US. Due to Amazons global scope and reach, it is also considered one of the most valuable brand worldwide. This also means that PayPal got to access to Amazon users and the payments can be done through PayPal's Venmo wallets. This is going to be the biggest revenue source going forward.

**4. Plenty of room to grow in the ecommerce space**

There is still plenty of runway for growth in electronic payments. Electronic payments only surpassed cash payments on a global basis a couple of years especially during the pandemic period where the baby boomer started to explore the online and as well as developing countries who started to use online and more of the payment services. Over the years, PayPal had built a good reputation on the payment services for being highly secured and as well as bringing conveniences.

**5. Unique business Model - ability to combat fraud**

I believe this area is critical, no one wishes their credit/debit card information to be leaked or to be hacked and misused. **Using PayPal is extremely secured.**

PayPal have this unique business model centers around a two-sided platform, with PayPal enjoying relationships with both merchants and consumers. This approach has material benefits and was instrumental in allowing PayPal to develop its current foothold in the industry. Having information on both sides of the transaction gives PayPal a meaningful edge in combating fraud, which was a very meaningful factor in the early days of the Internet, and remains a key issue.

With an ability to combat fraud, PayPal was in a position to become a valued partner on both sides of a payment. (Source: Morningstar) With this feature, I will always opt to have my items checkout using PayPal if there is an option for it because I know it will be highly secured.

**6. Who owns PayPal, who are the shareholders?**

PayPal are mostly institutional/ fund houses which make up of 82%. This means that many mutual funds or pension funds have invested PayPal for their long term value. 

**Conclusion**

I believe with such a mega cap company, well established company and with lots of potential to grow. No doubt, they might face some competition from square, Apple pay and Alipay but PayPal has already a huge and stable customer based (377 million active users) and they will have the potential to grow even more as popularity on online payments grew.

Let's not let them get away with it.",FallenChickenWing,"\*\*TL;DR\*\* [SFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/sft) looks like a company with awesome potential but is being shorted seemingly for some reason other than profit. I say that because it has &gt;20% short float, and the stock is already basically at an all time low of $6, and the company has a great outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

So while I was looking at [companies with earnings calls this week,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo23iw/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the/) I came across SFT. It's an online used car retailer that buys/sells used cars and delivers them to their customers homes.  While doing some research on it, I realized it looks like a HUGELY undervalued company that's being shorted by some entity for some reason other than to profit off the short position itself. Here are the things that make me think this, some of my reasoning may be dubious but I wanted to share it nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I really can't find ANYTHING negative about them that would explain why their stock is doing as horribly as it is. In fact, some one I know actually called the company and asked how busy they've been lately and the woman on the other end said they've been busier than ever.
2. They had an [AMAZING Q2 earnings call](https://investors.shift.com/static-files/2bcbd914-355b-45a4-a2d7-8e8183a909e7), but only went up 6%. Notice the short positions increased around this time too.
3. Pretty much ANYTIME the stock starts to go up, or during key times like earnings calls, [it gets shorted even more](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SFT/short-interest/).
4. (This one I know is stretching things) When I was doing research on it's competitors, I came across [this site that shows the competition](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-sft/shift-technologies?blueprint=1771080&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=nasdaq#executive-summary%20https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-sft/shift-technologies?blueprint=1771080&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=nasdaq#executive-summary) in small charts with what they offer to the market. Notice how Carvana's chart and Shift's chart look almost identical?
5. It has ""strong buy"" ratings in any analysis I've been able to find on the stock
6. Used cars are more in demand since new car production and shipping is impacted by the supply chain issues and the chip shortage.

&amp;#x200B;

With this stuff in mind, I still can't think of any reason for the stock to be doing as horribly as it has been and for some entity or group of entities to be maintaining what looks like deeply unprofitable short positions. The only thing that comes to mind is that Carvana, SFT's main competitor, is trying to snuff the stock of their competition for some reason. This to me seems deeply gross that a company with a \~$50b market cap is bullying their competitor that has only a \~$500m market cap.

If you guys can think of some reason other than what I mentioned for why the stock is doing as horribly as it is, please let me know. Otherwise, if you guys come to the same conclusion that it's likely Carvana being a fucking bully, let's pile in to the stock and squeeze those fuckers out of their short positions.  Keep in mind, the company actually looks like it has A LOT of growth potential. So if we do go full retard on it and ape in, we could not only be punishing bad behavior by big companies (Carvana) but you'll also get a stock that legit looks like a good investment in the long run.

I probably wont be doing any calls because of the behavior of the entity shorting the stock, but I did do my part and get some shares before earnings today and will likely continue to DCA in because it's does legit look like a great growth potential company.

1,"11/12/2021, 00:34:16",Golden Ocean Group &amp; Marine Shipping - An Inflation Hedge?,Significant_Peach_38,"Hey Everyone,

This is my first post here, andI was hoping to get some thoughts on my play here on investing in shipping transportation company Golden Ocean Group GOGL.

**A little context:**

I've been doing some research on inflation hedges during inflationary periods. The conclusions I have drawn when you exclude the oil shock of the 70s is Energy, Metals &amp; Mining, Chemicals/Industrials, Transportation, and to a lesser extent, traditional Banks seem to do really well during inflationary periods. Many of these companies are  trading at discounts relative to the broader market, so I put about \~30% of my portfolio in these sectors.

**My thoughts:**

I saw that Scion capital had bought GOGL, a Marine Shipping company, so I did some research and found out some interesting facts: they paid a fat dividend (20%), Bulk Shipping rates have exploded, the company's balance sheet is good, boats are new, costs are low, they are less reliant on shipping coal than peers etc. etc. Anyways, I bought it under the macro-economic belief that shipping rates will remain high and this company will be a cash cow during this period. Partially because I think the demand for raw goods will be up, and I think port bottlenecks will remain for some time. If there is a bottleneck at ports, it's like free money for these companies.

**Questions to everyone:**

What are your thoughts on this trade in general?

What are everyone's thoughts on this bet on Marine Transportation in general?

What are your thoughts on Short/long term bulk shipping rates?

What are everyone's thoughts on GOGL?

Thanks for your time, and I look forward to reading your responses.

And this is just the beginning ...

The partnership with Carvana $ CVNA will develop in the 4th quarter, and many cars sold by Carvana will have an advantageous Root insurance package, and Root sales will double ... I am glad that Root will shut the mouths of many who blamed this company, Root being one of the most sorted (48% SI) shares in the last 8 months, making the share decrease by 83% (from $ 27 to $ 4.60 ) .... TOOR$\[::-1\] has been permanently attacked and sabotaged because it is the first tech insurance company to revolutionize the insurance market, and this has bothered many ...

We are also waiting for the partnership with Tesla $ TSLA, which after a long time managed to authorize its own insurance (similar to Root) only in one state (Texas). Elon, instead of wasting years with permits in all states, you can turn to Root because in 2022 they will have coverage throughout the US ...

Also yesterday, Root announced the initiation of a discussion with BlackRock for a financing line, in this way Root will develop more and will preserve the cash he has now (approximately 1 billion). I estimate that Root after Q4 will reach $ 30 per share, and starting with Q1 2022 it is possible to see the first quarterly profit, and Root will explode over $ 50 per share .....

I'm not the smartest tool in the shed, but frankly i'm done living my life as a wageslave.

So I'm willing to risk everything i've got on the YOLO of a lifetime.

Can  you guys give me some pointers how and where (safe platforms with  working cash out functions, and where i can get the highest leverage,...) to  bet.

I'm thinking 'bout buying leveraged longs on BTX, and trying to ride a (hopefully) 10% wave.

Do you think this is feaseable?

Also I dont have any knowledge of this stuff, would it be possible to get leveraged \*100 for a long with a timespan of 1 year +?

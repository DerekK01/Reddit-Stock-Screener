A misconception that I think many investors could have about Truth Social is that it will be dominated by the former president.

I dont expect that to be the case. Since Trump is a smart businessman and a good, experienced showman, he likely knows that almost everyone enjoys variety when it comes to entertainment.

Consequently, I expect many conservative/Republican pundits, debaters and entertainers to share the spotlight with him on Truth Social.

8:01 am ET November 9, 2021 (Benzinga) Print
INOVIO (NASDAQ:INO), a biotechnology company focused on bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to help protect people from infectious diseases and treat cancer and HPV-associated diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided authorization to proceed for INOVIO's INNOVATE Phase 3 Segment for its COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, INO-4800, in the U.S. The FDA has lifted the partial clinical hold following the FDA's review of additional non-clinical, clinical, and device information provided by INOVIO.

Most interesting info from earning call:

Dosing 4800 phase 3 and Dr Kim confirmed that WHO trial may expand to next generation Covid vaccine. If I recall correctly, FDA allows to bridge the next version of vaccine to the phase 3 trial of current vaccine, so WHO can do the same or even more flexible to speed up the the next generation vaccine.

An awesome scenario for INO would be getting EUA for 4802 in Q1 2022. It is possible by starting phase 1/2 of 4802 later this month or early next month.

1. Do phase 1 of 4802 in Columbia and Philippine later this month or next month. INO completed pre-clinical trial and published the result. INO may be waiting funding to next phase, but it may be smarter to fund itself to speed up the process. The cost of doing phase 1 in Columbia or Philippine is not expensive.

2. In the mean time, INO 4800 phase 3 trials continues

3. Early phase 3 4800 and phase 1 4800 readouts in Jan

4. From the early results of both 4800 and 4802, WHO would fund and start an express 4802 phase 3 trial (skip phase 2, and smaller scale phase 3?), and allows to use phase 3 data of 4800 to partially support 4802.

5. From Jan to Mar, expect to receive EUA from China and some countries participated in the trials.

6. In a wonderful scenario, China and some countries may grant EUA for INO 4802 in Feb to Apr. 

INO 4802 would be the first pan covid vaccine to receive EUA. 

Certainly, PFE, MRNA, NVAX has been actively developing pan covid vaccine. mRNA has more advantage in speed, but due to the nature of their vaccines, their scientists may still not be able to resolve increasing side effects with boosters in short time. It may take even more time for NVAX to have pan covid vaccine.

The big advantage of INO is to give booster without concerning increasing side effects as it was confirmed from phase 1,2, booster trials while MRNA, PFE vaccines recorded increasing side effects after second doses from their trials.

Imagine 4802 get EUA and the newer Covid variants beat current vaccine badly.  INO 4802 would be the game changer and take most of entire Covid market. As Dr Kim had mentioned last call, mRNA had good time, but INO DNA time will come. I think INO 4802 will not play as an support role of providing booster, but as central role of main vaccine against new Covid variants. With increasing covid cases in EU, Asia, and lack of vaccine in other parts of the world, new variants will come just a matter of time, and how dangerous they are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqwa1c/repost_from_st_most_interesting_info_from_earning/

If you have some spare funds and waiting to deploy for investment, you may to invest in PayPal   (NASDAQ:PYPL)  as the price has come off significantly. I am waiting for an opportunity to invest into well establish companies at a lower price, PayPal is one of them.  The company had **377 million active accounts at the end of 2020, including 29 million merchant accounts**. The company also owns Xoom, an international money transfer business, and Venmo, a person-to-person payment platform.

**Positive Earning Trend and debts are not an issue**

Their profit margin have been growing from 5.2% in year 2014 to 20.4% in year 2021. They have grown significantly by an average of 25% per year over the past 5 years.

Last profit margin is 20.1% as at 30 September 2021 with a net income of USD4,997 Millions

High ROE - 23.3% (ROE indicates how well a company's management deploys shareholder capital).

Liabilities - debt to equity ratio of 36% (Total debt 7,949 Million / Total Equity 22,090 Million) as at Sep 30, 2021. *As interest rate is low, it is an excellent strategy to take on more debts to have more rooms for business expansion. Note that the debts to equity ratio had reduced from 42.8% to 36% in a quarter.*

Debt Coverage - PayPal is well covered by operating cash flow (74.5%)

Interest Coverage - PayPal's interest payments on debts are well covered by EBIT (35.7x coverage)

Cash &amp; Short term investments improves from USD$12.4 billion to USD$13.292

**Potential - partnership with Amazon** 

 PayPal said it had inked a deal with Amazon to allow the firms Venmo wallets in the U.S. to be accepted on Amazons website and mobile app starting next year. Amazon being the largest e-commerce in the world, has **300 million active users** as of (1 November 2021) and **162 million active users** are from US. Due to Amazons global scope and reach, it is also considered one of the most valuable brand worldwide. This also means that PayPal got to access to Amazon users and the payments can be done through PayPal's Venmo wallets. This is going to be the biggest revenue source going forward. 

**Plenty of room to grow in the ecommerce space**

There is still plenty of runway for growth in electronic payments. Electronic payments only surpassed cash payments on a global basis a couple of years especially during the pandemic period where the baby boomer started to explore the online and as well as developing countries who started to use online and more of the payment services. Over the years, PayPal had built a good reputation on the payment services for being highly secured and as well as bringing conveniences. 

**Unique business Model - ability to combat fraud** 

PayPal have this  unique business model centers around a two-sided platform, with PayPal enjoying relationships with both merchants and consumers. This approach has material benefits and was instrumental in allowing PayPal to develop its current foothold in the industry. Having information on both sides of the transaction gives PayPal a meaningful edge in combating fraud, which was a very meaningful factor in the early days of the Internet, and remains a key issue. With an ability to combat fraud, PayPal was in a position to become a valued partner on both sides of a payment. (Source: Morningstar) With this feature, I will always opt to have my items checkout using PayPal if there is an option for it because I know it will be highly secured. 

**Who are the shareholders of PayPal?** 

Ownership breakdown

* **82% Institutional** 
* 17.9% General Public 
* State or Government 0.04%
* Individual Insider 0.08% 

[Top shareholders of PayPal ](https://preview.redd.it/kgwoblux5sy71.jpg?width=701&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a3c78c9cd04c52b7409ab766d2abfc04376955)

As you can see, the top shareholders of PayPal are mostly institutional/ fund houses which make up of 82%. They do also that believe that PayPal have a value to hold for long term. 

**Fair Value**

With an established client based, strong brand name, good balance sheet and potential. I  will believe that PayPal will have a long way to do. My fair value for PayPal is around 255.

This reeks of 08. And of course people claim that they will be bailed out. Except someones going to hold the bag like JP and Lehman did in 08.

So, we know China and the US arent the friendliest buddies. Or even Europe for that matter. Whats to stop them from pushing it to us? Whos following this and whats your plan or position?

I wanted to add some further DD that comes from a different angle. 

That we apes are not the only ones who see the coming shit storm and are looking to make a tidy profit. 

When *James Cameron's Avatar* came out in 2009 it became the highest grossing film ever making **$2.8 Billion dollars**. It did this largely by being an amazing theatre experience that everyone wanted to see, but it also had the wind at its back in terms of economic conditions. The dollar was weak, exchange rates were favorable, and we were only just limping out of the crash of 08/09. 

Why is this relevant? Because if you look at the chart above, 14 months after that period in '08 when the crash started, Avatar came out. Can you guess what happens in 14 months from now? **Avatar 2 comes out.**

Am I saying James Cameron is best friends with Michael Burry? No. Am I saying that he can predict market crashes? Maybe. Am I saying this is one big strange coincidence that they just so happen to line up exactly as back in '08? Yes. Yes I am. 

**TL;DR** Avatar came out after the last big crash, made bank. Avatar 2 set to come out in a year = next big crash come, makes bank again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqvscg/the_avatar_index_aka_james_cameron_and_the_box/

2. Our burn rate was around $60M, which was as expected.

3. We still have $394 in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments

4. Even more countries are expected to join the P3 INNOVATE trial. This in itself is a mystery, why didn't INO provide clear P3 protocols, more specifically around number of participants. Their P3 trial seems likes its an open book, allowing more countries to come and participate at will. I feel, since the WHO solidarity trial is running parallel with INNOVATE and both have the same design and endpoints, it really doesn't matter who finishes first, the data will likely be the same. Inovio is using their INNOVAITE trial to lock down countries for future EUA, advanced orders and eventually full licensing. They can slow step their part of the P3 focusing on their future market while Solidarity powers through with their few select sites. this way, they get the data at rapid speed and a wide range of potential clients.

5. Stright from the man himself, Kim confirmed P3 dosing for INNOVATE has started.

6.  Africa to soon follow in P3 INNOVATE

7.  LOL, 99% of the P1 participant pool for 4800 opted for the booster dose. If this doesn't tell you something, you need to open your eyes.

8.  VGX-3100 with Quigan biomarker data due by EOY

9.  INO-5401 data due end of THIS WEEK, they seem very excited for the data

10.  Everyone one of the analysts congratulated Kim on his recent successes and FDA hold lift, upgrades to follow?

11.  Oppenhimer analyst Hartaj Singh asked what Inovio's plans are to launch INO-4802 as a booster after INO-4800 has launched. This is a forward thinking statement, showing his strong confidence that INO-4800 will go to market. Sounds like a done deal.

12.  Columbia outreached to Inovio, not the other way around. These countries see the true data and is now approaching INO to be included in P3, this connects back to my #4.

13.  Regarding the IP for the Cellectra 3PSP device, Kim says there is no overlap with the US government as they had previously help fund the development and scale up. He did say ""I don't believe there is"" which is a weak statement. Will need to keep a closer eye on this.

14.  Kim said it's a board range when saying the data is due in the 1st half of 2022 because of the Interim data endpoints. The data could be sooner based on if the endpoints are met sooner.

15.  Kim said INO is the LEADER of the 2nd generation vaccines

16.  Getting India on board in P3 was very significant as they have already reviewed and developed an approval process for another DNA vaccine. It will be quicker to get approval there than anywhere else at the point.

17.  They are still preparing to scale up 3PSP production once advanced orders are made

18.  Kim's closing words were that they feel INO is in a transitional period going to a commercialization in the next several quarters. In my words, 6-9 months we'll be on the market. Anything can happen in the interim, funding, orders, data, etc.

If you enter at the best level, you risk the trade going against you and taking undo heat while waiting for the trade to prove itself. In Trading the only probability that is 100% is that you will lose money at some point. This is why we weight risk vs reward and look at how much we are willing to risk for being wrong. Every entry should have a define risk exit and profit target.

The interesting part of the release is that their lock-up period expires earlier than expected 12 November (which is just in two days) instead of the 6th of December

I think the current valuation of MNDY is high just because only 7% of its outstanding shares are traded so there aren't many shares to trade and most of the holders are institutions.

Those institions kept the share price high to make easy money on PUT selling in the last couple of months.

But now it is going to change as many insider holders (like employees and management) will be able to cash some of their holdings.

I expect the shares price to drop considerably in the upcoming days.

I think they have over valued their IPO and they could see the shares drop by as much as 20%. Full disclosure, I've reserved a R1T for next year and hope to drive one soon, but this IPO seems like the perfectly wrong time as we red across the board pre-market.

*****

# [Stock futures are lower ahead of key inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. equity futures nudged lower early Wednesday as investors await key data that will indicate how much rising price pressures are accelerating.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed about 60 points. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Investors are holding their breath for the latest consumer price index reading, which the Labor Department will report Wednesday before the bell. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.6% increase, or a year-over-year gain of 5.9%, which would be the most in 30 years. They expect core CPI, which excludes food and energy, to have risen 0.4%, or 4.3% year-over-year.
*****
&gt; With Thursday a government holiday due to the Veterans Day observance, the department also will release its weekly jobless claims count a day earlier than usual. The Dow Jones estimate is for 265,000 first-time filings for unemployment insurance, which would mark a fresh pandemic-era low.
*****
&gt; In regular trading Tuesday, the Dow lost about 0.3% to close at 36,319.98. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4%, snapping an eight-day win streak, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The sell-off in Tesla continued as the electric vehicle stock fell more than 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after ending nearly 12% lower and more than 16% down on the week.
*****
&gt; The weakness in Tesla (which is largely technical, not fundamental) is also weighing on the consumer discretionary sector within the S&amp;P 500 today, and the October PPI may also be doing so as business input prices continue to rise, Goldman Sachs Jeff Currie said in a note Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The prospect of Covid transforming from pandemic to endemic, and the potential for supply chain congestion to moderate are all likely to continue to drive growth, albeit more slowly, Currie added.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday morning, the Labor Department reported a 0.6% increase in the October producer price index, which iwas in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate. Wholesale prices jumped 8.6% in October from a year ago, however, the hottest annual pace on record in almost 11 years.
*****
&gt; Investor worries came to the fore again today, Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, told CNBC. The inflation narrative is still out there and needs to be resolved. We think investors will see inflation abate in the coming months as the Fed remains accommodative, people come back into the workforce and consumers shift from buying goods to services and we expect that will pull the market higher as we move toward the end of the year.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues to be strong, with most of the S&amp;P 500 companies who have already reported earnings beating estimates, according to FactSet. Disney, Affirm, Bumble and The Honest Company are all scheduled to report Wednesday after the bell.

Is this actually true though?

A few quick metrics...

Revenue has grown 10% over 2019FY
Net Income has grown 25% over 2019FY
Free Cash Flow has grown 30% over 2019FY

Even in 2020, FCF grew over 2019 - During Covid!

Price to Book @ 1.38

12 month FCF stands at $29 billion.  With the current risk free rate, this equates to about $1 trillion market value.  Add in cash and deduct long term debt, we are sitting at $1.1 trillion.

Why is this valued only at $650 billion when so many other equities are over or at value using FCF valuation? It also underperforms within it's industry.

# Earnings play 

As many of you, I like to play the earnings season. For some stocks it's quite easy to predict whether they continue to rise or fall, since they show similar patterns

That point brings me back to $CLOV. In the past quarters the stock tanked after the reporting. After a few days the stock then started a minor uptrend (\~20%). I will use the opportunity to open a trade with a SL just below the strong resitance level (\~ 6.7$). Profit taken could be done above 9$. That adds up to a risk/reward of \~2.

Entry: 7.5$

SL: 6.7$

SL: &gt;9$ or  (depends whether you are a $CLOV-tard or not :P)

In the previous analysis, we realized that the majority of gains were made from the listing itself and those who invested on listing day gained a measly 1.3%.

In most cases, [less than 10% of the total IPO](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price) is allocated to retail investors. Adding to this, a multitude of other factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not in the end \[2\].

Given that the chances of you making it into the IPO allotment are bleak, what I wanted to analyze is, if we miss the IPO bus,

**What is the best time to buy into a recently IPOd stock?**

Should it be on the listing day itself or should you wait a day, week, or even a month for all the hype surrounding the IPO to die down and the stock to come back to its real valuation \[3\]?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n5wmym9n7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3106183b0670cb5c790d5034bf7ee76a4ca194b)

**Data**

I have leveraged the same data source (iposcoop.com) that I used last time. They have documented almost all the IPOs from 2000. But for this analysis, I also needed stock price-related information for periods long after the stock had been listed in the market.

The stock price information was obtained using Yahoo Finance. After all the quality checks, we are left with 1,063 IPOs from 2000-2020. All the data used in the analysis has been shared through a Google sheet at the end.

 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9skwwgan7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9789e067c476b12b7b962d587c002320623c388b)

**Analysis**

Since the idea is to find the best time to invest in an IPO, we have to compare the returns for multiple time periods. I calculated the one month and one year returns in case you had invested on the day of the IPO as well as if you had invested in the stock after

1. One day
2. One week
3. One month

The returns are then compared against each other to find the optimal time to invest in the stock after it has IPOd. The returns were finally benchmarked against SPY to see if it makes sense to put in all these efforts - only to maybe underperform the market!

https://preview.redd.it/w2qnh2an7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e659778bbe8aaf8893f5d6f2ea21288ef4b7a71

 **Results** 

[ All calculations are done using the adjusted closing price  ](https://preview.redd.it/vknekrzo7ry71.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fe4c5b99687e881d342df706a16fcd0ac0f255f)

Surprisingly, the gains you would have made from the IPOs are inversely proportional to the amount of time you waited for your investment. On average **the most amount of return is obtained by someone who invested on the day of the IPO itself**. The more amount of time you wait for your investment, the lesser your return is!

But what if you are not interested in the short-term returns? What if you are a buy-and-hold type of investor?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uazvvt0q7ry71.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ff88f577596544308b493f072d66240507cc7d)

If you are a long-term investor, **you would be better off buying the IPO after waiting for a week**, as it generated the most amount of return. But what is interesting is that waiting a week for the hype to die down would only increase your return by 9%. Waiting any further would only ***decrease your overall return.***

So if you are planning on buying into an IPO but did not get an allocation at the listing price, you can wait a week so as to see how it performs in the market, avoid any large swings that the first week might cause, and still come out on top over the long run!

Now, lets compare the performance of IPO stocks against SPY. After all, even though you are getting a good return on your investment, if it does not beat the market, you would have been better off just investing it in SPY rather than doing all this research on IPOs.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ehviuevq7ry71.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=880c9f18392da5832a239819b38cd6dc04893875)

IPOs returns on average ***beat the market*** over the last two decades. The trends are similar to the ones observed earlier with the delta over the market return depending on how much time you waited before investing into the IPO and generating the highest amount of delta by waiting one week from the day of the IPO.

Now it would be amiss not to discuss the inherent risks associated with investing in an IPO. Out of the 1,063 IPOs in our analysis, only 62% of them gained in value and only a measly 29% of the IPOs beat the market over the long run. The outperformance over the market is coming due to a few outliers (Tesla - 25,000%+, Shopify - 5800%+, etc.) If you miss out on the top 1% of successful IPOs, your returns would be much lesser than the market. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5np1iman7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed89afca9e90fdc3288899fcab548a8155beecdc)

**Limitations**

The above analysis comes with some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy

1. The number of IPOs in the analysis is approximately 1/3rd of the total IPOs which occurred during 2000-2020 \[4\]. I dont think this is a major concern since our sample of 1000+ stocks would be much more than enough to give statistical significance to our analysis.
2. Another limitation is that the delta that you are observing here might just be due to the additional risk that you are taking by buying into lesser-known/small-cap companies. The risk-adjusted return might give a different result.
3. Continuing from the above point, we are currently in a massive bull run with ATH being broken every week. So the additional risk you are taking will be well rewarded but the outcome might look different if we do the same analysis in the middle of a bear market.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qk5hm49s7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77fe292757c841d6ecd666b499a9315e48595f25)

**Conclusion**

Buying into an IPO is an exciting prospect. Our analysis proves that even if you miss out on getting the IPO allocation, its still possible to beat the market by investing after the stock is listed on the market.

As I [explained in my last post on IP](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/)O, investment banks are incentivized to slightly underprice while listing (unless its a really popular company) so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO) \[5\].

Whatever the case may be, if you are planning on holding on to the IPO only for a short period of time, you can maximize your returns by investing in the IPO as soon as its listed whereas if you are a long term investor who is planning to hold on to the stock for a very long time, its better to wait a week or so for the stock price to settle before making your move!

Truly wild times we are living in!

\[2\] Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients - [In the case of TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.

\[3\] Take the examples of Robinhood and Coinbase IPO. Robinhood tanked on listing day losing 8% only to rally almost 100% in the next one week before coming back down to near its IPO pricing. Coinbase also had a wild ride on listing day with the share price going as high as $429 before crashing back down to \~$310.

\[4\] The major limitation was the absence of financial data in Yahoo Finance for certain stocks.

\[5\] There are a lot of contradictory opinions regarding this with [some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275531918309280) showcasing that IPOs are usually undervalued while [others argue](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/17/3/811/1612977?redirectedFrom=PDF) that IPOs are overvalued. I guess you can twist data however you want to tell your story.

This is *not* financial advice.  This *is* autistic advice.  


* Cortexyme Inc., (CRTX) does Alzheimers drug research.
* One of their most promising drugs, Atuzaginstat, recently completed a phase 2/3 GAIN trial on October 26th, 2011.
* The trial did not meet all end points, resulting in a large price movement (-76%) on this news.
* Despite not meeting all end points, Atuzaginstat was shown to work incredibly well in a pre-specified subgroup of participants with P. gingivalis DNA detectable in saliva which resulted in a 57% slowing of cognitive decline as measured by ADAS-Cog11 in the 80 mg BID arm (p=0.02) and a 42% slowing in the 40 mg BID arm (p=0.07) vs. placebo.
* Current medical research has been uncovering links between Porphyromonas gingivalis and various health problems, including non-fatty liver disease.  You should use mouthwash.
* The company is currently meeting with various regulators worldwide to get the drug approved for the subgroup based on the data from the study.
* Previous Alzheimers drugs have been approved despite failing trails, most recently Biogen and Eli Lilly.  Biogen got its drug Aduhelm approved by the FDA earlier this year. Eli Lilly was recently granted an accelerated review by the agency for its early Alzheimer's disease candidate Donanemab.  Even the Motley Fool recently speculated Cortexyme could see an approval for Atuzaginstat based on the lack of viable drugs to treat this devastating disease.
* CRTX is fairly low float with only 20M shares.
* This stock is currently heavily oversold, gap is yet to fill.
* The stock is on the top of many heavily shorted stock lists, estimated SI is 51.17% as of 11/9/21.
* The stock has risen from a low of $12.41 after the trial news to around $16.50 currently.
* A PT of $25-$30 is very reasonable while the company waits for regulator review and approval for the subgroup identified to benefit from the drug, although a squeeze could be much higher.
* If approved for this population, CRTX may see $100+ again short term.
* Cortexyme is set to present full study details at a major conference (CTAD) tomorrow, Thursday **11**/**11** at **11**AM.
* In a casino, getting three in a row is considered a very good thing.
* For these reasons and many others, in addition to the recent consolidation pattern present on the stock's chart, I strongly believe CRTX has nowhere to go but up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqrys8/crtx_to_the_moon_a_bullish_case_dd/

1,"11/10/2021, 17:29:23","AMC is primed for a June style run-up or even greater within the next week (Wyckoff Accumulations, Long-Straddles, Cycle Theory, Technicals)",airplane3579,"You might be asking, why the hell am I saying that AMC is on the verge of another run-up? This will be a little long, but bear with me. Let's start off with a meme of how Mid-Late November will play out.

https://preview.redd.it/b1uykhrikqy71.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db41a2700a3205ae2358f012ca76d799b0ad559d

Okay let's start. The reason why I am saying AMC is on the verge of a run-up is because bullish institutions are buying up and accumulating AMC shares in advance before letting it run in a massive bull and FOMO run. Let's start with the Wyckoff Accumulations and a Technical Analysis.

[Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic](https://preview.redd.it/y4ttcjvnkqy71.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7ddb9ea6c9a9ef11c83464dc6c4fefe7ebefa9)

[AMC July Accumulation](https://preview.redd.it/aotue7qtkqy71.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8c58af1103a4b7540ff4d0e27d45b6933a6a075)

[AMC Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/wbagmoawkqy71.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6082e03ad53f8c2ebb195bbab7a51d746b14392)

Looking at the diagrams above (I will NOT overlay the distribution phases to avoid accidently creating FUD), you'll notice that AMC is once again in a Wyckoff Accumulation Phase that is breaking out of its bull-pennant. Bullish institutions are accumulating AMC shares in advance before letting AMC do another June or greater rally in the very near future, and we're past the middle of Phase D. We should expect 5-7 days of BU/LPS consolidation before the massive bull and FOMO rally just before Late-November. How are institutions and Wall Street floor traders hedging this? Through Long Straddle Options of course! Let's look at the Long-Straddle diagram and Long-Straddles detected in the last couple weeks.

You'll also notice I overlaid the March-July candlestick pattern, this is because they look substantially similar to the pattern we saw before the June run-up and utilizing Cycle Theory, AMC is expected to have another run-up very soon.

[Long-Straddle Schematic](https://preview.redd.it/txm67ybalqy71.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c5409cefc6daffd5eabd0b4ed13e5708669c8a3)

[AMC Long-Straddle | Unusual Options Activity](https://preview.redd.it/m9kxxjadlqy71.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aaa54b02b3b20975e147e61b404ef7c3ebb7d19)

Looking at the Unusual Options Activity for October 27; which is a snapshot, non-updating unusual activity log, you'll notice 2 sets of Long-Straddles were bought at the same exact time with the same volume, strike price, and the same expiry. This can only be done by a Wall Street floor trader or a trader who uses a professionalized interfaced trading platform. Long-Straddles are used to hedge; in this case puts; using calls, against the next coming massive rally very soon, with the same exact strikes, volumes, and expiry's. Looking at the turnover and the diagram, you'll notice the Long-Puts are substantially more expensive than the Long-Calls as they are ITM with massive Intrinsic Value. The Long-Calls are being used to hedge against the Intrinsic Value devaluation of the Long-Puts for when the massive \[FOMO\] bull-rally takes place.

Let's go back to the chart and look a little bit closer.

[February Accumulation 2h Chart](https://preview.redd.it/tfq2lcnmlqy71.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=414c2931b54918c71765e15a05f922e0f300eb10)

Looking closer at the chart, we have practically an identical pullback like we saw in the Middle of May during Phase D. Despite the dip from the excellent earnings we had that caused some frustration, we can actually see that the pullback was a good thing in the views of price-action as we're now consolidating in the BU/LPS stage of Phase D, AMC is entering the final stage of consolidation before the next huge run-up we're expecting to have.

***Financials of the company and why is WISH undervalued &amp; trading lower than many companies***

The Financials of WISH are not as bad as you may think. Let's look at Financials of WISH

&amp;#x200B;

Their revenues have been going up YoY, however the reason why this stock got absolutely destroyed in 2021 is because their Net Income was largely affected by Advertisement spending. They did talk about reducing Ad spending in their previous quarter, which would reflect in tomorrow's quarter and upcoming quarters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's look at $NKLA. I AM FULLY AWARE that NKLA isn't a competitor of WISH, but I just want to show you guys how market is underpricing WISH by almost 200%. There are many 0 revenues and non profitable companies out there with 0 products trading at double digits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look at NKLA's Revenues and Net Income. YET, this company is trading at $14. I am not a finance PRO but anyone with an IQ over 70 can tell that WISH financials are in better position than NKLA and many similar companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you must be thinking that it's unfair to compare NKLA with WISH. Well okay, let's compare an ecommerce company with $WISH.

Look at JMIA's financials below. The company has never touched 200M$ in revenue and has been reporting negative NET Income just like $WISH &amp; Yet it's trading double digits.

***The company is really active and has made a lot of changes since Q2 Fall.*** 

Events that took place since Q2 - 

* They announced that they would improve their product quality and has been constantly adding branded products on their websites.
* They hired a new CFO who has a solid track record.
* Wish partnered with Klarna.
* Wish partnered with Spanish Carrier, Correos.
* Wish has drastically improved their shipping time.
* Wish now offers same day pickup at many locations.
* WISH has been trying to get into Fintech sector. They came up with WISH Cash

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Will this company be 100$ after tomorrow's earnings? Absolutely NOT. However, it could go up as much as 100% depending on EPS and Revenue Beat.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Why will the company beat earnings tomorrow?***

Let's look at the previous Expected Revenues &amp; Actual Revenues. The expected revenue for Q3 2021 is 373M (ALMOST HALF AS PREVIOUS QUARTER).

If WISH is able to report 500M+ revenues which would be almost 50-60% surprise then this stock could     tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

***What to do if stock goes after earnings?***

The IV on this stock is pretty good. Let's say you own 1000+ shares and stock goes down tomorrow then you can simply sell Covered Calls to lower down your average and have that constant cashflow. 

Think of it as an investment into a fixed asset such as buying a property and think of premium from selling weekly covered calls as a rent.

1,"11/10/2021, 17:12:58","AMC is primed for a June style run-up or even greater within the next week (Wyckoff Accumulations, Long-Straddles, Cycle Theory, Technicals)",airplane3579,"You might be asking, why the hell am I saying that AMC is on the verge of another run-up? This will be a little long, but bear with me. Let's start off with a meme of how Mid-Late November will play out.

https://preview.redd.it/rryeej77gqy71.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be8e81e537699938cf0d607e67979142ca5f2c2

Okay let's start. The reason why I am saying AMC is on the verge of a run-up is because bullish institutions are buying up and accumulating AMC shares in advance before letting it run in a massive bull and FOMO run. Let's start with the Wyckoff Accumulations and a Technical Analysis.

[Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic](https://preview.redd.it/vbbr8c7jgqy71.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41385f432df89e47d789dc09ab121f6664371fc1)

[AMC February Accumulation](https://preview.redd.it/wclfj0aogqy71.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f9510a619c9a77f1829c74ace5e4b015528be00)

[AMC July Accumulation](https://preview.redd.it/66v7p34sgqy71.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f891993a5bc517ee27d600ba21a644a120879b03)

[AMC Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/ca0loxpygqy71.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2a51f93309d02ce9d57f510e94ba744d51a69ea)

Looking at the diagrams above (I will NOT overlay the distribution phases to avoid accidently creating FUD), you'll notice that AMC is once again in a Wyckoff Accumulation Phase that is breaking out of its bull-pennant. Bullish institutions are accumulating AMC shares in advance before letting AMC do another June or greater rally in the very near future, and we're past the middle of Phase D. We have already hit the SOS point of Phase D on Monday and we should expect 5-7 days of BU/LPS consolidation before the massive bull and FOMO rally just before Late-November. How are institutions and Wall Street floor traders hedging this? Through Long Straddle Options of course! Let's look at the Long-Straddle diagram and Long-Straddles detected in the last couple weeks.

You'll also notice I overlaid the March-July candlestick pattern, this is because they look substantially similar to the pattern we saw before the June run-up and utilizing Cycle Theory, AMC is expected to have another run-up very soon.

[Long-Straddle Schematic](https://preview.redd.it/4udn3agthqy71.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87b3c76883507b2054e192172f9b5eb13027b3be)

[AMC Long-Straddle | Unusual Options Activity](https://preview.redd.it/zyelfjr1iqy71.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ca58ae808331c88343433aca2a73c6cfe2b44a7)

Looking at the Unusual Options Activity for October 27; which is a snapshot, non-updating unusual activity log, you'll notice 2 sets of Long-Straddles were bought at the same exact time with the same volume, strike price, and the same expiry. This can only be done by a Wall Street floor trader or a trader who uses a professionalized interfaced trading platform. Long-Straddles are used to hedge; in this case puts; using calls, against the next coming massive rally very soon, with the same exact strikes, volumes, and expiry's. Looking at the turnover and the diagram, you'll notice the Long-Puts are substantially more expensive than the Long-Calls as they are ITM with massive Intrinsic Value. The Long-Calls are being used to hedge against the Intrinsic Value devaluation of the Long-Puts for when the massive \[FOMO\] bull-rally takes place.

Let's go back to the chart and look a bit closer.

[February Accumulation 2h Chart](https://preview.redd.it/vfoxf2b9iqy71.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9c3b1e6145609aa375f506fd0719bb495630adc)

Looking closer at the chart, we have practically an identical pullback like we saw in the Middle of May during Phase D. Despite the dip from the excellent earnings we had that caused some frustration, we can actually see that the pullback was a good thing in the views of price-action as we're now consolidating in the BU/LPS stage of Phase D after the SOS stage, AMC is entering the final stage of consolidation before the next huge run-up we're expecting to have.

1,"11/10/2021, 16:03:30",Nakd should be valued at an EV company but bears are still shorting it!,marcusbabang,"Apes, I am making a case for $nakd to today, cause right at this moment. The bears are mauling at it to its death. So here is a short scenario, There is a nerdy savant kid ($nakd) in school who was playing basketball with his school friends (retail investors). Suddenly they realize this savant is killing at 3 pointers. Started creating side bets with other students and they are making gains and if this carries on he might be playing for the school team soon. 

But this does not sit well with one of the school team players (bears/shorts), who usually are the assholes of the school. The coach(media) does not care as there is a huge game coming up (Rivian ipo, Telsa and market overall tanked) . So with very few people knowing about it, the asshole (bear/short) went on a rampage and smashes everyone's faces to the ground. Immediately, so ran as fast as they could  (paper hands). While a few (diamond hands) stood up together and face the fight.

Right now, the few (diamond hands) are struggling and know that the savant is undervalued and needs to shine. 

I am not kidding you that yesterday was brutal... It went up 40% on the merger news that it will be a EV play. But it loses everything to only a single percentage positive increase. Which is way below $1 dollar per share at the current moment. 

Aside from this here are the reasons why it is a good time to invest $nakd.   
\- No EV company that I know of is valued below $1 dollar.    
It is FREE MONEY! guys!  
\- Let's take a look at Rivian($70++) Byd ($39), and Arrival ($12.88) as the close rival for the commercial vehicle sector. But Rivian and Arrival have not delivered the actual vehicle to date. Rivian has 100,000 pre-orders deliveries by 2025.  
Now, Let take a look at Cenntro.  
Existing sales - 4,400 vehicle sales  
2021- 1,500 vehicle sales  
2022- 21,500 vehicle sales  
2023 - 74,800 vehicle sales.  
Total = 102,200

That is the same numbers but faster by 2 years. WTF!!! Why it is valued at like air and I ain't not talking about Air Jordan.

Great Q and some big partnership announcements. Hydrogen is indisputably going to be part of our energy mix and PLUG will he a key beneficiary. 

PLUGs business mix is evolving as hydrogen gains traction. They are now going beyond just mobility solutions (eg installing fuel cells in forklifts for WMT and AMZN). Now they want to go after big projects and focusing on manufacturing of electrolyzers and hydrogen fuelling systems. The opportunity is big.

What does not make sense is that PLUG now trades at $23b market cap while Nel SA, arguably the leader in electrolyzers and hydrogen fuelling solutions, is trading at only $3bn market cap. 

There are differences between the companies in terms of revenue mix and their recent project momentum as well. PLUG announced some
Big deals. But it seems that can not alone explain the difference. 

One of the issues is that Nel SA is not listed here in the US so it does not have the same presence in investors minds.

NLLSF is the ADR. If you are looking for a value alternative to PLUG this one is worth checking out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqocpg/plug_vs_nel_sa_big_valuation_difference_makes_nel/

Once I woke up in the morning , to my surprise, in my tfsa account, 15 calls was purchased for about 7500 USD even this is a Tfsa account, it is not a margin account and should be  cash secured.

To my surprise, CAT WENT down in the morning and I had to cut my loses, after selling 15 calls at discount of 50%, I lost all my 3000usd and I owe CIBC 400 USD and I was told to pay back the money I owe in my Tfsa account.

Interactive broker would reject the order or partially fill the order in tfsa.  CIbc tfsa account seems let you borrow the money to purchase 7500 USD securities when you only have 3000 Usd.  Is this a bug for CIBC investor edge?  Is just possible to ask CIBC to cover my loss since they didn't reject the order or partially fill the order as since there was not enough balance and they still let me borrow 2x money of my balance?

1. Fubo is a growth sports streamer company, reporting fantastic numbers every quarter, 3 digits growth YOY. And recently hit 1M subscribers. Every subscription equals 75$ a month in revenues. 
2. Recently the company integrated sports betting in the platform. First ever streamer in the world to do so. This is a huge advantage other competitors, and a wild card to Massive profitability in the future. 
3. The company made a massive acquisition recently. Fubo announced its acquiring Molotov TV. A Sports streaming company that operates in Europe and has 10M+ subscribers. In my opinion this international acquisition is massive for Fubo and will affect the next quarter big time. This is a step in the right direction for a company like fubo that only operates in the US. 
4. Short interest is very high - 25% of the float is sold short, many short reports suggested to sell the stock a year ago after a massive run, suggesting the company will never meet its goals. 

CONCLUSION: 
Fubo TV is currently outperforming analysts and their own goals, surprisingly, against all odds, this company is other delivering in a very competitive industry. I believe a short squeeze is very likely to happen until year end. Lets show these hedge funds that we are back! Help me to make more awareness of this unique situation.

1,"11/10/2021, 12:21:06",The Bull Case for $COIN - All your base are belong to us,ImplementNo1705,"After-hours trading for COIN is down \~13%. But why?

Largely, it is due to missing ""analyst estimates"", as well as lower numbers (earnings, volume, EBITDA, revenue, and profit, basically everything) than Q2. 

However, this was to be expected. First, Coinbase even alluded to it in their Q2 earnings. Second, there are public trackers that track asset volume (see Nomics).  How in the world did these so-called ""analyst"" get it so wrong, when everything was available to get it right?

Answer: These ""analysts"" are retarded

Here's the down and dirty:

I'll start with the cons, since there are so few:

It's a shitty app. Their customer support is non-existent. It's like Robin-da-hood's support, it's not there. But which other asset app like theirs ISN'T dog shit? 

Now for the pros:

1. As they mentioned in their earnings, they've added a bunch of other assets people can trade. This will only add to potential volume. 
2. They are currently the market leader in volume, total revenue, total assets on their exchange, and profits. 
3. They have not only added assets, but also added NFTs. Another thing to check off the list. Their asset sheet is only growing.
4. They've added innovative features, such as Coinbase Prime (no fucking clue really what that is), Coinbase Cloud (who doesn't fucking love the cloud?), and will soon have payroll and expense reimbursements so people can YOLO their paychecks into assets faster and easier. 
5. THEY ARE ADDING 24/7 LIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT (lmao)

Things can only go up from here (please help me hold these bags)

Saw the incredible growth, and solid profitability, and knew that I found a great company. They reported earnings today after hours, and I was honestly shocked to see the price down because I assumed they would have done poorly. So grudgingly, I go to check the actual results and I was blown away. Here were the results:

&amp;#x200B;

**Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 Highlights**

* The Company facilitated 49,332 certified loans during the third quarter of 2021, compared to 20,696 certified loans in the third quarter of 2020
* **Total revenue was $58.9 million during the third quarter of 2021**, compared to $29.8 million in the third quarter of 2020
* **Gross profit was $52.5 million during the third quarter of 2021**, compared to $27.3 million in the third quarter of 2020
* **Net income was $29.4 million during the third quarter of 2021**, compared to net loss of $(71.1) million in the third quarter of 2020
* Adjusted EBITDA was $42.1 million during the third quarter of 2021, compared to $19.8 million in the third quarter of 2020

So I go check out a couple of articles because many of them read that the EPS was a miss, which could have been the case but this is ridiculous. These news companies have literally written the EPS completely wrong. They said that $LPRO reported -0.23 in earnings (which is a loss) even though their net income was 29M for the quarter. I scratched my penis for an hour wondering how a company with positive net income could have a negative EPS and came to the conclusion that these idiots are completely wrong. 

Here are the two articles:  
""Open Lending (LPRO) came out with a **quarterly loss of $0.23 per share** versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.20. This compares to earnings of $0.10 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.""-[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/open-lending-lpro-reports-q3-loss-tops-revenue-estimates](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/open-lending-lpro-reports-q3-loss-tops-revenue-estimates) and [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/open-lending-lpro-reports-q3-001512794.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/open-lending-lpro-reports-q3-001512794.html)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: THE MARKET IS TOTALLY MESSING UP THIS GEM OF A COMPANY, WITH INSANE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to bring out the conspiracy hat and say a bunch of random stuff, but it just seems irresponsible and frankly weird for these results to be wrongly reported.

1,"11/10/2021, 10:55:09","My Magnum Opus: The only investment you can bolster by jerkin it - CryoPort, Inc. (CYRX)",TheFleshGordon,"Random internet strangers, I write to you today bearing gifts.  While most of you have been trying to make plays on electric vehicles or the latest meme, I have been in the background searching for the greatest investment ever.  What I have found is [CryoPort, Inc.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRX?p=CYRX)

First a little background, CryoPort is listed as **CYRX**.  According to the company, Cryoport, Inc., is a ""life sciences"" company. They provide temperature-controlled logistics solutions. They serve three main industries, Biopharmaceutical, Animal Health and IVF services under ""CryoStork"".

While you might be assuming I want to tell you about is the Biopharmaceutical services, as Animal Health is more of a niche and IVF can't be that big, you my simple reader are wrong. The reason CryoPort is going to take off is due to IVF and CryoStork. Lets take a look together at the only two points we care about:

1. What is CryoStork
2. Why is it going to hulk dick?

At this point you may be questioning, ""Flesh, what the hell is CryoPort? And why have I even read this far?""

Answer: You probably should have stopped reading this far, but now that I know that its just the boys, The real answer is **Semen**.  Yup you read correctly, sperm, jizz, spooge, baby batter, man chowder, cum, trouser gravy. Hopefully I have peaked your interest and you read on to point 1,

**What is CryoStork?**

According to their [website](https://mycryostork.com) ""Cryoport is proud to provide you and your family our exclusive CryoStork IVF shipping services to ensure your ***precious reproductive materials*** are handled with care from clinic to clinic, safely and securely."" While they don't come right out and say it, ""Precious reproductive materials"" only means two things eggs, and boneless children.  CryoPort utilizes ""cold chain logistics solutions for temperature-sensitive life sciences materials"" and has three advantages over the competition:

1. Cryoport Express Shippers - Proprietary modifications to shippers that are""*scientifically engineered to ensure your precious materials are transported safely and securely. Our lightweight shippers feature a combination of advanced packaging, cryogenics and high-vacuum technology,allowing for a hold time of up to 10 days.*""
2. Cryoportal which is their logistics management platform which they use to monitor #3
3. Smartpak II a leading-edge condition monitoring system that ""*provides our team visibility on the conditions of your valuable IVF materials throughout the entire shipping process by monitoring location, pressure, orientation, temperature, tampering, shock and humidity.*""

Basically this is high class limousine service for your spunk.  Which leads us to point 2,

**Why is it going to hulk dick?**

According to a research report by some Lord of the Rings firm that I was unwilling to purchase, ""The sperm bank market is expected to record a **CAGR of 3.3%** between 2021 and 2026."" Another book report on semen storage projects a **CAGR of 5.2%**. Now this might not seem like anything crazy but the sperm bank market was 4.7 billion in 2019.  So we are talking about a decent increase in the near future.

While CryoPort is not a sperm bank, someone needs to move the mountains of man milk from place to place. So any increase in infertility, IVF, or donations will increase the shipping needs. This raises the questions, is infertility rising? Are IVF treatments increasing? Are more dudes donating their homemade protein?

Don't you worry baby birds, I'll feed you.

**Infertility:**

According to the CDC: ""The provisional **number of births** for the United States in 2019 was 3,745,540, down 1% from the number in 2018 (3,791,712). This is the fifth year that the number of births has declined after the increase in 2014, down an average of 1% per year, and the lowest number of births since 1985.""

Infertility is a growing issue for many females. Infertility affects**6.1 million American females** (approximately 10% of American females of childbearing age).

* The current increase in infertility might be the result of more womenchoosing to delay starting a family until later in life when theirreproductive health can be affected.
* Or it could be due to STDs like the Clap which can result in conditionssuch as blocked tubes, preventing pregnancy from occurring.

**Infertility Services:**

https://preview.redd.it/ip54rm6gnoy71.png?width=2056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c60cf441f120033d06236ca057fc985d24a9dfee

We know Infertility Services are increasing and Infertility issues are also on the rise.  Throw in COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain issues and the Sperm shipping industry was hardened and back up, some might even say blue-balled.  With the supply chain issues starting to decrease and more nations coming out of lockdown, the need for seed has never been greater.  You can invest in CryoPort and then go donate at your local sperm bank to replenish the supply.

Considering how unpredictable Tesla traders are, I'm thinking it would be worth it to take the risk. If Tesla happens to jump back at even 1270$ (20$ higher than strike), gains would be litterally more than X10 the initial option price. With my pitiful net worth of 20k$ (I'm 19), I was thinking of maybe buying 100$ worth of calls. I would be ready to lose that kind of money for the chance of making 1k or far more if Tesla happens to jump back by Friday.

1,"11/10/2021, 10:41:02","Nov 4th, Schwab Market Data Massive Lag. I should really switch to Fidelity.",NeedCookies8,"So I've been a Charles Schwab user since August of last year, 2020. I've been really thinking about moving to Fidelity for the last few months. I don't know why I don't just move my accounts to Fidelity. Schwab has a good platform (could be better), is a bank, the color blue lol but not a reason, Schwab gives me leniency with trading for the $25k rule and more, and good customer service but so does Fidelity I've heard. Schwab just feels easy and comfortable because I've basically been using them since I've been investing. Throughout this year I've been considering moving to Fidelity because there have been some small things that have happened with StreetSmart Edge and just trading with Schwab in general. I do day trade and also do long-term investing. There have been times where it has taken 10 seconds to a few minutes for my cost basis/ cost per share to pop up on the screen and I have lost out on money and lost money because of this before. I'd put up with it about 6-8 months ago when that happened and hasn't happened since. It happened a few times. I haven't run into that problems since then, mainly because I haven't been placing trades as often as I used to. Something happened last week though with Schwab's desktop trading app and updating market data.

Last week though... this is really what has gotten to me and honestly, when this happened I was really pissed and shocked at what was going. I sort of had no idea what to think. I called customer service after this happened, and they took down what I had to say and looked into it with the tech division or whatever division that handles market matching data. They didn't call me back after I asked them to, it was fixed a few minutes later and didn't happen again. I took a couple of screenshots of my trading screen of SSE alongside by side with Fidelity's Active Trader Pro Trading app. I saved another screenshot along with this one, but deleted the other picture (thankfully I saved at least one screenshot I took) because at the time I was going to post here on Reddit about it, but decided not to at the time because 1) I didn't have time, 2) I thought it would be taken care of (which it was), 3) it was fixed so thought it wasn't an issue anymore and it remains not an issue, and 4) because I was lazy that day/ last week and deferred writing this post until tonight. Since the 4th of November last week I have forgotten about it a little, but has been in the back of my mind since, so I am writing this now. Maybe this was just a small issue/ glitch in the system at the moment and isn't how Schwab runs things on their servers. Possibly this is a stupid post, but I don't think so.

So onto it.. Last week on November 4th, I had Fidelity's Active Trader Pro and Schwab's SSE programs up to look at the market data because I've noticed all the time that Schwab doesn't print the time and sales for all transactions while Fidelity does. Schwab updates the current bids and asks that are at the top of the ask/ bid table along with the other bids and asks (that match with Fidelity, other than Schwab that does lump together orders for the same price mostly), but then doesn't print all of the sales in premarket and I'm sure for the market times as well. I have direct trading and level 2 data. Sometimes during market hours, I notice this. Maybe I don't have all of the exchanges listed for the printing of sales or something. There will be transactions that Schwab doesn't print that Fidelity prints. So, when I want to sell something I am thinking of the wrong price to sell it at because I am seeing a sell at a certain price and thinking, oh I'll set my limit to this price, even though Schwab is listing the current bid and ask, but the time and sales aren't being listed. So I set my limit to a price near the bid of the last price usually and also look at the bid and it fills and I wonder why my sell is a higher price than what I am seeing for the last time and sales, same with buying. This is because Schwab doesn't list all of the time and sales, so I am not getting all of the current market data to put orders in. I'm sure the sales of my orders go for what the market is going for at the best price since I cannot see all the time and sales on Schwab, and Fidelity shows the price I can see that it's the best price at the time of my order fill.

Okay... back to what I am here to write about. Nov 4th, around 10:15ish AM EST to about 10:19-20ish AM EST, I was looking at Microsoft, MSFT, and Apple, APPL, between SSE and Active Trader Pro. Schwab was showing prices were selling for between $0-2 lower and higher depending on if the candle was green or red, compared to Fidelity. I was timing Fidelity's and Schwab's price action and Schwab was about 20 seconds or so behind in updating what Fidelity was showing, if not more. I manually timed the change in price to Fidelity and that's where I get 20 seconds. This all was happening fast so it was hard to document. I should have screen recorded, but I didn't think of that at the time. In the picture below it shows Fidelity keeping up with the time and sales of the current time and Schwab is 12 minutes behind on the time and sales, but Schwab is only 12 minutes behind on the time part. Schwab was still over a $1 difference than what Fidelity was showing, and this was between $0-$2 difference, the difference fluctuated throughout this 4-5 minute window I was looking at MSFT and AAPL. I only show MSFT here because I only took a screenshot of MSFT. I was looking on the Schwab mobile app, Fidelity's mobile app, and as well as the prices on the internet, Fidelity was showing the right prices. Through these 4-5 minutes, the real price did change $0-2 on Fidelity because of well trading, which was the real price in my eyes. Schwab was behind on the prices.. when AAPL or MSFT was showing green on Fidelity $0-2 change from the opening candle, Schwab was showing red and $0-2 change from its opening candle. Then the opposite was for a red candle on Fidelity.. Schwab was showing a green candle and $0-2 change. It was more towards $1.50 change, there was $2 difference I could see, but not a lot of trades during this time so roughly $1-1.50 was noticeable, but there were trades $2 apart I saw. Schwab's software seems to not be the greatest, or at least just a massive lag during this time. I wish I just recorded my screen because it would have been much better to express what was going on. I loaded up the ""Snipping Tool"" and chose a ""2 second time delay"" for the snipping tool to freeze the screen so I could refresh all of the time and sales window total history for Fidelity before the screen froze. Fidelity's time and sale tape are also visible, I just thought it would be good to have the time and total history sales up as well.

As you can see in the photo below on the right is StreetSmart Edge and on the left is Active Trader Pro. The current time was 9:18 AM CST time for me, so 10:18 AM EST trading time. Schwab is displaying time and sales at 10:06 AM EST while Fidelity is showing 10:18 AM EST which was the current time. Fidelity shows MSFT at the last trade price of roughly $335.22, while Schwab is showing a price of $334.055, while the bid was at $334.04 and ask at $334.06 for Schwab. Fidelity was also showing a bid and ask price around what the real price was going for which was roughly $335.22 at the time. I whited out too much info for the Fidelity side by accident because my account number was showing and I was planning on keeping extra copies of my screenshot but that didn't happen, so this is the only copy I have that I whited out. You cannot see Fidelity's bid/ask prices here, as well as the last traded price of the time and sale tape, but you can see the last traded price above for the total history. Looks like there was an update to the sales when I refreshed the history sales and the time and sales tape, or the total history was faster than the tape. I assure you the bid and ask for Fidelity was around the last traded price of MSFT which was $335.22. Either way, the price for Fidelity is more right and Schwab was Drastically behind. Even though Schwab had the wrong time on their time and sales by 12 minutes the chart was showing being updated to the right time frame, but the prices were off. In this instance, the price difference was $335.22-$334.055 = $1.165. The price was off by more at other times, but for this screenshot, it was $1.165.

I wish I recorded the screen because it would have shown all of the information and would have been better to see what was going on I can tell you that for sure! Fidelity Green or Red by $0-2 and Schwab the opposite by $0-2. I told this information to a Schwab Broker and the problem was fixed after about 10:20 AM EST, but still, this isn't cool. I compared SSE's information with AAPL and MSFT with Fidelity's platform and all was good I believe after 10:20 AM EST. I still checked throughout the day between the two platforms just to make sure, and everything did line up after 10:20 AM EST. Although minutes don't matter in terms of weeks or month-long trading or holding long term if you're day trading or short term trading this matters. I shouldn't be day trading or short-term trading, but I am to make money, and because I want to. This isn't what I want to be seeing from my broker. I should switch to Fidelity after having to experience this. I have used Schwab for my brokerage, Roth IRA, and checking accounts, but maybe it's time for a change. Schwab does have a great platform but it could use updating. I am sure that'll happen when they merge TDA's platform with SSE.

TL:DR: On November 4th, from roughly 10:15 AM to 10:20 AM EST I was comparing Schwab's bid &amp; ask and time &amp; sales to Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform. I compared AAPL and MSFT information, I only took a screenshot of MSFT. Schwab was showing different data in terms of pricing by shown here at $1.165 difference. I was seeing a difference in about $0-2 in sales pricing. I have only one screenshot. I whited out some info but whited out too much info here because I had other copies of my screenshots but accidentally deleted them. Schwab fixed their market prices after I called them, but still not good to be happening on their platform. It's not like this was happening on purpose, it's just something that was happening with Schwab's services. I have used Schwab for mainly all of my investment accounts, but maybe it's time to move. I do like Schwab a lot though. After this, I should probably switch.

1,"11/10/2021, 09:48:52",Is there enough in the tank for $FCEL to run?,Lost-Guarantee229,"**$FCEL  FuelCell Stock Analysis:**

\*You can find supporting visuals in my original post found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/Is-there-enough-in-the-tank-for-FuelCell--FCEL-Stock-to-reach-)\*

**Company Overview:**

$FCEL is a global leader in sustainable clean energy technologies, focusing on energy, safety, and urbanization. FuelCell provides their proprietary hydrogen and carbon capturing technologies, which if commercialized, represents a large opportunity and addressable market. 

FuelCell provides solutions to their business, utilities, and government (and government-related) customers worldwide. These target customers are typically the large-scale power consumers, however there are some smaller-scale customers especially in small European countries. No matter their size or power consumption, FuelCell can craft/provide a solution for them.

FuelCells business model includes 3 main streams of revenues, which include: Power platform/component sales, recurring service revenues, and renewable attribute sales. These streams of revenue will be discussed further in the Investment Information section of this report.

**Investment Information:**

*Long-Term Strategy:*

I believe that this position will be geared to a longer-term hold, and as a result of this ideology, taking a look at their long-term strategy makes the most sense. FuelCell has a 3-pillar long-term growth strategy which covers the following:

1. Transform:

This pillar focuses on building a strong balance sheet that will help them achieve long-term financial health and success. This includes improving their liquidity, which they have already taken strides to doing so in 2020 through their public offering. Typically, public offerings are frowned upon by investors, however, they are using the proceeds to build a foundation/framework to deliver long-term results to their investors. Overall, from a long-term investor standpoint, I do not mind this, as long as it does not get excessive, and they have clear plans for how they plan to use the proceeds. Additionally, FuelCell focused their efforts on getting their cost of borrowing down, which will help them to lower their cost of capital. This should help FuelCell get the funds they need for future projects/expansions, also, this is good for long-term investors as they are making efforts to reduce their cost of capital, which will make the DCF and their business more attractive to long-term investors.

2. Strengthen: 

This pillar focuses on making the necessary investments into enhancing performance, lowering costs, and generating higher returns. Furthermore, this pillar focuses on addressing their backlog to secure stable sources of funding moving forward.

3. Growth:

This pillar focuses on product/service development, FuelCell wants to offer the best products and services, and they believe the best way to do this is through continued R&amp;D efforts. Furthermore, FuelCell is looking to strengthen their customer relationships to generate streams of recurring revenue, and to leverage these relationships into potential expansion opportunities down the line.

*FuelCell Advantages:*

FuelCell has provided the following list of advantages of using fuel cells:

 Fuel Cells can instantly generate electricity from readily available fuels (ie. Natural gas)

 Scalability (especially on-site components)

 Reduced costs 

 Ability to provide carbon-capturing and hydrogen production.

  
 Furthermore, FuelCell has provided the following infographic (found in the original post [here](https://utradea.com/positions/Is-there-enough-in-the-tank-for-FuelCell--FCEL-Stock-to-reach-))which compares Fuel Cells to traditional energy generation techniques. As you can see in the image below, Fuel Cells may not be the best choice for every individual category, however they are by far the best all-around choice for energy generation.

*License Agreements:*

License agreements can provide FuelCell with various benefits especially in their current development stage. The agreements can help them to improve their technologies, at a significantly reduced cost. Currently, FuelCell has 2 License Agreements, which I will quickly cover:

1. ExxonMobil Research &amp; Engineering (EMRE):

FuelCell and EMRE entered into this Agreement on October 31st, 2019, and this agreement states that they will work together to continue research and development efforts in exchange for: 

 A $5M technology access fee (EMRE pays FuelCell), which allows EMRE licenses and rights to the research and development for their own use.

 Up to $45M contributed from (EMRE to FuelCell) for research and development efforts.

 Payments of up to $10M from (EMRE to FuelCell) for reaching set out technological milestones.

 EMRE having certain rights to licenses.

This agreement can help FuelCell to drastically lower their R&amp;D costs while being able to make technological breakthroughs in their product. Although they may be foregoing some revenues now (as Exxon will be able to use these technologies for significant discounts), FuelCell will be able to lower their Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), which will make their services more attractive (lower user costs), which should generate long-term, sustainable revenue streams.

2. POSCO Energy:

FuelCell and POSCO Energy first entered into a Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement (CTTA) in 2012. This agreement gave POSCO the right to manufacture, distribute, and sell select FuelCell products. Part of this agreement includes FuelCell receiving a 3% royalty on POSCOs net product sales and replacement sales. However, in 2019, POSCO spun off the Fuel Cell side of their business and tried to avoid any liability they had to FuelCell as part of their breaching of the contract. Later in 2019, the Korean Electricity Regulatory Committee violated South Korean Laws. In 2020, FuelCell notified POSCO of their breaches of the contract and gave them time to fix it. However, instead of meeting these requirements POSCO decided to go court.

In hindsight, this was a very bad idea as this legal battle dragged on for months, and FuelCell came out victorious and this contract was officially terminated and POSCO had to pay FuelCell all of their legal costs, and the damages FuelCell incurred as a result of the spin-off company (up to $200M).

But the drama did not stop there, as POSCO filed an $800M lawsuit against FuelCell in late 2020 which did not seem to materialize onto anything. 

Overall, FuelCell received $86M of funding from POSCO for research and development efforts since 2007. This funding was crucial for FuelCell and helped them to evolve their products into what they are today.

*R&amp;D Costs with Licensing Agreements:*

Just to show you how much of a financial impact these licensing agreements have on FuelCell, their 2020 total research and development costs were $21.05M, and only 22% of that cost ($4.8M) was paid by FuelCell. These agreements help FuelCell to maintain low operating expenses, while being able to develop the technologies that they are able to develop. Some of their competitors have R&amp;D costs of $35.5M, $27.9M, and $551M. Assuming their R&amp;D costs decrease proportionally with their market cap, these companies would exhibit R&amp;D costs of $17.3M, $4.1M, and $27.6M. This puts FuelCell right on par with their competitor with the lowest (relative) R&amp;D cost.

*Share Dilution:*

FuelCell has a long history of rampant share dilution, and their dilutionary habits still exist today. Just in 2021 alone, FuelCell has increased their # of shares outstanding by over 13%. These levels of dilution are very unfavourable for investors even knowing that there is a large potential for $FCEL to grow into.

One of the biggest factors of this years dilution was through FuelCells Open Market Sale Agreements with Jeffries LLC, and Barclays Capital Inc. This Agreement warrants a total aggregate offering price of up to $500M. With prices near the $10 mark at this point in time, the offering was capable of bringing approximately 50M shares to the market.

Based off of $FCELs shares outstanding data, it appears as though 44M shares were purchased in this offering and are the sole reason for this years share dilution. This announcement of the agreement was the main catalyst in $FCELs 3-month downtrend starting in June of 2021, which decreased the value of their stock by over 50%.

*Revenue Backlog:*

As of FYE 2020, FuelCell had $1.28B in backlogged revenues. In their filing they noted that this revenue could take between 1-20 years to get recognized on their financial reports, however, due to their rapid growth and long term plan, I believe that they can get this done over the next 10 years. This revenue by itself represents the total amount of revenue that FuelCell will generate over the next 10 years. This implies that my DCF model is undervaluing FuelCell, and we will talk about this later.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

As observed in my DCF model (linked below (in my original analysis)), we can see the $FCEL has a fair value of $5.52/share, which implies a downside risk to this investment of 49%. However, from their backlog of revenues, we know that this number is underestimating their revenues, and as a result of this the DCF model will have a 20% weighting toward the overall fair value of FCEL.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*Price to Book (P/B):*

My P/B comparable found the fair value of $FCEL to be $10.12/share, which implies a slight downside risk of 6%. This is very reasonable, and we will see if this is consistent throughout the other comparable ratios.

*Enterprise Value to Sales (EV/Revenue):*

When comparing $FCELs EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, we can find FuelCells fair value to be $6.37/share, which implies a downside risk of 41%. This is not consistent with the previous result and is a rather low estimate. As a result, I underwent one more comparable

*Debt to Equity (D/E):*

$FCELs D/E ratio indicates that their fair value is $30/share, which represents a potential upside of 181%. This is also not consistent with the other results, which led me to taking an average of the 3 comparable analyses. 

Average Comparable:

By taking an average of the comparable analyses, I found $FCELs fair value to be $15.60/share, which indicates an upside potential of 44.5%.

**Overall Valuation:**

By taking a weighted average (20% and 80%) of $FCELs DCF and Comparable valuations respectively, I concluded a final $FCEL price target of $13.10/share. This estimate indicates a 21% upside to this investment.

**Conclusion:**

FuelCell is a quickly growing renewable energy stock that has a good long term growth plan, low R&amp;D costs through their Agreements, and are currently undervalued. The biggest negative about FCEL is their high levels of dilution. Overall, my price target is $15.60/share, which implies a 21% upside.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqj2xr/is_there_enough_in_the_tank_for_fcel_to_run/

2. **No impact to deal flows** \- No customers are refunding/returning any ordered vehicles. Instead, they are keeping the delivered vehicles and will hold them on their premises and wait for Workhorse to fix them on-site. Strong expected deal flow from existing 41+ customers.
3. **Implied confidence in SEC and DOJ investigations -** This is my favorite quote from the CEO regarding the ongoing investigations because he could not comment on the investigations directly. ""I've never seen anyone win a contract while the customer is potentially suing them"" - Rick Dauch, CEO

1,"11/10/2021, 08:17:08",BUY PayPal stock now,liberalvisa,"**BUY PayPal stock now** 

PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)  price was beaten down after a series of events and yesterday the CEO has delivered a weak guidance despite announcing the partnership with Amazon. They are well established, and they have a solid track record with big growth potential. With the current price, it offer investor a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially to buy at a lower price. 

**Lets take a look at PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)** 

**Financial Health - no issue** 

Liabilities - debt to equity ratio of 42.8% (Total debt 8,945 Million / Total Equity 20,905 Million) as at June 30, 2021. *As interest rate is low, it is an excellent strategy to take on more debts to have more rooms for business expansion.* 

Debt Coverage - PayPal is well covered by operating cash flow (64%)

Interest Coverage - PayPal's interest payments on debts are well covered by EBIT (24.7x coverage) 

Cash &amp; Short term investments USD$12.4 billion 

**Earnings - Positive Earning Trend** 

Their profit margin have been growing from 5.2% in year 2014 to 20.4% in year 2021. They have grown significantly by an average of 25% per year over the past 5 years.

High ROE - 23.3% (ROE indicates how well a company's management deploys shareholder capital). 

**Ownership breakdown** 

Institutions make up 82% of majority of ownership and general public of 17.9% . Big institutional / fund house such as Vanguards, Blackrock, state street global advisors are the top shareholders holding majority of the shares.

**Future - Partnership with Amazon**

 PayPal said it had inked a deal with Amazon to allow the firms Venmo wallets in the U.S. to be accepted on Amazons website and mobile app starting next year. Amazon being the largest e-commerce in the world, has **300 million active users** as of (1 November 2021) and **162 million active users** are from US.  Due to Amazons global scope and reach, it is also considered one of the most valuable brand worldwide. This also means that PayPal got to access to Amazon users and the payments can be done through PayPal's Venmo wallets. This is going to be the biggest revenue source going forward. 

**Digitalization  - convenience is part of us now after Covid19** 

Even economies are re-opening, we are every much used to digitalization where we find convenience in purchasing groceries and items online. Even the economy are open, my family and I still find these habits are to stay, we don't physically go to the stores and pick up items that often because I find (1) the prices online are usually more competitive, (2) I do not need to carry large bulky items home (3) whatever I sees in the stores, I will be able to buy online, so if I am not in a rush, I will still get my items online. My family did the same too. 

With Covid19, it had sped up our pace of digitalization, the baby boomer and generation X who are usually not good with computers and mobile applications are forced to use online payments to minimized human contact. Once they got hold of it, the habits are to stay. My mother had learnt to order Amazon Prime for groceries have been very happy with it, she commented that she got competitive prices like other supermarket, and most importantly, the groceries are delivered right to the doorstep without her going out and carrying the items home which she had to persuade my brother to go with her to help her in carrying. Even economy are opening up, she is still going to continue to do that as she had found the conveniences and comfort of online shopping. And prior to Covid19, even amazon prime was around, she had refused to learn to shop online. 

**Forward guidance Vs potential** 

I will think the forward guidance from the CEO, Dan Schulman, is an overstatement. He is trying to manage expectations but it came out badly.

1,"11/10/2021, 08:06:27","Rocket Lab ($RKLB), A Real Rocket to Hop Onto",B_Chep,"There was a small amount of hype for this company last month, but I wanted to remind you in case you got distracted and forgot that this play is a thing, and they have earnings on the 15th. Isn't that exciting?

[It has a rocket on its logo. Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/xwvfwuo4iny71.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7919da585ec69338f00f377f90a18db56919d8d)

Ill list some of my reasons for liking this rocket company.

1. They have received the contract for NASA's first Artemis launch, as NASA begins building the necessary infrastructure for further Lunar missions. They will be putting a single cube sat into a highly technical, unique, lunar orbit launching in March of 2022. This is additionally important because it would be the first time their trademark Electron and accompanying Photon satellite bus would carry a payload to Lunar orbit. That's huge! But why? A lunar orbit has been done plenty of times before (*~~or has it?~~*), well, what if I told you the Electron rocket is one of the most cost affordable rockets available on the market at the moment. The successful launch of a NASA satellite into lunar orbit via an Electron and Photon configuration would open up lunar satellite launches to many different countries, organization's and even private citizens. Forget a lambo, I want my own moon satellite. 
2. The launch window for their next mission, *Love At First Insight,* opens on Thursday night, US time. This will be the first launch of a series of three for the same customer. With a proven track record of successful launches, I spy with my little eye no reason to believe this launch will be any different, except that it will be their first launch since IPO. Additionally, it will be their first live launch including ground experimentation with helicopter recovery.
3. You read that right. Helicopter recovery. Let me clarify, that while they will not be recovering this booster by helicopter, they will be making a dry run at it, to investigate its possibility further, as they already have with static aerial drops. [Rocket Lab | Mid-Air Recovery Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3CWGDhkmbs) As they continue to develop this system, we could see potential that a booster could be recovered by helicopter, landed back on the launch pad to refuel and be inspected, have a new payload added and be launched again. Makes a lot more sense when you consider that Rocket Labs main launch site, the Mahia Launch Complex in New Zealand has potential for a very rapid launch cadence, and so does their Electron Rocket. 
4. Lets look at the bigger picture of what this company is. They're filling a niche market, providing solutions for launches that otherwise would not be economically feasible. They are *not* looking to be SpaceX's competition, although they could someday, if they wanted to, but at the moment, its simply not in their interest. Their Electron rockets are small, agile, and resusable, and can be tailored to almost any low earth orbit.
5. They are currently in development of a larger rocket, Rocket Lab Neutron, which is expected to be operational by 2024 and will launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in New Zealand.
6. I want to mention again that this upcoming launch will be their first launch since IPO, considering that a month after IPO the stock price reached a ATH of $21.34 on Sep 9th, I see it having significant potential to bounce back to these numbers as they keep pushing out more and more news. 

For these reasons, I now consider RKLB to be the best aerospace play of the year, and consider a price target of $25 feasible. Ill be buying more and more while it is still on sale.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqh2hr/rocket_lab_rklb_a_real_rocket_to_hop_onto/

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* As treasuries rose, US stocks paused their longest advance since 2017, bringing key indexes lower from all-time highs.
* The S&amp;P 500 index dipped for the first time in nine sessions, driven by a decrease in banking stocks, which were hit by a drop in the 10-year yield, which fell to its lowest level in seven weeks. Following a tweet by investor Michael Burry, Tesla dropped as much as 13%.
* PayPal dropped after the company's guidance fell short of expectations. General Electric soared after announcing that it would be split into three businesses.
* Investors are weighing robust earnings, easing travel restrictions and US infrastructure expenditure against the possibility of sustained inflation, which might lead to tighter monetary policy. The producer price index rose in October, adding to concerns about inflationary pressures in the economy.
* On Wednesday, new consumer price data could contribute to the monetary policy debate, which saw another surprise on Tuesday with reports that Fed's Brainard was interviewed by Biden as he considers whether to re-appoint Fed's Powell.
* In the meantime, positioning adjustments have spurred advances in long-end Treasuries, bringing the 30-year yield to its lowest level since July. The yield on the US 10-year note has dropped to 1.44%.

Like what if say we just band a bunch of us together and started buying Irish properties and then rented them out at exorbitant prices the same as these cuckoo funds? I feel like it's more complicated than my smooth brain can understand but can we try take this easy money off these fucking assholes I mean I'd much prefer the money coming to us than whoever the fuck a cuckoo fund is. I dunno it might be retarded but I think it's so retarded it just might work.

But has anyone else noticed that a large portion of companies have been falling around the 25% range at earnings this whole quarter? Thats quite a lot to fall, and its happening wether they beat or miss. It doesnt matter how well or bad they do, there has been this trend recently of a 20+% selloff after earnings, on many these large-cap overvalued companies. I dont think this ~20% number is a coincidence. I think there is a very big player, or possibly a group of big players trying to 

1: Slowly deflate the market. 

or

2. Almost entirely exit the market

I think they are trying to do this inconspicuously by hiding their extremely large exits under the guise of the market having an earnings overreaction. Regardless I have the strange feeling someone is trying to exit this market without anyone knowing. Wether theyre out now, or they will continue this slow, earnings deflation idk, im just a schizo theorizing",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqepir/schizo_theory_the_earnings_shroud/

I bought it last week because it seems such an obvious bet. It's winter and gas prices are at an all time high. As a result, the stock has lost 93% since last year but that's exactly what you'd expect from gas prices, right? It seems common sense that there'll at least be some drop in gas prices by next summer and, given how the price is right now, surely this can only go up? 

My holding increased in value by 30% today on the suggestion that gas prices might dip. Now, I'm only holding a few hundred pounds worth but, if prices return to their previous levels, my few hundred pounds would then be worth 7.5k.

Am I missing something here?? Or this is going to be the easiest money I've ever made?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqe70o/short_natural_gas_anyone/

If you look at the short interest charts in the above link, it will give history on sndl stock price push to $3.19 in January.

It showed that shorted shares actually increased in SNDL instead of decreased.

January total shorted shares was 72 million shares shorted at the price of $0.83 

SUNDIAL ON December 23rd had a total outstanding 833 million common shares listed. Since then, it has sold an additional  1,300 Million shares. That is a 156% increase in shares since December 23rd.

As of October 15th, 2021 there were/are 295 million shares shorted.

295m shares  72m shares = 409% increase of shares shorted.

Which means 156% increase of outstanding common shares were listed since December 23rd, but now there is 409% more shares shorted than December 23rd in that ratio.

They have been shorting even more of this stock since its January highs!

As of October 15th report, there are now more shorted shares of sundial than ever before at a total of (295,120,000 shares vrs 286,340,000 shares in September 30th report)

The only way out of this is to purchase enough of those shorted shares to trigger a squeeze. Need to purchase about $160 million worth of shares. I reckon, if sundial does a buyback on the shares, it may trigger a squeeze...

# WISH sells garbage

Yes,  and? What's the problem exactly? MCD is selling garbage and you are  eating it. WMT sells garbage and you go there every week. AMZN sells  garbage (more on this later). Dollar stores sell garbage. NFLX films  garbage. People are dumb. They love garbage. Cheap garbage? Even better.  WISH sells garbage. We get it. They sell lots of garbage. $2.8 billion  worth of garbage!

# Did you ever buy anything on WISH?

Yes  I did. I bought a garbage bin and had no issues with it. The product  was shipped from Chyna, it was just as described and arrived in 2 weeks,  as predicted. Proof: [https://twitter.com/SilbergleitJr/status/1450962281865515009](https://twitter.com/SilbergleitJr/status/1450962281865515009)

# AMZN and WISH sell same stuff

What  most of you idiots don't realize is that you can buy the exact same  items on WISH instead of AMZN for much less. Bezos is selling you the  exact same overpriced Chinese garbage while you complain how WISH is  selling garbage. If you don't realize how stupid you are at this point,  I'm not sure how to help you.

# WISH local sellers

WISH  local pickup model has the potential to become an indexed and  searchable city flea market.  Imagine being able to search all those  small Chinatown stores in your city! Want an indoor plant? Go here. Want  a cheap garden hose extension? Go there. This model cuts down  significantly on shipping times because WISH just directs you to the  nearby store.

# 1Sansome

For  those very few of you that have girlfriends, you may have heard of  Shein. Shein is a Chinese fast fashion retail that sells - you guessed  it - garbage! They are basically a drop shipping business (same as WISH)  as they do not produce their own clothing. They ship exclusively from  China. Shipping times are longer than Amazon Prime. That did not prevent  them to become the largest online-only fashion company in the world!  Why am I telling you all this? Because WISH recently launched 1Sansome  shopping app that is basically a clone of Shein. Heck, even models are  the exact same! Go to both of their websites and you will realize what  I'm telling you. They are giving free garbage to Instagram and TikTok  hotties to fuel this thing until they become a recognizable name among  girls who propelled Shein to the clouds.

# Conclusion

I  said what I need to say. I put my money where my mouth is. Positions or  ban. I'm not afraid to show my red WISH positions because I know  ""scared money makes no money"". Before bashing, calling me a pumper,  bagholder, share your WISH short positions or GTFO.

A target hit would endorse and encourage FEDs continued tapering of 15b reduction in asset purchases and the timeline of hike in interest rates which are both contractionary monetary policies. Bearish.

A target miss on the upside might signal further stagflation impacting primarily the middle/lower class consumer spending. Tapering would still ensue most likely. Bearish.

A target miss on the lower side (unlikely) might signal an accelerated speed of tapering and a pull on the time horizon on interest hike lowering aggregate supply of money. Very Bearish.

I have spent the past 10 months digging into Kenneth Griffin, of Citadel LLC, and have publicly written over a 100 pages discussing my journey doing so. During this journey, I discovered, with tangible mathematical proof, that Kenneth Griffin is operating the United States Government Trading Markets, and other Art and Collectors Markets, as an International Ponzi Scheme. I have uploaded audio versions of my journey onto my SoundCloud here: [https://soundcloud.com/matador33](https://soundcloud.com/matador33)

As of right now, I am one of, if not the number one, leading edge artists in the NFT market because of this. In the world. The amount of public support I have for this just continues to grow.

 

I also sent two pitchforks by mail to Kenneth Griffin so that he is aware of me.

 

And I renounced all United States Government's Claims of Authority and Laws from applying to me.

 

Along with all other Authoritative Bodies that exist in the World.

 

I am the only one who can do this, because this is a solo art project that I own.

 

I have also posted my personal address online, and have publicly told Kenneth Griffin to come send someone to harm me, because I am not afraid of him.

 

This shit is way bigger than me.

 

My argument is, I'm allowed to do this, and anything I want to because:

 

I reached out to my elected officials on this issue starting in February. I have not had a single reply.

I have reached out to the SEC, FTC, FBI, FINRA, and other regulatory agencies about these issues over the course of this project. I have not had a single reply.

I have publicly declared that I am playing an Alternate Reality Game. You can't get arrested and charged for shooting someone in a video game like Grand Theft Auto 5. I can't get arrested or charged for anything I do while playing my ARG Game (I have metaphorically removed my consciousness and being into a different reality, like I said, it's philosophical, but it's all based on sound logic).

I have been insanely open about this since the start of the project. I have publicly told the SEC, etc. that I would do this if they did not get involved. Everything, from my thought processes, to decisions I thought I'd have to make, all posted online, it's all posted online. And has been going on for months, and no one has officially told me I have had to stop, so I think that warrants precedent that it is okay to continue to do so.

(This art project is a statement on the unfair access of information and education for the poor vs. the wealthy, along with just broader wealth gap issues in general. It IS an art project, first and foremost).

 

Some of those posts have been removed, or have had expected paid bad actors post comments and messages to try to discredit my character. I have so much evidence of this. I am still being handed more on a plate as I type out this letter. There is a lot of speculative evidence that Ken Griffin bankrolls this to happen, not just to me, but millions of people who have actually intelligent things to say online.

 

The media portrayal of me as a ""dumb money investor"" shows that the media, and as an extension society, does not have my best interest in mind. So I must do what is best for me, as an individual.

 

I publicly posted this project on reddit, in their r/Art community. In it, I stated the universe was my medium. Posting online is an action that facilitates copyrights for the artist or author posting online. If I own the universe, I own the rules.

 

I have put an insane amount of thought into this.

 

This is going to upend the legal world, and the entire rest of the world. This is Michael Burry shit times 1,000.

 

My next step in this Game is to wait for Ken Griffin to sue me, or for me to get arrested.

 

If I go to court, all of his evidence goes to court.

 

I purposely built this fail safe. He is tied to me in this. And I want him in prison, honestly, I want him charged with treason at the highest level. I spent 10 months digging into this man's life. Please, hear me out before you think I am being too severe.

 

The narrative of the case that I am building is this: 

I have the right to express my art in my choosing, and 

As an artist I also get to claim the profits from my sales, even subsequent ones. 

Why don't I get royalties? If a rich hedge fund owner buys my work, and then turns around and sells it for 100x the price, why do they get to profit from my work? You need to understand that, while that has not personally happened to me, it is happening to the art world as a whole. And I take it very personally.

 

I am also claiming that Kenneth Griffin is negatively affecting the price of the NFTs tied to this project, because of his manipulation in the markets, and in the subreddit forums I post in.

 

Those are three of the biggest issues I want to address if this goes to court.

 

How many video games and cartoons make fun of famous people? That is what I am right now, at least in the eyes of the law, and I have 100 pages of proof of how and why I can claim that. My life, legally, has, metaphorically, become a cartoon.

 

I have put a lot of thought into this, guys.

 

I also refuse to accept a single penny of profit from the artwork I have tied this all to. I've already publicly declared that I have tied contracts to them, and those contracts state I must donate all the money from them to specific non-profit organizations. This is a matter of principle for me.

 

If you think I am just being crazy, please, fucking tell me. I have been begging people to disprove my argument for months. No one has been able to yet. This art project has been seen by thousands.

 

I have full belief in my ability to win this case.

 

I have faith in the people, some who have watched me take all the steps to do this since January, 2021, to agree with my statements on all these issues, publicly.

 

\*\*\*\*\*

 

To try to clear it up as simple as possible:

 

I made an online investigative journalist report, that I intend to turn into a full book, that also coincides with the implementation and creation of multiple Alternate Reality Games and Performance Arts, all backed by multiple NFTs. (Non-fungible tokens - Online Artworks backed by Blockchain Technology)

 

I did this to legally protect myself while manipulating the stock market away from Kenneth Griffin. 

 

Every single layer to this is Art.

 

This is no different than Hunter S. Thompson.

 

This is no different than Joaquin Phoenix in I'm Still Here.

 

I just have more layers of protection, because I have multiple layers of art.

 

To make it overly clear:

 

I am declaring my life an art project. Anything I do is a part of that art project, so I am protected under my First Amendment Right of The U.S. Constitution, which I also believe is an unalienable Right that transcends all countries and borders. This is unarguable.

 

I also own the proprietary rights on this art project. Which means no one else can make the claims I am. This is to protect from future people trying to do the same as me. This is dangerous territory I am adventuring into. I do not want people to follow me.

 

My claims are:

 

I have proprietary ownership of the collective human hivemind (This is so I can sue, or hold accountable in any other way, any company that creates fake online bot accounts for the purpose of civil unrest or discontent in the future).

 

I have proprietary ownership of the space-time continuum that exists after Wednesday, November 3th, 2021, until I say otherwise. (This is the moment I am claiming I ""moved my piece"" in the Game. It is the moment I sent Kenneth Griffin two pitchforks using the entire world's centralized economies, and I am claiming this action changed the forward motion of the universe, down a completely different path than what it was) (I wrote 21 pages explaining why I can claim this, The Divine Joys of Poking a Bear audio covers it) (This is what gives my Logistical NFT it's tangible worth).

 

These two claims are also backed by an NFT that I announced I would be minting, which I also appraised to be worth $147 Trillion. I plan to fractionalize this, 147 Trillion times, and sell it at a penny each, to raise $1.4 Trillion dollars for world hunger and homelessness.

 

I have publicly stated constantly that this is all an art performance, none of this advocates violence, and it is strictly an investigative and sociological look into the Cultural and Socio-Economic issues facing my life as an artist today. 

 

I have also unequivocally denied being a part of any other affiliations or groups, whether Political, Financial, or Religious (I get accused of this kind of stuff the most, and as I explained above, I think it's a discredit tactic put onto reddit either directly or indirectly by Kenneth Griffin).

 

This isn't something that is a political issue, it gets solved in the courts. 

 

It gets solved by the people.

 

We get to make the new laws. We get to build a better world for everyone. 

 

Together.

 

 

 

 

 

 

\*\*\*\*\*\*

 

These were the types of comments I was getting on my artwork, for months, before having my ability to post on reddit clearly be manipulated, and brigaded by user accounts that do not facilitate positive discussion on this issue. 

 

""This needs so much more attention than it's getting.

It's really fucking fantastic.""

 

""I couldn't stop reading. Thank you.""

 

""This is fucking glorious.""

 

""Matador,

Thank you. I felt every word you wrote in this letter. I have an overwhelming sense of emotion after completing the read that I just cant describe. I am not fucking alone in this and I cant stop crying because for so long I have felt alone. You have helped connect so many dots over the last year I couldnt help but think at times I was absolutely crazy, brainwashed, or just stupid for believing internet strangers This was what I needed this morning. I needed to read every word of those beautifully written 21 pages. I hope Kenneth does too.""

 

""Holy shit that gave me chills. Thank you for taking the time to make this. I hope as many see it as possible. I don't have a single ounce of the skill you have with words, I literally don't think I have it in me to describe how this made me feel. Thank you sir, you truly are an artist.""

 

""I will leave this here for legal purposes. I do believe that what you created was art. It exists as a type of mimicry that speaks for reality. As they say, art mimics reality, and reality mimics art. You are blessed to have figured this out. Your strength of will is a blessing to us.""

 

As proof that I have been public and open about this, I am showing a comment I made during The First Hypothetical ARG Experience I held. I publicly posted this comment on July 31st, 2021:

 

""The issue with the NFT play is that it requires that last buy/sale price to set market value for collateral.

 

Or it requires proving to the Civil Admins that the market value is being tampered with, which damages that NFTs ability to get fair value, leaving the Shadow Users potentially on the hook for the potential price of the NFT, if the Civil Admins side with the Player.

 

It's wild west as fuck.""

[Look at the shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BBBY), its sitting at 100M. If you don't know what that means, consider it the free floating stocks available that are being held by people and can be traded at any moment. Meaning can be bought and sold anytime. Now, here's the important part: [A few days ago they announced an absolute fuckton of money to be spent on buying back their own stock.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/bed-bath-beyond-soars-on-share-buybacks-plans-for-marketplace) 400M worth. 

With a market cap of 2.18B, that's  0.4/2.18 = 18% of their whole market cap. THAT IS INSANE. If your tits aren't already perked up from hearing this consider the sharp reduction in shares float. $400M tendies / $21.64 share price = 18.5M shares. Taking this off of shares float is, similarly, an 18% concentration of stock we'll see. Normally this means nothing. AMD is doing a buyback program along with MSFT and several others. So what makes this different?

 a) the sheer investment/market cap ratio. AMD for example is $4B investment/ 180B market cap = 2%. thats dogshit. 

and more importantly

 b) the fact that they want to complete this buyback program by the end of February. The short duration of it is the most critical aspect of this because that means this upward trajectory is going to be aggressive as fuck! And it means it can be calculated. 

If you're still confused I'ma need you to add another wrinkle right now in that peewee brain because what this means is that there will be less sellers and more buyers as more shares are kept with the big boi company itself. 

reasons to buy in:

1) an enormous amount of capital thrown at itself increasing market cap by 18%

2) a sharp concentration of stock since float will be reduced by 18%

3) execs are showing how big their balls are with their confidence in our face because they're strongly suggesting they think the company will keep growing. 

4) bitch will moon by February

So whats the play? We're going with the May 20th, 2022 Calls at the $23 strike. I look forward to seeing your posts of thicc gains.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqc3sa/dd_inbound_bullish_projections_on_bbby/

Lemonade is an industry changer for insurance. They use AI and ML to make it faster for you to get insurance payments. They make it so you dont spend 5 hours on hold waiting for an insurance agent by getting rid of the agent, getting you money faster and charging you less for the insurance plan.

Lemonade has already been growing rapidly in housing insurance (my house is insured with Lemonade) and they just launched car insurance last week and jumped into the industry with an acquisition this week (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/metromile-stock-rallies-13-after-lemonade-announces-acquisition-11636408552). This company is seeing rapid growth and has already demonstrated huge potential, spiking to $180 stock price already within the last year before settling back down to \~$63 where it is at the time of this writing (on sale after the acquisition).

LMND is already a good stock, but on top of that Wall Street built a rocket for us and pre-loaded it with nitro. WallStreet over-extended again (just like GME and AMC) and it is time to catch them with their shorts down (literally and metaphorically).

Currently LMND is shorted for \~36% of its shares (13,540,000 shares). The average daily volume for LMND is 2.2M shares, which makes days to cover 10.5 days. [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LMND/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LMND/short-interest/)

Not only that, but Motley Fool agrees that this is prime territory for a squeeze: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/08/lemonade-is-ripe-for-short-squeezing/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/08/lemonade-is-ripe-for-short-squeezing/) 

WallStreetBets currently has 11.1M members. So what do we have to do to take these shorts hostage? If every ape here only bought 3 shares for \~$200 total, we would own all of LMND and Wall Street would be forced to pay whatever ransom price we ask in order for them to get out.

Apart from the regularly updated positions, I couldn't find much about his thesis. I could see that majority of redditors were against the trade, advising to get out asap while he kept his composure during red days. The only thing he mentioned is that his thesis aligns with Burry's.

On August 16, 2019 Burry wrote a letter to GME management, here is the excerpt:

*As mentioned in our previous letter to the board, we have concerns regarding capital management at GameStop. Given recent GameStop common stock prices under $4 per share, we must re-state that GameStop complete the remaining $237,600,000 share repurchase at once and with urgency.*

*Given the market capitalization of GameStop at $290 million at the close on August 15th, completing the authorization would retire over 80% of GameStops outstanding shares. Depending on the timing and quality of execution, such a repurchase would increase earnings per share dramatically - far more than any other possible action on a* *per share* *basis.*

*The numbers are striking and demand action. We estimate that GameStop now has in excess of $480 million of cash, more than enough to complete the share repurchase authorization and still invest in the business and pay down debt.*

Seems to me the most important DFV and Burry's thesis was how much cash on hands GME had, while short position were betting on dying business and expecting this cash to evaporate quickly. How did DFV and Burry see the future of the company whose main business is dying - selling games on CD? Why did they have such a strong conviction apart the cash-on-hands?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqb0r1/what_made_dfv_have_such_a_high_conviction_on_gme/

1,"11/10/2021, 02:59:45",The german degenerates need your help ($BNTX),PapaMusk18,"Fellow retards, 

I'm speaking to you for one reason: I come from the subreddit r/mauerstrassenwetten, something like wsb for german retards. We are 114k degenerates, just as retarded as you are... 

All of us like the stock Biontech. If you dont know Biontech, you probably lived under a rock for the last two years. They produce, in cooperation with Pfizer, the best vaccine for Covid-19 out there. They use the MRNA method, which is the most complex method. 

You're probably thinking right now, what does this retard want from me and why does he show me a company that produces a vaccine for a virus, which we might not need anymore in the near future? 

The answer is, that Biontech is Biotech company that could find new medications for other viruses and diseases because they plant a blueprint for your antibodies in your body. A short retarded way to describe the Mrna method, I know. So they have a huge potential in the future.

 [here a more detailed explanation of MRNA](https://biontech.de/covid-19-portal/mrna-vaccines) 

[future plans of BionTech](https://biontech.de/de/science/platforms)

And let's not forget Corona is not over yet. Here in Germany the question of a third booster vaccination. Also they reported earnings today and what can I say, they fucking smashed it. That's why they rose 4% in German exchange this morning. When your markets opened today, they dropped -6% and I can't understand why: 

 revenue was 13,444.2 million last nine months (136.9 million. in 2020)

earnings per share 13.14 (estimated 12.27) 

[if you want more detail](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001776985/000177698521000008/bntx3q2021pressrelease_dra.htm)

So there are only two options why $BNTX falls, hedgies or everything was priced in. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I ecourage you, to help your fellow retards from Germany, to push Ugur back to $400, because they earn it.

WHY??,LAOGX,"Because this low cost, tried and true protein subunit vaccine has the potential to vaccinate the world, rich and poor, and the mRNA vaccine hesitant or those with medical such as blood clotting concerns. Anyone else ready to go against Goliath again for some honest gains in a good company? Any thoughts?

Novavax has a vaccine shown to be highly effective against the COVID-19 coronavirus and against variants at decent percentages compared to the mRNAs. They are just began completing submissions for emergency use authorizations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and plan to submit for the United States by the end of the year 2021 landing at end of December 2021. They have received around 1.6 Billion dollars from the Trump administrations operation warp speed. Their headquartered in Maryland. They have partnered with the Serum Institute of India, the largest vaccine supplier to scale production of vaccines. 

There are lawsuits against claims from Politico anonymous sources article in October, I recall, that are refuted to be exaggerated and inaccurate information about their quality and production ability. They already have millions of vaccines stockpiled and have advanced purchase orders. They will have tiered pricing to accommodate low income nations and wealthier nations. 

NOVAVAX has been granted emergency use authorization in Indonesia and is pending the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the World Health Organization after their excellent and very positive human trials in the UK. 

Why is this company expected to loose? Shouldnt their profits only vastly increase as they get approvals nation by nation. 

They are also a viable booster vaccine to people who have used other vaccines against COVID-19. Lastly, NVAX has also created a combo seasonal influenza and COVID-19 jab that has the same effective proprietary Matrix adjuvant that stimulates immune response. 

For those who are unaware, the protein subunit vaccine is different from an mRNA vaccine. 

The mRNA instructs muscle cell ribosomal conscription to manufacture COVID-19 protein spikes and creates a cytotoxic cell surface expression where your bodies T cells recognize the cell as hostile and mutant and destroys those muscle cells to gain and be taught immunity. 

The protein subunit vaccine doesnt hijack human cells for covid protein spikes but instead uses insect cells to create the spikes. These spikes are then harvest and attached to nanoparticle shells to mimic the covid virus shape and combines it with their immune stimulating adjuvant that alerts the T cells to destroy the FOREIGN material that was injected into the body, creating immunity.

I believe this stock will be trading around $18 by the end of the week. Momentum has increased around METAverse related stocks such as AMD and NVDA as well as FB. While the idea of creating a meta verse is not new; it will continue to gain momentum in the coming months and years.

Metaverse/Omniverses will not be created overnight; however, we can continue to see increase activity surrounding these ideas.

1,"11/10/2021, 01:24:01",$agen,Willydip,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.


Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.

Below, we take a look at Agenus (AGEN), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.

It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Agenus currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.


You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;


Set to Beat the Market?

Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AGEN that show why this biotechnology company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.

A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.

For AGEN, shares are up 1.26% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.42% compares favorably with the industry's 3.77% performance as well.

While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Agenus have risen 45.21%, and are up 38.83% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 14.7% and 8.41%, respectively.

Investors should also take note of AGEN's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AGEN is averaging 2,598,550 shares for the last 20 days.


Earnings Outlook

The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AGEN.

Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AGEN's consensus estimate, increasing from -$1.14 to -$1.05 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.

Bottom Line

Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AGEN is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Agenus on your short list.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LMND/short-interest/

Do you hate insurance? Me too. So why am I recommending an insurance stock to you? Because Lemonade is a new kind of insurance ready to kick the old guys in the pants and put some money in our pockets. So, lets do this thing

Lemonade is an industry changer for insurance. They use AI and ML to make it faster for you to get insurance payments. They make it so you dont spend 5 hours on hold waiting for an insurance agent to tell you they wont give you money and they cut out all these pesky insurance agents trying to give you as little money as possible, thus making your insurance cost less because you arent footing the bill for the agents who rob you.

Lemonade has already been growing rapidly in housing insurance (my house is insured with Lemonade) and they just launched car insurance last week and jumped into the industry with an acquisition this week (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/metromile-stock-rallies-13-after-lemonade-announces-acquisition-11636408552). This company is seeing rapid growth and has already demonstrated huge potential spiking to $180 stock price already within the last year before settling back down to \~$67 where it is at the time of this writing.

LMND is already a good stock, but on top of that Wall Street built a rocket for us and pre-loaded it with nitro. WallStreet over-extended again (just like GME and AMC) and it is time to catch them with their shorts down (literally and metaphorically). They are trying to shut down the easy insurance that actually pays us for our claims because they are trying to keep the old guys who scam us of our money in play.

Currently LMND is shorted for \~36% of its shares (13,540,000 shares). The average daily volume for LMND is 2.2M shares, which makes days to cover 10.5 days. [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LMND/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LMND/short-interest/)

Not only that, but Motley Fool agrees that this is prime territory for a squeeze: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/08/lemonade-is-ripe-for-short-squeezing/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/08/lemonade-is-ripe-for-short-squeezing/) 

WallStreetBets currently has 11.1M members. So what do we have to do to take these shorts hostage? If every ape here only bought 3 shares for \~$200 total, we would own all of LMND and Wall Street would be forced to pay whatever ransom price we ask to get out. They will start getting margin-called as the stock price rockets up and they could take us to the moon!

If WallStreetBets heavily invested in LMND, the stock price could easily double to $140 and I believe that it could rocket as high as $400 in a couple of days. If we perform a gamma squeeze also targeting this Friday or next Friday, this could maybe be our $1000",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq8i5j/the_new_gme_lmnd_short_squeezing_lemons_into/

Regulators are concerned that  video-game like prompts have encouraged excessive trading on app-based  brokerages that fueled a explosive surge in value for GameStop Corp. and  other stocks this year.

Amazon and Ford owns a percentage of Rivian which means they see something in this company. Personally, I dont care who backs them up. If Rivian vehicles sucks and the consumer thinks it sucks and it doesnt meet expectations then it isnt worth anything. Just another EV company. Now, if the loyalty base is strong and enough shareholders stick with it this company can become something just like Tesla or perhaps be worth more than Tesla.

Earlier today (11/9) it was [announced](https://investors.progenity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/progenity-appoints-adi-mohanty-chief-executive-officer) that Adi Mohanty was appointed as Progenitys ($PROG) Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Adi Mohanty is an experienced biotech business leader with a track record of several successful product development and approvals followed by rapid commercialization. Previously, he served as CEO of BioTime what is now known as Lineage Cell Therapeutics. During his tenure, the company advanced its platform science to develop product candidates from the lab into mid- and late-stage clinical trials and unlocked value through strategic transactions, resulting in a better-capitalized company, poised to build substantial value for shareholders through renewed focus on clinical progress.

Adi formerly served as vice president at Transkaryotic Therapies, which was acquired by Shire PLC. Throughout a decade at Shire, he held several executive positions spanning global technical operations, product development, and commercial operations, culminating in the role of President, Regenerative Medicine.

**NEW Board of Directors Appointment**

Five days ago, Progenity [announced](https://investors.progenity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/progenity-announces-appointment-jill-howe-its-board-directors) the appointment of Jill Howe to its Board of Directors. Ms. Howe was also appointed chairperson of the Audit Committee and member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

In a statement from the interim CEO, Eric dEsparbes, Eric stated As Progenity continues to execute its strategic transformation, we are adding key leadership capabilities that will allow us to continue accelerating our efforts to develop the drug discovery and delivery systems of the future, Jill brings proven financial leadership and extensive pharmaceutical industry experience, which will be invaluable in her role as chair of the Audit Committee for Progenity.

Its an exciting time for Progenity as there is incredible depth and potential in the R&amp;D pipeline, said Jill Howe. I look forward to working with the team to ensure the companys potential is valued.

Upcoming Earnings Report

[Progenity](https://investors.progenity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/progenity-report-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-and) is set to report third quarter 2021 financial results on Wednesday, November 10, 2021 after the close of financial markets. Progenitys management will host a webcast and conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT that day to discuss the financial results and provide a corporate update.

**Its mission**

Molecular testing biotech Progenity (NASDAQ: PROG) stock was pummeled by the pandemic as its testing revenues were slashed in half. With the acceleration of COVID-19 vaccination, the maker of pregnancy and diagnostic testing kits is seeing revenues improve. The Company has repositioned itself as a biotech play betting on its Preecludia test. The test would be the first U.S. preeclampsia rule-out test. Preeclampsia affects over 700,000 women annually and is the second leading cause of maternal mortality. The Company made a strategic transformation to focus on oral delivery of biomedicals and gastrointestinal health. The Company received a U.S. patent for assessing preeclampsia using assays for free and disassociated placental growth factors. Even more promising is the granting of patents in regard to its ingestible therapeutics technology which is the Progenity Oral Biotherapeutic Delivery System. This is an ingestible capsule that can deliver large molecules to targeted areas instead of by injection. The Company severely diluted its share to raise cash and lower debt.

But there were some really good nuggets in there. 

The average stock doesnt go up over long periods of time. The average stock will eventually go down 100% 
Indexes work because they weed those out and replace them

Shorting stocks is actually mathematically in your favor and thats one of the secrets i have, that you have to search deeply for
His sample portfolio was 40% long 40% short 20% cash he believes in being cash heavy.

How often should you trade stocks? 
If you own a stock for 10 dollars and you think its worth 20 you want it to happen as fast as possible because of opportunity cost 
I would rather make 20% in two weeks then 100% in 2 years 
As long as you have other opportunities 

If you think everything is overvalued or under valued 
You kind of suck and your process is not correct 
8/10 stocks should be fairly valued

I studied pharma that helped me invest in biotech stocks thats more important then 13f filings and listening to cnbc 
The information I got from working in pharma
Made the 13f filings look like useless garbage in comparison


The CEO is one of the most important factors, do you trust him to make big profits 10 years from now? 

Where boys Become men 
Most analysts dont understand this
Apples 
100 billion ev
33 billion in profit 
Is 33% on your money 
Its a calculation warren uses
( this was years ago ) 


You have to look at all stocks 
Imagine going to a restaurant and only eating one dish out of 800 dishes 
And saying this is the best dish for sure! 
You have to try the other dishes to get perspective and to maybe find something even better

 USA has more fairly valued companies in general, International stocks 
Are either super undervalued or overvalued.
Thats what you want so you can buy undervalued and short overvalued

I feel bad for people who look at p/e 
If Tesla is worth 50 billion 
And has 1 million in net profit it doesnt mean it has 50 k p/e and should be avoided 

I like companies who make people think with a different part of there brain. 
Like Apple and Tesla.
They dont care about price they just have to have it. 
Usually great marketing, great design and product. 
With a great design comes a big price 

 very few people short sell
It could be good a lot of the time 
In 2000-2012 you wouldnt make a penny if you were long. 
Markets go down often 

You want to be as diversified as you can

Dont invest if you dont have a good idea.
Hedge funds are forced too invest 

Have a margin of safety



Discount rate is gold 
Its theoretical 
Basically you guess what growth they will have looking at the history of the company and you guess how long the company will stay alive. 
How much cash will it bring in, in its whole lifetime.
So Apple for example might bring in 300 billion a year in profit times 20 years.
Giving it a value of 6 trillion. 



But its all theoretical 
It might live for 30 years 
It might get a worse profit growth 
It might shrink by 15% per year instead of 2% 
You dont know 
You give them a discount rate based on how risky the investment is how diversified they are and how easy is it to eat there lunch.
This could take years as an investor to calculate correctly

1,"11/10/2021, 00:20:46",$ARQQ Arqit Quantum Stock: Massive Return Potential By Future Proofing Cybersecurity (ARQQ),bdkendalll,"Quantum computing in the near future will usher in huge advances in technology and perhaps transform how we go about our daily lives for the better. The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when.  The Global Risk Institute released a report titled ""Quantum Threat Timeline"" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034.  Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.  For reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date.  A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to ""harvest now, decrypt later"" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available. It has even been theorized that the entire blockchain that cryptocurrencies depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity.  This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data.  Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.  The technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come.  The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch. With current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year.  To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO [himself.To](https://himself.To) land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an ""unnamed"" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.  During recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company.  Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.  In addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already.  The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%.  If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1 billion market cap.  It also would appear, counter to many of the recent SPAC IPOs, that dilution should not be an issue going forward. In the SPAC transaction, the company has received $376 million in cash to the balance sheet, to which the CEO recently commented that the deal brought it ""twice the money that we need to fully fund our business"" and that ""We don't need to raise any more money, ever,"" he told CNBC.  In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.  So far, I have not found any true red flags with Arqit, but as I am not a cybersecurity expert, I will be keeping my position moderately sized until at least a few quarters have run off and I gain a greater comfortability with the progress of the technology and management.  I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed. If they are successful in the product roll out, shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely.  I look forward to your comments and views of the company, thank you for reading and good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq77lv/arqq_arqit_quantum_stock_massive_return_potential/

This is definitely going to be controversial between a lot of people as there really is no middle ground when it comes to the future of EV. Hopefully this quick rant will point some of you in the right direction. 

Big issues I see with Ford, debt, and future capacity which tie together. Everyone knows EV is where we are headed, now some people might disagree but youd most likely be wrong. With that said the most successful EV maker will be decided by who is selling the most EV (ideally) at the highest margins. 

Lets look at Ford current and future capacity. Ford is on track to make 50k EV this year, by 2025 they estimate they will have capacity for 1m EV, and an even more depressing estimate for 2030. I think these numbers are hilarious and if this is where they are headed they might as well give up now. To make this argument a little less of a joke lets say they make 2m by 2025. (Only 200k are estimated to be F150L by 2026) 

Lets hope they plan on making a few more EV than that as demand is clearly already above this. So they need more capacity, need more EV factories, this is where debt comes in. Over 100 billion, yea a fucking retarded amount of debt. Where is this debt gonna go? Its not going anywhere, its getting worse. The need for capacity leads more factories meaning Ford will be taking on more and more debt to stay relevant in the changing space. 

All of this will be happening in the short term, next 5 years, while ICE sales continue to dwindle until they amount to nothing. But yea the F150 is the best selling truck in America so moon. 

A little side note; 
2020: 500k
2025: 5m
2030: 20m

1,"11/10/2021, 00:02:54",The EV Battery Company You All Overlooked,RDBx1,"Standard Lithium Ltd is the most underrated lithium mining/producing company in America. They are located in Arkansas on a 150,000 acre Bromine mine (in cooperation with Laxness) that is considered to be one of the richest places for lithium resources in the United States. At this time they are also the only domestic lithium plant running, as companies like Albemarle have taken overseas positions. They have had a recent economic evaluation and are predicted to produce somewhere around 30,000 tons of lithium per year (price per tonne of lithium carbonate is $13,000). Most Lithium companies in the United States at this time won't be able to produce half of what $SLI will produce in a year. By as early as 2025 there is predicted to be a gap of demand for Lithium and I see Standard Lithium coming out in front in this race because of the geographical position and the large amount of supply they will have on hand. 

Standard Lithium has a very strategic advantage in the placement of their company. They are only a few miles away from major EV companies such as TESLA, Ford and a few other EV manufacturers. With the most supply for the upcoming demand, as well as the quickest refining process known to Lithium, I think that this company will sky rocket very soon and you should be on that rocket heading to the moon.

I'm going to try and keep this short since I could talk about the reasons for hours, but I lack the attention span.

Now I know this stock has been heavily beaten during covid, it has been heavily shorted (41.92% of float according to Yahoo Finance). **Anything over 20% is considered high**. Also, suffering from the supply chain issue, and the chip shortage, which are all temporary issues, that's why I think this is a value play. 

**Long story short, I believe based on the recent price movement before and after earnings, and the already high short interest, the price is as low as it can get and its a good time to start a position.**

Even with all the issues, they still grew net earnings for **Q3 2021 (391.1M)** compared to **Q3 2019 (284.4M), it dipped** AND **""Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, was $1.393 billion, an increase of 21.6% year over year"".** If you read the latest earnings report, management isn't worried, and even under the current challenges they are still producing results. 

**I love this quote:** ""Based on outside data, we believe that we gained market share in most categories in Q3. Since the start of 2021, we've maintained an astounding pace of innovation launching 113 new products, including the addition of several entirely new product lines, which we believe has greatly expanded our total addressable market opportunity."" new products include webcams and gaming monitors, **""which we believe has greatly expanded our total addressable market opportunity"".** Since these products just came out I don't think its priced in as of yet. 

The play for me is to buy shares. The average trading volume on Yahoo Finance is: **1.56 million.** Which makes it easy for shorts to pin the stock price down. **BUT luckily for us, it means the stock is cheap and any significant uptick in volume will shoot the stock up potentially causing a squeeze, I just don't know when, thats why I'll just buy and hold shares. If you time calls correctly I think this would be a multi-bagger. I might buy some calls later on.**

Last thing that I see mentioned and needs to be addressed is the Eagletree shares. I don't see this as a big issue. They been selling at the $35 mark which means even Eagletree, who bought in at $6.50, thinks its currently undervalued. Worst case scenario, it's still a 35% upside, way more with calls. I'll probably trim my position or buy some puts and see what happens. 

**TLDR: damn i tried to keep it short, left out the basic fundamental stuff, I have already seen posted**

**- Already heavily shorted 42%, and price is now cheap**

\- Gaming industry and demand will only continue to grow

\- Supply chain issues, chip shortage are temporary, have been a known issue for a while now and already priced in

\- This is a company that is actively trying to expand their product line and increase their total addressable market cap, are confident their products will lead to more growth

**Unless you see gaming going away in the future, I think Corsair is a good value play at this price.** 

Position: 1000 shares @ $25.80, just buy and hold baby. Calls if your feeling spicy",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq6t22/easy_value_play_another_gaming_company_being/

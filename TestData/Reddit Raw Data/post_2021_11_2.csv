Its heavily owned by institutions and I noticed the other day that the stock dropped in the aftermarket before some bad news came out. It seems as though its being heavily manipulated to get the public to sell all their shares before these institutions buy back at a great discount. The true value is at 5.40 but its sitting at 4.40 at the time of posting. Its had multiple instances within the past 5 years where it has a sudden drop with no significant reason and then it immediately jumps back up a bit. Also, the news that came out yesterday was that ivc was getting dropped from the s&amp;p 600, which is long overdue in my opinion. This wouldnt even drop the price by one percent, but its down ten percent since yesterday. The funny thing is that the news got released five minutes after the big drop.

So I've been watching the GME chart since yesterday when I stumbled on it and noticed the crazy price action. So yesterday it ripped right through R1 and R2 (pivot points) and bounced between R3 and VWAP all morning at which point I figured it would make a decisive move up or down around 1pm (since VWAP was closing in on R3). At 12:30 pm it started using R3 as support (which is retarded) and that's when that 30 minute run from $194 to $208 happened.

&amp;#x200B;

[3 bounces off VWAP and using R3 as support before running to $208](https://preview.redd.it/lqqndf95e7x71.png?width=1357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55a7e0c19a05ee68c682140e1875e93b28fe2275)

Today's R1 is at $212. At that point it will might get rejected back to VWAP ($201 right now) before bouncing back up to $212 or falling back to $196 (daily pivot).

But this volume chart is very bullish (look at those volume candles at 11-11:15am).

If it holds R1, then we head into straight up tarded territory. It would likely run to R2, which is $225. If you guys remember, $225 was where it ran during that one day in August before getting rejected. If it holds $225, then there could be a squeeze. I mean we're in uncharted territory at that point and I genuinely have no idea what will happen next.

Bharet had a meeting with the WHO last week and the WHO came back asking about more data and set a follow up for Wednesday November 3. Bharet submitted the additional data yesterday and is expected to get the nod from the WHO tomorrow. Expectation is for it to hit $20-$25 tomorrow, then the FDA also has all paperwork from Ocugen. In the coming weeks, FDA should be approving this vaccine for kids and adults. This should get over $35!!

Despite this, their mcap is $2.3B as of writing (so a revenue multiplier of 1.2x). This got me thinking, in a market where NVDA mcap trades at \~40x revenue, AMD trades at about \~14x revenue, TSLA trades at about \~25x revenue, and even INTC (which is widely considered lately to be a bit floppy when compared to their rivals) trades at 3x revenue - then this suggests that a few more good years and the market might be willing to let the price climb to a higher multiplier - all CRSR have to do is keep making money. LOGI who are probably their closest rival in the peripherals space trade at about 3x.

It's a similar story when you look at P/E ratios. LOGI/CRSR/INTC are sat around the 10-15 mark, but many other tech and PC orientated stocks are trading on ratios *way* higher than this.

Not only this, but this stock is being held about 33% short - which is significant in comparison to the other stocks mentioned above (who are all less than 10%). That's probably because CRSR is a relative newcomer to the market more than anything, but it could also just be because the hedge fund managers don't understand that it's a really well established brand in the markets it plays in.

With DDR5 on the horizon, sales in components still probably being depressed as the GPU availability and price situation hasn't yet calmed down (so many of their customers are poised to buy a new system, but haven't yet committed to it), and with the ever increasing popularity of gaming and streaming, I can't see that they are going to lose customers/revenue - and if anything as the GPU situation sorts itself out and with DDR5 becoming the latest RAM standard, I can only see sales in m.2 drives and RAM increasing. Further to this they are entering the monitors arena with a strong ""gamer"" brand that can command good prices/margin.

So immediate short term (heading to FY results) this stock could potentially multi-bag. On revenue multipliers alone, I feel this should be at about the $60 mark. Especially if the GPU situation gets much better towards Christmas.

Full disclosure, I have a small holding. I just really like this stock.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql5xlt/corsair_crsr_good_fundamentals_good_9_month/

There's almost no TA in this post, just telling you why I'm extremely bullish. I do have a position.

I'm an avid outdoorsman myself and go camping about every other week. Ever since COVID started campgrounds have been over run, especially in state parks. Most of the time these parks open their bookings 365 days + 1 week in advance. For the past two years I have had to stay up until midnight to be one of the first callers to get the spot(s) I want, and you better believe if you are even a couple hours late you will not get them. The amount of people who have gotten into the recreational camping world is astronomical, and I don't see it slowing down anytime soon. Couple that with the fact that $CWH not only has a hold on the

Camping World ($CWH) is Americas largest retailer of RVs and related products and services. In August they reported quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share, beating the Zack's Consensus Estimate of $2.22 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.62 per share a year ago. A quarter ago, it was expected that this recreational vehicle retailer and services provider would post earnings of $0.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.40, delivering a surprise of 159.26%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. I see them absolutely crushing earnings yet again when they report them tomorrow pre-market

The stock has run \~45% since Oct 4th on essentially no news (except for new patent approval). Big money is positioning itself for the results, which will likely drive the share price $15-$20 (as much as 50%) in one direction or another, given the [options interest on 11/19](https://maximum-pain.com/options/Cmps) (**with IV in the 190s-200%+**). 

This is the company that people *thought* MindMed was back in the spring. They have the moat, the product, the first-mover advantage, the money, and the people. Volume from this news is gonna be crazy and will catapult the sp. If you don't have anecdotal belief in psilocybin, and you don't trust the data (below), this is not for you. Or, alternatively, puts. Good luck.

The DD below (posted originally 6mo ago) holds up.

My position: 915 shares at $36.11 cost basis. Happy hunting.

\------------------------------------

**Background**

Company: Compass Pathways

Ticker: $CMPS

Market Cap (**11/01/2021**): $1.80b

Current Share Price (**11/01/2021**): $43.06

ATH Share Price (12/23/20): $59.20

About (in my own words): Mental healthcare drug co. w/ patented, synthetic form of psilocybin (active ingredient in magic mushrooms) called COMP360. Their drug is currently in Phase IIb FDA Trials, with results expected to report late 2021.

**The Background That Matters**

1. **Leadership and Investors:** $CMPS was an early public mover in the psychedelics space in the US. Pre-IPO they linked up with Christian Angermayer, whose 29% pre-IPO investment now represents 22% of the companys shares, last I heard. He brought his friend Peter Thiel in on the party. Anyway, Angermayer is the owner of Atai Life Sciences, which I can write about here because they havent yet IPOd. This relationship w/ Atai is important for two reasons: 1) Atai functions as an accelerator/incubator/parent co. for their umbrella of companies who are all seeking to address mental health concerns w/ psychedelics and psychedelic-adjacent drugs, which gives $CMPS access to huge resources (human, IP, and tech), and 2) Atai is going to go public soon, which will bring $$$ to the space. $CMPS cash position and access to capital is super-solid because of all info above.
2. **Patents:** $CMPS developed a synthetic form of psilocybin, COMP360. This drug was given Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in 2018, which is as good and as rare as it sounds like it should be. Essentially they have the blessing and the support of the FDA, which is really fucking good if you want to bring a drug to market. They now *also* have three patents for COMP360 for the treatment of Treatment-Resistant Depression (depression that has withstood 2+ attempts at treatment by conventional drugs) and Major Depressive Disorder aka MDD, which is much larger and more pernicious meaning that if their trials are successful, they have \~10 years of exclusive right to treat these conditions with their drugs.
3. **Psychedelics work:** There is enough study and anecdotal evidence to support the efficacy of psilocybin as a treatment for TRD and MDD. A WSB compilation of evidence can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li9jtm/shroom_stocks_are_they_really_the_next_big_thing/). If you dont believe that psilocybin works as a treatment, the DoD, your friends, and most well-read psychologists will disagree. But do your own research. Its a lynchpin of this play.

**The Bear Argument(s)**

This is what I love most about this play: If you take the long position on $CMPS, you are betting against boomers (ironically, youre doing it by betting *on* boomers (mushrooms (psilocybin))).

**1)** **Magic Mushrooms are Illegal!** Yeah, no shit, buddy. But this play depends essentially not at all upon the federal legality of psilocybin or its synthetic alternatives. $CMPS is working to get drug approval through the FDA, not the DEA. If you want to tell me that the DEA in 2023 is going to kick in the doors of pharmacies and doctors offices to seize synthetic psilocybin that was approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of mental health disorders  well, great. I can and will take that bet.

**2)** **The FDA May Not Approve.** True. But color me skeptical. The FDA has a history of approving some fairly novel drugs if they are shown to be effective, including J&amp;Js ketamine nasal spray for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression in 2019. If the FDA were going to take a Puritanistic stance on psychedelics, they wouldve done it before offering Breakthrough Therapy Designation to COMP360.

**3)** **Psychiatric drugs only make it to market 16% of the time.** An old, thorough, completely-wrong SeekingAlpha valuation of $CMPS used an industry-average 16% approval rate (the average success / make-it-to-market rate for psychiatric drugs in Phase IIb drug trials) to value $CMPS. This dude (on SA... ""Compass Pathways: rNPV Probabilities of Success are Underestimated"") correctly eviscerates the shmucks argument by pointing out that psilocybin has a massive, jaw-dropping dataset behind it, making its likelihood of success much, much higher than 16%... he just fucks up by suggesting $CMPS as only 4% of your portfolio.

**4)** **Their trial dose of 25mg will be incorrect.** Doubtful. All signs point to this being the optimal dose, as indicated by the NEJM study with results released tomorrow 4/14 (doses at 20mg and 30mg over six weeks) + older studies at Hopkins. Will it be perfect? No. But itll probably work for nearly everyone. EDIT: Yup.

**5)** **Interest rates increase and cash burn happens and single-drug pipeline and etc. and it just wont work.** Psych companies are going public, and theyre doing so with support from huge players. If interest rates go up, if inflation sets in  sure, the cash on-hand becomes less valuable. So they get more cash. Smart health sciences investors know this sector is the move. They are making the money available. $CMPS has years of runway on-hand. **Yes,** **they have only one drug in their pipeline, but if the drug works -- and it does -- then who gives a shit?**

**6)** **$CMPS is unethical.** $CMPS has come under fire recently for acting like pharma assholes. Theyre trying to file patents for everything from soft chairs to paint colors. Thats why theyre unpopular over on subs dedicated to investing in psychedelic stocks, and why theyre taking heat in the still-small psychedelic circles. But to be honest, I could give a fuck. Their drug is going to work, and its going to go to market, and its going to help people, and if they have protections around it, well, all the better for my investment.

**7)** **Mushrooms arent medicine theyre drugs you fuckin kids!** Fuck you, dude. Read the data.

**The Bull Argument**

Psilocybin works. Existing depression drugs do not.

The mental health crisis is just that  a [crisis](https://www.mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america)  and it is growing at a scary rate, bolstered largely by depressed kids under age 18. We have two generations of combat veterans grappling with PTSD and a DoD that is supportive of alternative treatments. When these companies catch the public eye, money will flood into this space, and it will go largely to the biggest fish in the pond.

Short story, Black Rifle Company is IPOing! Theyre the conservatives version of coffee. Do I like the company, no opinion, but starbux may have to battle with a conservative type of coffee chain now with a huge following.

There was the time Starbucks didnt include explicitly Christian messaging on their holiday cups, and were lumped in with the secularists who are waging war on Christmas. There was the Race Together campaign, in which the brand launched and then scrapped an initiative to have baristas talk to customers about race. There was the time last year when a bunch of men told baristas to write Trump on their cups after a white guy claimed he was racially discriminated against at a Starbucks. And then theres the fact that Starbucks founder Howard Schulz endorsed Hillary Clinton (and was floated as her possible Secretary of Labor).

The latest iteration of this trend came when Schulz announced that the company intends to hire 10,000 refugees over the next several years. Schulzs statement came after Trumps initial refugee ban, so conservatives viewed it as a direct attack. Starbucks should focus on America first and give jobs to military veterans, these people said, even though Starbucks has long had a program to do just that. Sketchy conservative sites ran with the story and said Starbucks was suffering because of it, even though theres no solid evidence of any PR-related decline.


So the company is a PR nightmare and now may have this new company start trimming their profits

1,"11/02/2021, 21:38:24",Gaining Visibility on Paysafe (PSFE) Parts 2-4,greensymbiote,"Here are Parts 2 - 4 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) covers Paysafes outlook on growth, and an expected miss for Q3ER.  I recommend starting with the [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) in Part 1, and following the links if still interested.

# 2. Debt

Paysafes recent acquisitions have spawned several misleading claims using faulty numbers to generate doubt about the companys ability to manage debt.For example:

* One article tried to make a specific case that Paysafe cant cover debt due to Q2s 46% free cash flow conversion rate. The author's acrobatic bias ignores the obvious fact that the Q2 balance sheet clearly states a year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate of 70%, not 46%. The CFO noted that Q2s conversion rate was temporarily affected by a one-time tax payment that is to be partially refunded. (Notably, Q1s free cash flow conversion rate was 96%. At $108 million, it was a 28% YoY increase.)
* Another article cries liquidity problems, citing, Paysafe Ltds earnings cannot cover its interest expense. If the situation continues, the company may have to issue more debt. By relying on websites that blindly auto-calculate debt service ratios, the article doesn't account for recent debt restructuring and dramatically misrepresents forward expenses by ignoring:

1. $84 million in one-time merger related expenses will not be repeated,
2. over $40 million in one-time debt restructuring fees will not be repeated,
3. newly reduced interest expenses resulting in roughly [$70 million](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) in annualized savings.

* A third article mistakenly claims Paysafe, will add another $1 billion in net debt to close the Latin America deals.  In truth, the two deals mentioned total $550 million (SafetyPay at [$441m](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005095/en/Paysafe-to-Acquire-SafetyPay/) and Pago Efectivo at [$108.5m](https://www.alantra.com/ib-transaction/grupo-el-comercio-sell-side-advisory-pagoefectivo-paysafe/)). A third European acquisition, viafintech, is [reported](https://finanz-szene.de/payments/der-2-exit-von-barzahlen-doch-was-ist-seit-dem-1-exit-passiert/) to be valued at $42.5 million euros ($49 million USD). While the three deals total roughly $598 million, much of that can be covered between Paysafes $247.8 million in cash, their $270 million in undrawn revolving credit and their $360-$430 million in free cash flow. Total added debt will likely be less than half of what the article assumes. (In fairness, the author later admitted he read the transcript wrong.)

After paying down $1.2 billion in debt in Q1, Paysafe used its two notch credit rating upgrade from [Moodys](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Paysafe-to-B1-stable-outlook--PR_443474) and [S&amp;P](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) to reorganize remaining debt, extend maturity and significantly lower average interest rates, reducing interest expenses by $70 million. The result, inclusive of new debt from acquisitions: credit upgrades were reaffirmed along with a $305 million revolving credit facility and the company will save around $43 million in annualized interest expense.This means forward debt-related costs are on track to drop by more than half, from an estimated $165 million in 2021 to less than $80 million in 2022. Combined with $84 million in other non-recurring merger-related expenses, thats over $160 million in cost reductions going forward.Strong free cash flow and over $160 million in reduced costs can go a long way to quickly paying down debt. Add in the expected acquisition growth synergies and the companys quoted path to a 35% EBITDA margin, and the picture looks even better.  Management noted, the deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.  The very realistic potential of 17-18% revenue growth could attain that target ratio in short order.All this points to sustainable deleveraging, paving the way for more growth through M&amp;A. (It also doesnt hurt that the company stands to take in more than half a billion cash from outstanding warrants, which will directly benefit enterprise value and inorganic growth potential.)Carrying large debt is extremely common in the Fintech sector and Paysafe is by no means an outlier here. (Square, Repay, Fiserv, Shift4, Affirm, Bill and Paysign all have worse debt/EBITDA ratios and most of them still have negative earnings). In itself, debt leverage is not a bad thing, particularly if its manageable and generates more growth. That definitely appears to be the case here.

# 3. Profit

When considering how Paysafe is setting itself up for future profit potential, here are some points worth underscoring:

* Without $92 million in non-recurring costs, Q1 would have been very profitable, beating analysts consensus by as much +0.10 EPS.
* Despite Q2s $40 million in non-repeating costs, Paysafe still managed to beat on earnings with its first profitable quarter as a newly public company.
* Roughly $167 million in H1 expenses will not repeat going forward:

1. $84m one-time share based compensation,
2. $40m one-time accelerated capitalized debt fees,
3. $43m estimated reduction in annual interest expenses

* Those reductions alone represent a potential +0.22 EPS, which exceeds analysts projections.  (Some platforms have reported analysts estimate 3-400% profit growth for 2022 with an average of 75% annual profit growth thereafter.  Fortunately, on Q3 guidance, analysts have been revising their forward estimates downwards which ultimately better positions PSFE to beat consensus down the road. This contrasts with analysts initial EPS estimates which did not appear to fully account for the one-time merger and debt restructuring costs.)
* Paysafes margins are also expected to expand as they work through deliberate measures to de-risk future growth.  For example, their integrated processing take rate has been compressed by strategic Direct Marketing exits in anticipation of new compliance rules. This is expected to abate by end of year.  Management notes: we do expect EBITDA margins to expand in the back-half of the year and to continue that like a steady drumbeat going into next year as well reflecting continued strength in integrated processing, including the on-boarding of several new e-commerce clients in late Q3 and early Q4, stronger growth in digital wallet as well as sequential improvement in direct marketing.
* Between Q3 and FY guidance, there is an implied guidance for a Q4 EBITDA of $153 million.  That represents a YoY EBITDA growth of 60.5%, which may offer a signal as to how moving beyond legacy de-risking headwinds can start to improve the margin picture going forward.
* Their fastest growing segment, eCash, has a high take rate of 7.2%.  For H1/21, they reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth which would reasonably point to a future business mix with higher overall margins.  Further growth in this segment stands to benefit from their new LATAM expansion, their new Glory Ltd partnership, as well as their recently launched US [campaign](https://www.skrill.com/es-us/enviar-transferir-dinero-mexico/?utm_source=tv&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=DIEGOSMT) to engage the US/Mexico remittance market (worth [$40 billion](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-migrants-home-record-40-billion-2020-75642052) annually). Also, their [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) deal expands eCash in 22 countries and their recent deals with [ZEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-extends-partnership-zen-com-080000606.html), [REPAY](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), and [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/) further expands their eCash network across the US and in 25 European countries.
* With a gross margin of 61-63%, upon execution of their two year strategy to unlock over $100m organic adj. EBITDA ([page 28](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)), management cites a potential pro forma upside that could drive EBITDA CAGR to 21%.
* One aspect of this margin expansion strategy is in the companys ongoing integration of their various business segments into a single code on a cloud-based gateway, the Unity Platform. This streamlining will enable them to reduce costs and scale up quickly in new markets and in emerging verticals like travel, [trading in the wallet](https://coinquora.com/paysafes-neteller-adds-fiat-to-crypto-feature-on-its-platform/), digital goods, online gaming, and banking as a service.  Among the benefits of this new synthesis:

1. it increases operating margins through cost-saving efficiencies and eliminating redundancies (automating underwriting, 2/3 reduction in data centers)
2. it enables them to forward unsolicited cost savings to partners, merchants and users, helping them retain and gain new marketshare,
3. it eliminates on-boarding each service separately by making their entire suite automatically available through a single gateway, which builds in substantial cross-selling opportunities

# 4. Float

The number of institutional funds owning PSFE has grown from 187 to 297 over the last quarter. At this point, nearly all the major funds hold shares at a cost basis much higher than the current price. These include Wells Fargo, Blackrock, Citigroup, State Street, JP Morgan, Francisco Partners, Naya Capital and noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point), David Tepper (Appaloosa), Aaron Cohen (Survetta), Seth Rosen (Nitorum) and Leon Cooperman, (who personally owns over a million shares). Notably, most of these investors bought shares before Paysafes [recent history](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/) of value creation.  Cross-referencing the most up to date [record](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) with older filings, some [estimate](https://solarpvinvestor.com/topic/3255-paysafe-holdings-psfe/?tab=comments#comment-103030) the true available float is between 70-80 million shares. For what has historically been a low beta stock, theoretically, a reduced free float influences the proportionate affect of true short interest and could cause the stock price to move faster.

There has been a noticeable amount of INTC posts but non of these delve into their technical shortfalls compared to their competitors AMD NVDA TSM ARM etc

I wrote this many years ago https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

and the gap in technology is even bigger in AMD's favor.  Since 2016 I've been super bullish on AMD at $1.80, cloud computing stocks MSFT AMZN, energy stocks like TSLA etc. 

If you've ever been in a datacenter it consumes a ton of energy and why I think the future of computing is AMD NVDA TSM ARM MSFT AMZN  and energy efficiency stocks.  

INTC lacks this and is falling way behind in tech and design, still far behind and I literally called it years ago almost on the dot.   

Other users have noticed this too

https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qkihov/intc_cluster_buy_by_510_directors_and_ceo/hiwxuit/

My post pointing out that since 2016 AMD NVDA TSM have been superior in design efficiency and stock price was promptly deleted on that sub.  I reminded them that since 2016 AMD price has increased close to 6800%, NVDA 3400%, TSM 500%, cloud computing has taken off and MSFT is up 600% AMZN 500%.

Intel is gone up maybe 30% in the biggest stock run and semiconductor/cloud computing run.

So be weary of INTC suggestions.  Not saying you can't make money it is up 30% in 5-6 years but there are way better investments and the opportunity costs of missing out better tech like AMD NVDA TSM MSFT AMZN etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql3vzm/be_careful_of_the_all_the_sudden_intc_suggestions/

Biden Unveils Multipronged Assault on Planet-Warming Methane  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/biden-unveils-multipronged-assault-on-climate-warming-methane

So it is now official:

1) Methane is public enemy number 1 (old news - that was clear already based on how much methane was destined to be a big part of the official and unofficial COP26 agenda discussed in recent weeks)

2) New - Federal government is launching initiatives accross government and the globe to keep the potent heat trapping gas from escaping landfills oil wells and farms. Source Bloomberg. 

3) specifically Dept of Agriculture is announcing a program to encourage farmers to harness and sell methane. 

So who stands to benefit from all of this? More methane = more RNG. Which means more incentive for AMZN and other trucking fleet operators to buy RNG vehicles and commit to RNG as an alternative fuel source (alongside EV). Which means more RNG being bought at RNG refuelling stations. Which means more revenue for operators like CLNE who represent an integrated RNG infrastructure play.

I'm pretty new to trading in genereal, so maybe there's already a common term for this or it doesn't work. Basically if you would buy and sell futures at the same time (for 100$ each) with a high leverage (lets say x100). If the market goes up by 1.5% your short would get liquidated at 1% (you loose your 100$) and your long would have made gains of 150% (now 250$). Which would leave you with 25% profit of your original investment.

1,"11/02/2021, 17:52:26",I have an AMA for Wednesday that I need approval for. Ill be spending an hour with the $LCID,TheModeratorWrangler,"Ill be filming the entire vehicle and features for understanding the differences in things like fit and finish, interior, backseat reclining seats, experience of being a passenger, etc. Ive been experienced with Lucid from 2015 when they had their debut at the NYIAS and got to see the car on press days (so many features disabled for public worked since then). 

The thing about TA and charts is that people here will ironically apply TA to Tesla. In a world that climate change is a real thing and people are starting to understand EVs in a broader sense (electric scooter for work, electric Tesla for fun), I feel its important to take a step back from Tesla and realize the importance of not just competition, but competitors who can bring results to the table. I salute Musk for what hes done for EV tech but the biggest trick the devil ever played was sitting on your laurels while others learn from your mistakes.

Ever since Elon made all his patents free, big auto is using Tesla to catch up. You think Lucid and / or Rivian happened overnight? 

Im long Lucid, but also in FDs. I want one. The fit and finish from 2015 surpassed the top of the line Model S.

1,"11/02/2021, 17:33:12",Tesla is spearheading the paradigm shift to EV - $3k in 2022,droneauto,"Theres a paradigm shift from ICE cars to electric Cars. The big US automakers, GM, Ford, Chrysler, have over 500,000 employees of which 90%+ have ICE experience and ZERO electric car experience. Their legacy can be their demise trying to compete with Teslas 70,000 employees of which 100% only works with/on electric cars. These employees are building and operating robotics manufacturing plants, developing, and maintaining proprietary supercomputers, AI software, semiconductors etc just like any computer manufacturer but the Tesla PC has wheels. Tesla logs millions of miles every day analyzing the worlds roads and traffic situations and feeds this information into their AI systems to perfect Full Self Driving software. Tesla is millions of miles ahead of the competition and the competition not only has to do a 180 as far as manufacturing but also the entire mindset of every employee. Thats not done overnight. GM boldly states to be even with Tesla in 2025, Ill take the under!

Its the manufacturing stupid! Tesla uses thousands of less parts manufacturing cars with robotics which leads to less cost and higher output/time. My guess is some of the competition will fold, simply because of being to late to the party and not surviving the 5-10 years it would take them to start from scratch because thats what they must do (even if they dont think so and believe they can use existing staff and equipment and just retool a little).

Never mind Teslas cars being rated the safest, fastest and imho nicest cars on the road leading to an unlimited demand. They are smarter, being produced faster and cheaper.

Robotaxis will rely on AI software and learning the roads and traffic situations so that we can remove the steering wheel and just have a nice relaxing ride with no accidents (Tesla cars running FSD are 10 times safer that those with a manual driver).

Obviously, Teslas software, AI and manufacturing/robotics expertise can be used outside building just cars.

Dont forget powerpacks, solar roofs, Boring and SpaceX relationship that completes the future possibilities. Batteries will become cheaper and last longer and soon to be propulsion of boats and planes (unless the world accepts nuclear).

Whats Tesla worth when the competition fails while Tesla is speeding down the road with driver-less cars, 10s of millions of them earning money for every mile.

My estimation is that it will be worth $5T by 2030 and way before then they will have discovered many new income streams from a captured audience taking a ride  think Advertising and proprietary in-car entertainment offerings.

2022 Target: $3,000/share with Berlin and Austin ramping up to full speed just like Shanghai.

The existing short positions are understandable after the initial surge, however one glimps of good news, one post, could potentially send this stock sky high. Short positions need to be covered to realize the profit, buying back the stock at the lower prices if available. If the stock moves up, hands potentially can be forced resulting in a massive short squeeze.

Looking at the atmosphere surrounding the stock and the merger, we have to conclude that it is surpassing the mere financial company related interpretation to determine the stock price, it is having the characteristics of a potential meme stock, yet in this case we cant finish the story there , this is a first, first time a stock represents a clear political movement, for the United States the battle between republicans and Democrats , for the rest of the world the battle of privacy versus monopolistic positions of big tech.

We were recently were able to cash out $1 million in stock + retain a permanent ~800 share position...it has fundamentally changed our lives. You are betting against a company's STOCK (my emphasis added) that you fail to understand.

""It is too large of a market cap at $1.2T, it has to come down after all of this.""

Why is this wrong? You have a fundamental misunderstanding of the size of the float. The float is in the hands of the insane man hodler, holding roughly 25%, plus all the retail traders you've belittled over the past decade who are now living their best life...in other words, many others who don't intend on selling into the float so easily. Shorting into this is bad. Funds are also required to hold the stock...further reducing the float. You are letting the market cap make you think things that aren't true.

""The short interest is low"".

Why is this wrong? The short interest percentage on this stock is meaningless as Tesla currently has a $40 billion dollar short position bet against it. This happens to be the biggest bet against a company in the history of human civilization. This $40 billion bet is weighted even heavier due to the float situation described above.

""I'm shorting at the top"".

Says the guy who shorts today. The guy last week said the same thing. The dude in 2013 told me the same thing. You are creating a snowball of pain for yourselves that only ends when shorters run out of money...and there is a lot of money out there.

""This is the most inflated stock ever"".

I heard the same in 2012. 2013. 2014. 2015. 2016. 2017. 2018. 2019. 2020. 2021. And want to know what changed? You are now -confirmed- betting against one of the smartest people to ever walk the face of the planet. Want to know what didn't change? You guys keep throwing bad money after bad money, even though you can see the field full of those who came before you, valiantly fighting that valuation...

Keep doing what you want if shorting Tesla is all you can come up with for great ideas...I don't mind watching the accounts increase $80,000 in 1 day (see previous post for proof of TSLA stake) but if you insist on me having your money, I will happily take it.

For any shorters wanting updates on what I've been doing with your money, I bought a brand new laptop this week. Thank you :)

For the record, I never thought you shorters would take things this far...you've exceeded my wildest dreams.

The happiest shareholders alive

Yes I know Hertz has been booking cars, and yes I know the credit score just got higher, which is a big thing to consider for big money in Wall Street. But none of this can justify a 40% increase in such short period of time for a company as big as Tesla.

Just FYI Im a shareholder of TSLA too and 50% of my portfolio is in Tesla. But still I think this is pure madness. I dont know what your price targets are, but speaking from an extreme long term investor, I just wish the growth of Tesla can be slower and quieter. I dont like the noises around Tesla these days.

Tesla is now a 1T company and the entire us stock market is 50T. So I just have an honest question: where do you see Tesla in 5 years? Or perhaps by the year 2025? Do you really see it becoming a 10 T company which (assuming total market cap became 100T due to inflation and various other reasons) consists of 10% of the entire market?

Being involved a tiny bit in real estate, I often do real estate related research.  And yes, that means browsing subreddits related to real estate investing.

There is one MAJOR theme that has been happening over the last couple months and that is Zillow swooping in and offering sellers prices WAYYY over asking to buy there homes.  The pitch is pretty rock solid ""We are Zillow, we want to buy your house for 20% over list price and we can close in less than 2 weeks!""  Sellers are like ""We'll I'm dumb but I'm not THAT dumb, SOLD!"".

Then the sellers get on Reddit and write up a post that goes like ""Blah blah blah, Zillow bought my house for 20% over list price!  I don't see how they expect to make a profit but I couldn't say no!  It was so easy, I can't wait to move into my next huge liability..."" OK but yeah - the theme is everyone is left wondering how in the world Zillow is gonna make money flipping all these homes they are paying over market for.  Which I too wondered until.....

Fast forward to today - turns out the answer to ""How is Zillow  gonna make money doing this"" is that they are NOT making money doing this.  They let their little AI (artificial intelligence - think like if your brain was a computer) program set the prices they should buy homes at, and that's basically what they did.  Turns out they had someone put a comma in the wrong place or something in the program because over 90% of the homes they have since relisted are listed far below what they paid for them.

As much as I admire their commitment to our buy high sell low way of life - I suspect it's not a great long term plan, in fact it's a bad short term plan too.  

I know nothing means anything in this market anymore - but to me there is a significant chance their earnings (tomorrow at 5pm) are not gonna be too hot.  

This is a complete beta post since I have almost no liquidity to put my money where my mouth is (see earlier in this post the part about buying a house).  But I do have a few hundred left in my Peter Pan (Robinhood) account - and if I can swing it I'm gonna put that towards at least one put option tomorrow.

Most of the mills in the US are now only equipped with Electric Arc Furnaces, These ONLY take SCRAP STEEL, which they melt down. There are a multitude of Reasons why many have went from BOF to EAF mills, but for us what is important is the following. (NOTE: BOF- Basic Oxygen Furnace. Actually melting all minerals and produce from scratch.)  BOFs are huge, expensive, time consuming and 'old school'

NOTE:  If you have never seen an EAF operate then click the following link and enjoy. No nothing in the video is going wrong, that is how its suppose to run..... insane.....

[EAF FURNACE @ 80 MW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j2jESz7Zl8&amp;ab_channel=%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%90%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%B8)  


Currently there is a nationwide CONCERN growing in scrap haulers, steel salesman (me) but most of all, in the EAF mills. These concerns are about nationwide scrap supply. Like serious concerns. In fact steel prices have taken a very aggressive dip within the last 3 weeks and right now there is talk of scrap costs going up. (Seems impossible, but it suggests the mills are nervous about supply moving forward.  


SOOO why is this important? Well what happens if for some reason the EAF mills cannot get scrap they have ONE alternative. They must use what the industry calls iron pellets. And how do you make those in large volume, large enough to sustain an entire mill?  


With an 'old school' BOF mill.........

  
CLF (gonclaves) has been buying A LOT of the old BOFs in this country. People have laughed at him for it since they arent cutting edge anymore. Perhaps he sees something. And I believe he does.  


CLF could be in a position at one point where they are suppling their competitors pellets because their competitors cant fill their own orders.  

Nucor uses an EAF mill.  They also have DRI plants which make these pellets.  However most EAF mills do NOT have that capability.  And even with Nucor they cannot make enough to run all of their operations.  ALSO, MORE EAFs are currently being built, in my opinion flooding the market.... there is another selective pressure on scrap supply/cost.

So my prediction is that scrap will get tight, maybe even experience the dreaded 'shortage' and the only way for them to melt more steel is buy the pellets from a BOF mill.

And who owns most of the BOF mills in the country?  Cleveland Cliffs.....

My god is this a long play but the upside potential..

NO i did not look at charts, or do analysis, nor did i look at trends. (Trends are fucking retarded right now, there are no trends.... we in the steel industry are in total uncharted waters.)  Why uncharted? 

This is the highest steel costs have ever been.  And not the highest in the country's history.... the highest they have been in the entire history of the steel industry from the day it was created.... 

&amp;#x200B;

So my predication comes from 12 years buying and selling nonprime, working in a processing facility, tracking pricing and steel 'futures' while also analyzing the chemistry of certain items AND bidding on material on a weekly basis. 

Charts are great and all, but a chart/technicals cannot hold my jockstrap.  Cant beat the info you get actually being on the battlefield.

From one of the ongoing class-action lawsuits against Robinhood.

I mean, they weren't expected to owe a fiduciary duty, but having it written in black and white as an argument justifying their actions is a bit off-putting. Especially for using the 'Robinhood' brand. But, someone here can probably add more context for or against.

8,"11/02/2021, 07:35:30","I'm a professional solar developer, and I'm super bullish on ARRY",No-Significance-4924,"I have never posted in here, but I feel compelled to share why I think Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is positioned to surge in the next few weeks and continue climbing for years. Quick credentials: I am a Director at a nationwide developer of large-scale, ground-mounted solar projects. 

In simple terms, ARRY makes single-axis trackers. Solar panels sit on top of the single-axis trackers, which rotate from east to west as the sun rises and sets, maximizing energy production. This style of racking has become the industry standard in recent years, and ARRY is the best one, in my opinion. With a single motor and a single center driveshaft, their technology can rotate thousands of solar panels. They are a market leader, based in the US, and the largest factor in their input cost is steel. 

There are 3 reasons why Im bullish:

1. The massive reconciliation bill currently in front of congress could pass any day now. It would dramatically increase and **extend the solar investment tax credit and feature a domestic content requirement**, which requires a percentage of the capital investment to go toward US made or assembled products.  A rising tide lifts all ships, plus ARRY is uniquely positioned to satisfy the domestic content requirement.

2. ARRYs Q3 earnings report is expected on **November 4**. Theres been an unprecedented steel shortage that has wreaked havoc on ARRY and other companies heavily reliant on steel. My guess is the earnings report will be not amazing but decent. And a decent earnings report would indicate light at the end of the tunnel regarding the steel shortage  this is the primary thing holding this stock back over the last 6 months.

3. As the price of steel comes back down to Earth, ARRY may maintain its current pricing, which means they could have a **significantly higher profit margin than they did pre-steel-shortage**. 

Disclaimers: Most of my companys solar projects use ARRYs solar racking equipment. I am not a financial advisor, and this opinion is the product of public information and my own professional experience.

* Stocks reached a new high as strong corporate earnings overshadowed disappointing manufacturing data.
* Treasuries dropped.
* The S&amp;P 500 recovered from earlier losses, with gains led by energy and consumer discretionary companies. For the first time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 36,000 mark. A small-cap index rose 2.7%. A group of retail-trader favorites, including Gamestop and AMC Entertainment holdings had their best day since August.
* More than 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting third-quarter results outperformed Wall Street expectations. Since the start of the earnings season, this has laid the groundwork for a stock market rally.
* Meanwhile, data showed that manufacturers faced persistent supply-chain challenges in October. Fed officials will meet this week as investors worry that the economy is facing the most widespread supply crunch since the 1973 oil crisis.
* According to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, the bullish trend in equities may continue into the Thanksgiving holiday later this month, but ""not for much longer,"" as the Fed is expected to begin tapering and earnings growth will slow further into next year.

The stock has run \~45% since Oct 4th on essentially no news (except for new patent approval). Big money is positioning itself for the results, which will likely drive the share price $15-$20 (as much as 50%) in one direction or another, given the [options interest on 11/19](https://maximum-pain.com/options/Cmps)

(with IV in the 190s-200+).

This is the company that people *thought* MindMed was back in the spring. They have the moat, the product, the first-mover advantage, the money, and the people. Volume from this news is gonna be crazy and will catapult the sp. If you don't have anecdotal belief in psilocybin, and you don't trust the data (below), this is not for you. Or, alternatively, puts. Good luck.

The DD below (posted originally 6mo ago) holds up.

My position: 915 shares at $36.11 cost basis. Happy hunting.

\------------------------------------

**Background**

Company: Compass Pathways

Ticker: $CMPS

Market Cap (**11/01/2021**): $1.80b

Current Share Price (**11/01/2021**): $43.06

ATH Share Price (12/23/20): $59.20

About (in my own words): Mental healthcare drug co. w/ patented, synthetic form of psilocybin (active ingredient in magic mushrooms) called COMP360. Their drug is currently in Phase IIb FDA Trials, with results expected to report late 2021.

**The Background That Matters**

1. **Leadership and Investors:** $CMPS was an early public mover in the psychedelics space in the US. Pre-IPO they linked up with Christian Angermayer, whose 29% pre-IPO investment now represents 22% of the companys shares, last I heard. He brought his friend Peter Thiel in on the party. Anyway, Angermayer is the owner of Atai Life Sciences, which I can write about here because they havent yet IPOd. This relationship w/ Atai is important for two reasons: 1) Atai functions as an accelerator/incubator/parent co. for their umbrella of companies who are all seeking to address mental health concerns w/ psychedelics and psychedelic-adjacent drugs, which gives $CMPS access to huge resources (human, IP, and tech), and 2) Atai is going to go public soon, which will bring $$$ to the space. $CMPS cash position and access to capital is super-solid because of all info above.
2. **Patents:** $CMPS developed a synthetic form of psilocybin, COMP360. This drug was given Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in 2018, which is as good and as rare as it sounds like it should be. Essentially they have the blessing and the support of the FDA, which is really fucking good if you want to bring a drug to market. They now *also* have three patents for COMP360 for the treatment of Treatment-Resistant Depression (depression that has withstood 2+ attempts at treatment by conventional drugs) and Major Depressive Disorder aka MDD, which is much larger and more pernicious meaning that if their trials are successful, they have \~10 years of exclusive right to treat these conditions with their drugs.
3. **Psychedelics work:** There is enough study and anecdotal evidence to support the efficacy of psilocybin as a treatment for TRD and MDD. A WSB compilation of evidence can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li9jtm/shroom_stocks_are_they_really_the_next_big_thing/). If you dont believe that psilocybin works as a treatment, the DoD, your friends, and most well-read psychologists will disagree. But do your own research. Its a lynchpin of this play.

**The Bear Argument(s)**

This is what I love most about this play: If you take the long position on $CMPS, you are betting against boomers (ironically, youre doing it by betting *on* boomers (mushrooms (psilocybin))).

**1)** **Magic Mushrooms are Illegal!** Yeah, no shit, buddy. But this play depends essentially not at all upon the federal legality of psilocybin or its synthetic alternatives. $CMPS is working to get drug approval through the FDA, not the DEA. If you want to tell me that the DEA in 2023 is going to kick in the doors of pharmacies and doctors offices to seize synthetic psilocybin that was approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of mental health disorders  well, great. I can and will take that bet.

**2)** **The FDA May Not Approve.** True. But color me skeptical. The FDA has a history of approving some fairly novel drugs if they are shown to be effective, including J&amp;Js ketamine nasal spray for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression in 2019. If the FDA were going to take a Puritanistic stance on psychedelics, they wouldve done it before offering Breakthrough Therapy Designation to COMP360.

**3)** **Psychiatric drugs only make it to market 16% of the time.** An old, thorough, completely-wrong SeekingAlpha valuation of $CMPS used an industry-average 16% approval rate (the average success / make-it-to-market rate for psychiatric drugs in Phase IIb drug trials) to value $CMPS. This dude (on SA... ""Compass Pathways: rNPV Probabilities of Success are Underestimated"") correctly eviscerates the shmucks argument by pointing out that psilocybin has a massive, jaw-dropping dataset behind it, making its likelihood of success much, much higher than 16%... he just fucks up by suggesting $CMPS as only 4% of your portfolio.

**4)** **Their trial dose of 25mg will be incorrect.** Doubtful. All signs point to this being the optimal dose, as indicated by the NEJM study with results released tomorrow 4/14 (doses at 20mg and 30mg over six weeks) + older studies at Hopkins. Will it be perfect? No. But itll probably work for nearly everyone. EDIT: Yup.

**5)** **Interest rates increase and cash burn happens and single-drug pipeline and etc. and it just wont work.** Psych companies are going public, and theyre doing so with support from huge players. If interest rates go up, if inflation sets in  sure, the cash on-hand becomes less valuable. So they get more cash. Smart health sciences investors know this sector is the move. They are making the money available. $CMPS has years of runway on-hand. **Yes,** **they have only one drug in their pipeline, but if the drug works -- and it does -- then who gives a shit?**

**6)** **$CMPS is unethical.** $CMPS has come under fire recently for acting like pharma assholes. Theyre trying to file patents for everything from soft chairs to paint colors. Thats why theyre unpopular over on subs dedicated to investing in psychedelic stocks, and why theyre taking heat in the still-small psychedelic circles. But to be honest, I could give a fuck. Their drug is going to work, and its going to go to market, and its going to help people, and if they have protections around it, well, all the better for my investment.

**7)** **Mushrooms arent medicine theyre drugs you fuckin kids!** Fuck you, dude. Read the data.

**The Bull Argument**

Psilocybin works. Existing depression drugs do not.

The mental health crisis is just that  a [crisis](https://www.mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america)

 and it is growing at a scary rate, bolstered largely by depressed kids under age 18. We have two generations of combat veterans grappling with PTSD and a DoD that is supportive of alternative treatments. When these companies catch the public eye, money will flood into this space, and it will go largely to the biggest fish in the pond.

*Many thanks to the folks who commented on the initial post and offered constructive criticism.*

**INTERPRETING THE CHART**

**Lower values** on the EV / (EH/s) metrics implies the company is *under-valued* and there is opportunity for it to increase in value. The more extreme the discrepancy, the greater potential for a price increase.

**For example, if a company is trading at 1/3 the Average EV / (EH/s) that would imply the possibility for a 3x increase in price**  assuming valuations became normalized on that metrics.

these projections are constantly changing, did my best to pull the latest figures from various summary sources, but there might be more recent stuff out there. if anything is inaccurate, feel free to send me a source pointing out the inaccuracy and I will update

 

**UNDERSTANDING MINER VALUATION**

Valuing miners on a relative basis comes down to 4 things:

(a) How much they can mine

(b) How expensive it costs them to mine

(c) Expected growth in mining capability

And lastly

(d) How much the company is currently valued at

Put succinctly, if you can find some that currently is and will be producing large amounts for RELATIVELY a relatively low cost for the company  then that is an opportunity for growth. Production capacity is measured by hash rate. In this case EH/s or Exahash per second. The primary determinant of cost is electricity. And the value of a company is enterprise value (not share price, not market cap).

So when we normalize on these by calculating EV / (EH/s)  this should pretty clearly flag the appealing stocks in this sector. The results speak for themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkmrgp/undervalued_miner_chart_updated_20211101_cifr_hut/

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/58ln5iz341x71.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0ed3cc87eea6d3ec79f3dbd283c4451ca94e810

Of most interest to us is Revenue and Sales and Marketing.

What is Revenue? It is GMV of all stuff they sold through the marketplace + ProductBoost (aka ads) + Logistics revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/om6s0wu741x71.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7a087ef4c770f0b8453334469698ba8cdfb7a58

Sales and marketing is mostly ads they buy, mostly on Facebook and is equal to $396M in Q2.

From what I see on the screenshot below, in July they've started to decrease ads spend and winded it down to \~400K installs per week.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kfcsd6f941x71.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b22bf940141d070a20ccebd3c44047c1f51af4

Compared to average 2.5M installs/week in Q2 it is almost 6 times less in S&amp;M expenses in Q3. So instead of $400M, S&amp;M in Q3 should be around $70-80M.

The key question here is whether the overall Revenue will fall accordingly, and I don't remember them sharing any cohorts statistics or any details that will help us understand this, but I believe it shouldn't fall significantly less than $400M, as with the decreased spend they stopped buying ROI-negative customers and only getting those who are willing to spend.

Taking this into account, I don't understand why RH shows estimated earnings per share at negative $0.14. If Cost of Revenue will stay at 30%-40% of Revenue and no other surprises will emerge, their bottom line should be positive.

**TL;DR -** RTY/IWM/RUT tracks most meme stocks

It's breaking out recently from a massive pattern which is probably a big reason everything is running now - and one of the reasons I've been analyzing all these stocks

An index breaking out is a great signal of a **rotation into the stocks within it**

We need a **weekly close above 2323** to confirm a breakout

RTY will target **2500+** as long as it holds onto the **teal trendline** in the picture and **small caps will see one of the largest rotations in quite some time**

Watch RTY/IWM/RUT closely to know when it's time to exit trending names

\---

We all know about the indexes right? Well - because of indexation - everything is linked nowadays. Stocks move together for the most part depending on their categories.

SPX is the S&amp;P 500 (growth/tech heavy but a bit less so than NDX), NDX is the Nasdaq 100 (growth/tech heavy), DJIA is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (lots of boomer stuff, value)

Well - there just so happens to be an index that **most meme stocks belong to -**

**RUT - the Russell 2000 Index**

I mean just look at the moves today:

There's a few different Russell indexes - but this is the one I track the most closely - because I trade a lot of futures and **RTY** is the contract.

Basically - it's a **small-cap** stock market index. What's a small cap?

* ""A small cap is generally a company with a marketcapitalizationof between $300 million and $2 billion.""

\- from Investopedia

Yeah that market capitalization is quite a bit smaller than most memes - but **before they 1000xed** on hype, they were somewhere around there.

Can you guess what stocks were top holdings in in it? GME, AMC to name a couple - as well as most of the stocks being shilled around here. **It might as well be the meme stock index.**

Now here's where it gets interesting - take a look at the chart. I track the indexes 24/7 from a technical standpoint - and I've been able to catch nearly every rotation for a while now by identifying which are breaking out, and which are consolidating. If an index is breaking out - we usually see money flow in there. The bigger the pattern - the bigger the rotation:

[$RTY 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/ir5d7f0kt0x71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=356503c2794868dbe8451674166e3988b421e126)

The gist is - **if IWM is breaking out, meme plays are going to have a much higher probability of success**. Keep a close eye on this chart when playing these names.

We need a weekly close above **2323** to seal the deal. This means Friday @ 5:00 P.M. needs to be over **2323.**

From there, RTY should be in the rotation for 3+ months, targeting **2500** mainly and possibly even **2600**.

During this time, small caps/meme stocks should stay in the rotation, and WSB might stop losing money. I have my doubts that they can all sustain an up move for that long though, so don't get too attached to any one name. Money will likely flow from stock to stock within the index. You could also play IWM directly.

**One last thing - J Pow Presser is on Wednesday. Depending what he says, a wrench could be thrown in this breakout. Remember we need the weekly close at least for something of this magnitude.**

Investors are saying things like ""GameStop is going to be the stock of 2022 and beyond. Facts: GameStop's Non-Fungible Digital Asset, Collectibles Marketplace, Web3.0 Gaming Metaverse, E-Commerce and Brick-and-Mortar Gaming monopoly, and a marketing analysis that shows that GameStop earned $1.5Trillion worth of free marketing in 2021."" I have not seen this free-marketing analysis, so if anyone has access to that, let me know.

Investors also seem to be viewing the laying off of Jenna Owens as a bullish sign, likely revealing a strong culture requirement of success with the executive C-suite.

For AMC, CEO Adom Aron is pushing to allow meme digital assets for use in their theaters.  With the coronavirus pandemic showing signs of slowing, and theater revenue growing 542% (versus the previous quarter last year), data is showing that audiences are flocking back to see new movies.  Notable releases were James Bond (No Time to Die), Dune, Marvel's Eternals (this weekend), and the new Thor and additional Marvel Cinematic Universe releases on the list.  Personally, I would like to see the new Top Gun: Maverick in theaters, because my TV setup at home does not do its justice, and especially since I have to keep the volume down at home.

***Technicals:***

GameStop just jumped above $200 for the first time in weeks. Let's look at some of the other information.

Before we begin I want to note that the individuals I mention are all public figures, and the only information I am providing is that which is publicly available. 

Our story begins in a time not so far in the past where the coronavirus was just making it's around the world, the price of oil was tanking, and we were trapped in our homes... or in the case of some of us long on the market, trapped in cardboard boxes behind the nearest Wendy's. 

In early 2020, a man who will not be named, but founded this sub, had just come back from a long hiatus from renting motor vehicles to the city of Tijuna and making millions. Thanks in part to nepotism and lack of moral fiber, he had kept this job until an administration change. When things began to get rough for him, and the contracts dried up, he saw the opportunity that was WallStreetBets, and took it. 

This individual went on to write a book about us, a book that contains information he wasn't here to witness. Yet, this did not dissuade him from speaking (and continuing to speak to this day) as an expert during many interviews with multiple media outlets. He was after all the founder of WallStreetBets, why shouldn't he have a say in the democratization of finance? 

The truth is, those of us here to remember what happened after the book came out, the ads on the sidebar, the coup that took place, the mass bannings by this man's business partner, and the attempt to sell us an options training and video courses for $1,497 annually, understand who he is. He is a man who will take advantage of those who are looking to get ahead. He is a man who has, and will, take advantage of us. He is a man who partnered with other individuals who have done wrong for a very, very long time. 

Today I'm letting everyone know that another domino has fallen. The men who I've repeatedly warned you about, the men the founder of WSB partnered with, and I discuss in [my videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caoF3jH7yG4&amp;list=PLFn5m64rEzQg5_9Acd9tz0kLGhQ5gsPPn&amp;index=1), are now being held accountable by the SEC. 

[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/33-10994.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/33-10994.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery)

Who are those guys? See ""WallStreetBets Exposed Part 1"" and ""WallStreetBets Exposed Part 3"" for specifics and background that I won't cover here. 

**In total, they will pay over $1,250,000 collectively for violating multiple laws.** And I'm not even talking about the civil suits that are also in progress.

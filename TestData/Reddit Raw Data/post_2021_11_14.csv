Revenue

Polestar sold and delivered 10,000 vehicles in 2020. (10,000 more than LCID). In 2021 they are on track to deliver 29,000 vehicles. (28,400 more than LCID). 

Profitability &amp; Earnings

Expected to be profitable by 2023 and to double LCID sales in 22 and 23. 

TA - Data used (LCID, CHPT, FSR, EVGO, NKLA)

I have studied the primary run that these SPACs had and my research shows that on average the run lasts from 28-35 days on average. 

Valuation

LCID - 72B (for reference)

Polestar expects to double LCID revenue on paper. Lucid is having teething issues with deliveries whereas Polestar is very well established in Europe and is in fact outselling Tesla in some countries. Polestar plans to launch an SUV which by 2023 it is predicted that over 60% of all cars sold will be SUVs. With them being an off brand of Volvo they already have established relationships with material providers and thus can maintain very good margins - keeping costs low and using Volvo parts where they see fit. 

My prediction

2021 Dec - $45

2022 Jan - $30

2023 Jan - $75+",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qto2bl/all_you_can_eat_dd_ggpi/

# How it started:

So we know Elon is selling 10% of his holding, which was at the time of his tweet: 172,6m ordinary shares

He started on monday 8th november and started selling. We know exactly how much he sells each day since he needs to file those numbers to the SEC. You can find them here: [click](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings)

# How it is going:

I found this graphic on Twitter which visualizes his sales in relation to the performance of the Tesla share price:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3hrmb3yqcjz71.png?width=1054&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a65aab7534a889aabfc07a662eeb942f921836da

Original post: [here](https://twitter.com/RawBooty2/status/1459121681549733893)

This shows that Elons sales continously move the price downwards. Please note that the graphic wasnt updated for fridays sales yet. I will update it as soon as its available.

# Now the interesting part We know how many shares he still has to sell !

It is 17,3m shares minus what has been sold already.

**So that is 11,4m shares left for sale**

If we assume he will continue to sell 500 - 639k shares a day as he did the last three days that means **he will be selling for another 18-23 trading days**. Which would be 8th dec - 15th dec

So how do we use this knowledge ?

Well I assume and the shart proves it that the buyers will not be willing to jump in front of the bus while Elon dumps his shares. So there is a really good chance we see lower prices until he is done.

There was a rise in SP on Wednesday but he filed his first SEC report on Wednesday evening.

So ever since it is public knowledge that he **really** started selling and how much he sells it was going down.

# How to play it:

I see several possibilities to take profit from this knowledge

1. Hold puts until Elon is almost done
2. Hold puts until Elon is done and reinvest your gains in calls
3. Look at the daily patterns, caused by Elons broker dumping shares

So i have copied you the last three days charts here, since i dont know how to stack them in one graphic.

You might notice that each day starts with a dip and then a mini rally which peaks between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM. Followed by descending prices through the day.

I know what I am doing next ! And there is \~ 20 days of it to come !

**ST. LOUIS &amp; NEW YORK, November 09, 2021**\--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Panera Brands, which includes the iconic fast casual and hospitality brand Panera Bread as well as Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels, and USHG Acquisition Corp. (NYSE:HUGS) (""HUGS""), a company sponsored by an affiliate of Union Square Hospitality Group, LLC, one of the worlds leading hospitality businesses, announced today that they have signed an agreement through which HUGS will become a cornerstone partner with Panera Brands (the ""Transaction""). Danny Meyer will also invest directly in Panera Brands at the time of the previously announced Panera Brands IPO and become Lead Independent Director of Panera Brands board following completion of the IPO.

**Transaction**

Panera Brands and HUGS entered into a definitive agreement in connection with the Transaction pursuant to which a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Panera Brands will merge with and into HUGS. As a result of the merger:

* Each issued and outstanding share of HUGSs Class A and Class B common stock will be exchanged for a number of shares of Panera Brands common stock at an exchange ratio of $10.00 divided by the public offering price per share in the Panera Brands IPO.
* Each issued and outstanding warrant of HUGS will be assumed by Panera Brands and will become a warrant with respect to Panera Brands common stock, with the number of shares of Panera Brands common stock underlying each warrant adjusted based on the public offering price per share in the Panera Brands IPO in accordance with the terms of the Transaction.
* HUGS will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Panera Brands and Panera Brands will succeed to all of the cash of HUGS, net of closing costs and HUGS shareholder redemptions (which redemptions will be offset, dollar-for-dollar, subject to completion of the Panera Brands IPO, by an investment in shares of Panera Brands common stock by JAB at the public offering price per share in the Panera Brands IPO, as described above).

Closing of the Transaction is subject to completion of the Panera Brands IPO, the requisite HUGS shareholder approval and the satisfaction of other customary conditions.

**Advisors**

J.P. Morgan is acting as financial advisor to Panera Brands on the transaction and Skadden, Arps, State, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP is acting as legal advisor. McDermott, Will &amp; Emory LLP is providing tax advice to Panera Brands. Piper Sandler &amp; Co. is acting as financial advisor to HUGS on the transaction and Latham &amp; Watkins LLP is acting as legal advisor.

I want to do a little thought exercise and yes, I know it will be littered with insults in between, but I've emotionally prepared myself for that... Add to the list below...

Ways AMC Squeezes...

1. More Short Data showing Massive Short Position
2. Some mega celebs getting behind the movement like an Elon Musk
3. AMC surprising by absolutely crushing earnings or a new movie coming out that becomes like a cult movie where everyone sees it in the movie theater for the experience and multiple times. Kind of like 'The Titanic' back in the day.
4. Hedgefunds fall on hard times because of a market crash or too many investors demanding to pull out their money and they have to close out their short positions
5. New rules and strict regulation of dirty hedge fund tactics with an authority that will audit the behavior of shorts causing them to cover.

Ways AMC Struggles...

1. Time. Mannnnny more months go by without any massive movements causing some Apes to tap out.
2. Short data shrinks slowly with time (Shorts covering slowwwwly, with no massive squeezes)
3. Another opportunity arises that's just too damn good to pass up and also has a movement feel behind it with the right intentions and some switch over.

Disclaimer: I am long 225 shares of AMC stock at around $47 a share, but admittedly have a selling target lower than most Apes would agree with. And so I consider myself an AMC monkey at best : ).  
Perhaps the answers to this post can help with that...",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtjx7o/what_the_future_hodls_for_amc/

1,"11/14/2021, 13:35:35",Where $CLOV Revenues could reasonably be in the years to come,HomelessZillionaire,"Ok so Revenue for MA (Medicare Advantage) and DC (Direct Contracting) are two different things.  

**MA Revenue:**  

2021 (9 months ended 9/30)  

$598,390,000  

2020 (9 months ended 9/30)  

$501,100,000  

Thats an increase of 19.4% so far YoY for MA  

**DC Revenue:**  

2021 (9 months ended 9/30)  

$439,020,000  

2020 they didnt have DC so this is obviously a HUGE impact on overall revenue  

*note* 

Q3 was $222,647,000 which is 50.7% of the year-to-date DC revenue so its increasing at a fairly quick rate.   

IMO DC revenue is the game changer for Clover Health. There are only 53 MA providers involved with CMS Direct Contracting Model and most of the incumbent large names are not on the list https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/the-53-participants-in-cms-direct-contracting-model.html

I believe DC will overtake MA revenue over in the near future.  

Overall Revenue: 

2021 (9 months ended 9/30)  

**$1,039,960,000**  

2020 (9 months ended 9/30)  

**$506,655,000** 

Thats an overall Revenue change of 205.3% so far YoY (for 1st 3 quarters)  

So now for where we could be in 5 years lets go by these numbers above and see where it takes us.  

*Side note for comparisons or reasonable predictions*  

{MA Revenue for Q3 was 34% of the year-to-date Revenue. for MA only}  

{DC Revenue for Q3 was 50.7% of the year-to-date Revenue for DC only}  

Lets say they only make $400M in revenue for Q4. 

That would put them at **$1,439,960,000 for 2021.**  
2020 Revenue was **$672,900,000**  

Thats a YoY increase of 213% but thats also with DC and Q4 revenue at $400M  

If they add only $200,000,000 for DC in Q4 the 2021 Revenue for DC would be **$639,020,000** of the total 2021 total Revenue. 

Which DC would be 44.38% of total Revenue  

Lets say they grow at only 150% YoY which is more than conservative knowing at the rate that they aggressively enter new counties. Warrants liabilities gone, COVID should be gone, Stock-based compensation gone, Clover Assistant 5 years into learning. 150% is conservative I think we would all agree there.  

$1.4B 2021 Revenue including both MA and DC  

Increase that 150% YoY  

**2022: $2.1B**  

**2023: $3.15B**  

**2024: $4.725B**  

**2025: $7.09B**  

**2026: $10.63B**  

If you did it by the **213%** theyre growing currently it would be **$61.38B in Revenue by 2026**  

Thats assuming they grow at even close to what theyve been growing.  And thats without Clover Assistant being licensed out to other entities. That would make that $10B number by 2026 more like $100B revenue IMO  

So going by the trend over time I think DC will over take MA as a % of Revenue but as of now it looks like its about 50/50  

Looking even further out the numbers for 2030 by these conservative estimates would be $53.82B Revenue and thats without another Star Ratings upgrade or anything else. 

**If you did it by the 213% currently by 2030 their Revenue would be:**  

**$1,263,410,460,000 (thats $1.263T, thats trillion with a T)**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtj1m7/where_clov_revenues_could_reasonably_be_in_the/

* Spending a ton for new fabs and to compete with TSMC, Samsung, Micron, and Nvidia and to try and ""solve that chip shortage,"" including spending $95B towards new fabs in Europe. &lt;- if they can somehow pull that off, their revenue and market share will grow as TSMC and others wouldn't be able to compete.

Besides the SAFE Banking Act and Republican Legalization Bill, Nancy Mace (US Rep) will be announcing further legalization and/or information regarding the legalization bill at 2PM est. Surprisingly this stock doesn't move as much as the more well known MJ stocks and ETF's, so this is still a nice opportunity to join a delayed rocket. More recently news relating to Red White &amp; Bloom has been their expansion phase in Florida, which will help generate an additional $30mm in nearly 20,000sq space. They will now be operational in California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois and Michigan, they're fast tracking expansion and acquisitions to establish a strong presence in all of these markets, and with the help of their High Times Licensing Agreement to sell their product under the High Times trademark in Florida, Michigan and Illinois. Their partnership alone with the High Times can bring in hundreds of millions in revenue and in attraction on social media platforms - ask yo mom or grandma about it and of course they've heard of The high Times.

**Fundamentals**

Besides all their current progress, there's still a ton of fundamentals to go over. Since this stock is OTC and in the Canadian exchange it's been hard for institutions and large investors to check this stock out, however it's still at a $100mill market cap. Red White &amp; Blooms CEO Brad Rodgers is focusing on brand recognition and cultivation to expand the company - RWB has multiple subsidiaries like the brand Platinum Vapes (which produces $100m current revenue through vape cartridges), Mid-American Growers (which produces and distributes CBD gummies from their own 3.6 Million square feet of automated indoor growing space), as well owning all assets in the Florida operations from Acreage holdings (around 11,000 sqft cultivation facility, and 4,000 sqft administrative office building).

**Technicals**

The first part of the technicals I want to talk about is the all time lows we've seen on the stock, it's dropped under $0.50 just a few times and isn't able to break pass the support line that's been established as time goes on, $0.48 has been hit 4 times with support bouncing it back immediately after since October last year, as well as $0.50 being a key phycological movement for investors to average down back into, and that's been been tested around 8 times since the same time in October (Chart link below as a reference point). 

RWBYF has been accumulating shares and has been consolidating over the past 2 weeks, testing ATL's a few times, seeing the same accumulation before the pump on Jan 4th 2021. And since October 29th  to now, we've seen more volume accumulating compared to the 30 day average (Friday, 11/12/21, RWBYF had 389K volume compared to the 251k avg 30 day volume, and RWB  359k compared to 261k avg 30 day volume. 

 The Volume Profiling indicator is also showing that it can skip past $0.60 with more than average volume and then can consolidating around $0.75 for a while. For those who also already understand volume profiling would agree that $0.6 needs to be filled eventually for more accumulation space, however personally I would believe it jumps to $0.75 before dropping back down after a while.

**Analysis**

Basically I'd go balls deep in this. 

Key statistics though - 

\- EPS at the moment is $-0.294

\- Earnings date between Nov 29 &amp; Dec 3

\- Volume growing more than 40% over the last 30 days

\- CEO Brad Rogers receiving $1.5mill compensation through stock and $300k salary

\- $0.68 Price / Book value

\- Key buying price at $0.5, any massive drop below would leave to it continuing to fall

\- Consolidation is not shown on the chart above as it is a week old, newer data shows that the chart has consolidation from $0.48 to $0.55

\- 63% of Americans, 83% of Democrat's and 50% of Republicans support this movement

\- Estimated to have 300 storefronts in Michigan by 2023

\- THC House of Brands, Platinum Vape &amp; High Times brand gives RWB well known products to sell in over 450 dispensaries across 3 states (Michigan, Illinois, Florida)

\-

**Legalization**

Just like any other marijuana stock you have the risk that MJ potentially might not be legalized or will continually to be delayed for years. However as you probably know, approx. 83% of U.S Democrats  and 50% of Republicans support the legalization of Marijuana. As well as 68% of Americans also support legalizing marijuana. This would come at the cost of taxing MJ at the same rate as Alcohol, which you know, would actually be a good thing that it supports areas where MJ is already a massive market that isn't being taxed for local community growth. 

**Subsidiaries**

Platinum Vapes - Again, back to source 3., they run a huge slice of the pie in Michigan with around 30% of sales from vape cartridges going to them. They are partnered with TILT ($TLLTF, I'm bullish on too) to sell 'Industry leading inhalation technology', top quality cartridges and TILT has the capacity to produce and distribute hundreds of thousands of cartridges on demand, and Platinum Vapes now has the capacity and store front to distribute over 450,000 carts monthly. PV also sell Gummies, CBD, Chocolates, Disposables and some merch. Last year in September PV was making a gross margin around 81%, with adjusted EBITDA (bullshit) of $6.5mill in PV and in PharmaCo (PV subsidiary).

Mid-American Growers - Probably the largest automated harvesting facility in America with 3.6million square feet of CBD producing plants, they offer 12 different CBD products.. not much too it honestly - however a great physical asset for RWB to carry during the next few years. 

**Positions**

Probably worth disclosing that I've been following this stock a month prior to COVID19, I have around 25% of my stock portfolio in Red White &amp; Bloom 

I'm very optimistic about the future of $RWBYF, obviously not endorsed but hell if they gave me free merch I'd be a kiss ass for life. I think it's time sooner or later that this stock and company outperforms the market, it's all in due time. Please do your own proper DD, this is a great starting point to help newer traders / investors finding an opportunity. Most of my family has a position in this, and I'll continue to add more shares as time goes on.

1,"11/14/2021, 08:43:38",My DD on How Dutch Bros Coffee Will Be Heading to $120,COVID20DOOMSDAY,"Hey guys, this will be a DD report compiled of technicals, fundamentals, and random ass sentiment on why I think Dutch Bros will grow to become a $20B company within 6 months. 

The first starts with growth from their latest earnings report last week. Dutch Bros earned 23 cents per share. That was above FactSet estimates for six cents per share.

Revenue rose 49.8% to $129.8 million, also above estimates for $125.2 million. Same-store sales gained 7.3%, above expectations for a 5% increase.

Dutch Bros also forecasts next quarter (Q4) revenue of between $125 million and $128 million. That was above Wall Street estimates for $121.4 million. Despite all this growth, little money was spent on advertising. Most came from word of mouth from the younger generation and their parents who drive them. Looking much further ahead, Dutch Bros plans on expanding to 4,000 stores within 10 years - an aggressive 800% increase from today. 

Their decision to grow company operated stores instead of franchise is why I think their revenue growth will continue to grow exponentially. Heres an excerpt from the 10-Q:

Company-operated Shop Revenue
For the three months ended September 30, 2021, company-operated shop revenue grew 62.9% to $108.7 million, as compared
to $66.7 million in the corresponding prior year period or an increase of $42.0 million. Company-operated shops in the comparable shop base contributed $3.0 million to this increase (4.7% same shop sales), while new company-operated shops
opened during 2020 and 2021 contributed $39.0 million to this increase. For purposes of calculating company-operated same
shop revenue growth, company-operated shop revenue for 145 shops was included in the comparable shop base. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, company-operated shop revenue grew 64.7% to $289.5 million, as compared
to $175.8 million in the corresponding prior year period or an increase of $113.8 million. Company-operated shops in the comparable shop base contributed $11.7 million to this increase (8.3% same shop sales), while new company-operated shops
opened during 2020 and 2021 contributed $102.1 million to this increase. For purposes of calculating company-operated same
shop revenue growth, company-operated shop revenue for 120 shops was included in the comparable shop base.

Now lets transition into the fundamentals. Combining all of the information above with the fact that Starbucks missed on revenue for 3 out of the last 4 quarters tells us in a broader sense that the younger generation is gravitating towards Dutch Bros. It has a much different business model with no inside dining, two separate drive thru windows, outdoor dining that optimizes empty space between the building and drive thru,and youre greeted by a broista who approaches your vehicle rather than a speaker. Customer service and promotions have customers coming back, but most come back simply because the coffee tastes better with more variety than competitors. Dutch Bros doesnt have to spend money on the overhead of a larger building and their outside dining is popular among kids after school. Their app just launched within the year and already has over 2 million users. Coffee only represents 30% of their sales. This shows us how much variety their menu has.

The following is kinda random but it fights against the bear case of market cap divided by store count. $10B/500=$20M per store. We know damn well one of these things dont cost $20M. Are we paying for a store? Or are we paying for the company that runs it? Starbucks has a ratio of $130B/31200=$4M. So a much more established company that owns 62 times more stores than Dutch Bros is getting a 5 times cheaper price per store This leaves us with four options:
1.) Starbucks is 5 times undervalued.
2.) Dutch Bros is 5 times overvalued.
3.) The premium is for future growth potential and with 4,000 stores soon making their way east, the market cap/store count ratio would put the valuation at half of Starbucks. If we considered Starbucks as a base for the ratio which Dutch Bros matched, it would put Dutch Bros at $120 10 years from now. Still a 10% increase YoY. 
4.) Looking at Market Cap is pointless. See Tesla for details.

TLDR: Dutch Bros could become the next Starbucks and they only have 25 million shares in circulation. If you have visited and tasted their coffee before, you know its possible due to next generations preferences and the taste. Very little shares in circulation could send this to $300 if WSB gets behind it. Cramer likes it so maybe we could troll him by making it a meme stock.

**Overview:** For those of you who consider yourself seasoned traders, ignore this... although I promise you that you will learn something. For those of you who have anxiety issues I think this will prove to be an invaluable resource. I'm going to put a lot of time into writing this and it is directed at those who have high amounts of anxiety while trading in the markets.

# Reddit is an Enabler of Trading Anxiety:

Back in the day I used to post a metric ton of highly detailed DD on Reddit. I posted my research on Reddit for a simple reason ... I wanted feedback ... I wanted to crowdsource my DD. One of the predominant issues I continued to run into was few, if any, added any substantive value in the comment section. I would post DD and 2-4 weeks later I would get a flood of comments of folks who never commented on the thread before, but nevertheless tanked me for all the money they made as a result of reading and taking action on a ticker I wrote about. It was then I noticed that people on Reddit are frequently looking for justification to throw money at anything that may bring them a decent return. As it turned out the information I posted provided that justification. But this was not the reason I posted the research. Once again, I wanted to crowd source DD.

I stopped posting DD on Reddit altogether. It was a lot of work for too little feedback. I can do a complete deep dive &amp; workup on a company in my head with a pad and pencil within an hour. Putting it all together and posting it takes considerably more time. I realized that there is a large segment of people wanted to be told what to invest in with a detailed summary as to why. They generally want to know  the risks, they want to know the possible rewards, and they wanted to know when to buy in, average down, and sell. I therefore opted instead to publish a daily newsletter instead of positing on Reddit.

People on Reddit are buying what they don't understand from people they ought not to trust. A great deal of DD on Reddit only comes about when some poor fella is bag holding deep and suddenly realizes that he/she wants to share the amazing value with the world under a misguided understanding that they may be able to generate undue interest in the stock. DD on Reddit is bag holders paradise. Remember more recently when SNAP, WISH, or PTON dumped on very poor earnings? Did you happen to notice all the DD that was posted days to weeks after? Those were bag holders folks. In part, their anxiety from their losses led them to the desperation of taking to Reddit to pitch trash.

Reddit is a trash heap of poorly written ""DD"" and bad advice. For every solid bit of analysis found on reddit there are thousands of poorly written items that are neither ""due"" nor ""diligent."" How much ""DD"" have you seen posted, for example, with absolutely no consideration for the risk factors? If they're missing a risk section can we honestly say they're being ""diligent"" ... or are they just trying to pump a stock? And there are plenty of new retail traders who have absolutely no clue what they're doing for these fellas to prey on.

There is a reasons so many new retail traders are taking to Reddit for answers. Reddit has received a lot of attention in the media as a result of the GME/AMC fiasco. So new retail traders see Reddit as a place to look for guidance, but instead of guidance, they end up looking for profit in a sea of bad advice. Many are new to the market, they do not know how to read the financials, they do not know how to assess economic conditions, and they do not know how to read/assess (or even find) 10-K's, 10-Q's, 8-K's, earnings calls, etc... They do not know how to value a company, how to identify entry &amp; exit points, how to assess debt,  how to conduct competitive analysis and some even think technical analysis is all you need. They do not know how to assess trailing PE, forward PE, PB, BVPS, PEG, current ratios, PS, Enterprise Value, GAAP EPS, NON GAAP EPS, operating margin, and the list goes on &amp; on &amp; on. And even if they could somewhat do all of this, they don't have the time. So what's the result? ... Massive amounts of confusion, massive amounts of ignorance, and massive amounts of the fear of the unknown.

# Fear of the Unknown is the Number One Reason for Trader Anxiety:

The reason that most of you  suffer from trading anxiety is a lack of confidence in your picks which leads to a great deal of fear of the unknown. And there is only one way to eliminate the fear of the unknown. ELEMINATE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THE UNKNOWN. And if you're are trying to eliminate the unknown through scrolling through insufficient DD posts on reddit, then your anxiety will likely be amplified when you suddenly find out that most of your trades will fail.

# Eliminating the Unknown will Eliminate Anxiety:

Before I retired, I spent 8 years in the Marines as an Infantryman and 13 years in the Army as an intelligence analyst. I've been on the receiving end of information and the production end of information. I've seen the horrible results of bad information, and the absolutely amazing successes in good information. In my experience analysis should overwhelmingly be risk based. Assessing and mitigating risk in my former line of work meant an increased likelihood of mission success, friendly lives saved, and civilian lives saved. The less risk you assess the higher the threat, and therefore, the higher the anxiety. I approach trading in the same fashion. And I know from experience the largest risks come from the unknowns. Learning to identify and spot those unknowns comes largely from experience but you need to begin somewhere. There are 3 types of unknowns.

* **Known Unknows:** These are the items you know you do not know. The overwhelming amount of your effort when assessing an equity is dedicated to filling in the gaps of those items you know you do not know, but would like to know. And much of it is easy to find, but what if you can't? There are many cases in which you would like to know something but the information is not available. In those cases you look for indicators of the information requirements you need to make your case.
* **Unknown Knowns:** These are things you know, but either forgot you knew, or failed to apply it to your analysis. To remedy this you simply need to critically think about what you know and how it applies to your analysis.
* **Unknown Unknowns:** This is perhaps the most dangerous, as it is ALMOST completely derived from ignorance. The more ignorant we are on a certain subject matter the more we run into unknown unknowns. Once you've started on your known knowns, identified your known unknowns (and their indicators), assessed your unknown knowns, you draw your attention to the unknown unknowns. Essentially this is asking ""what the hell am I missing and where can I go to find it,"" or ""where can I look to find the things I do not know I'm missing?""

# Eliminating the Unknown and Mitigating Anxiety:

Investing first and researching later is no way to go about business and it can greatly increase your anxiety! The more you know about your company and the current and future economic conditions, the less anxiety you will have. (Note: Much of the data referenced below can be found under the statics tab of any given company on Yahoo Finance.

* **Assessing the Know Knowns:** When you begin your analysis you will always start with assessing what you know. You know, that no matter what company you're looking at, you will generally want the following:
   * A forward PE (Price to Earnings) that is lower than the trailing PE, unless you think the market forward PE consensus is wrong.
   * A PE that is relatively lower than sector/industry peers unless you are expecting massive growth.
   * A BV (Book Value) and BVPS (Book Value Per Share) that is closer to the market cap/share price as possible as compared to industry peers.
   * A PS (Price to Sales) ratio of one or less (ideally less than industry/sector peers) of unless, once again, you're expecting massive future growth.
   * A PEG (Price to Earnings Growth) ratio of one or less unless you are pricing in massive growth (Few if any tech companies have a PEG ratio less than one).
   * An enterprise value that is near, or higher than, market cap. Unless, once again, you are expecting massive growth. Companies that have a enterprise value significantly lower than market cap can be possible buyout opportunities.
   * Manageable debt relatively lower than industry peers. (A current ratio above 1 but lower than 5)
   * The company can pay their dividend (see payout ratio)
   * A solid amount of cash on hand.
   * Moderate to high amounts of institutional investment.
   * A solid and growing operating cash flow and operating margin.
   * Increasing YoY Quarterly Revenue Growth and YoY Quarterly EPS Growth.
   * Trading at a value on a pullback of no negative consequence.
   * Solid forward guidance
   * A history of insider confidence through insider buying
   * Solid buy rating analyst coverage and upgrades (Take it with a grain of salt, there are more shitty analysts out there than stars in the sky).
   * Share buybacks are always nice
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Company:** You can never eliminate all the unknowns about the company. But you can ask yourself the following:
   * Is the company at risk for an offering?
   * Can future revenues cover additional debt and reinvestment?
   * What are the chances the company does not preform as expected?
   * How critical will it be for my investment if the company misses EPS projections? Its an important question to ask. Companies underperform EPS all the time amid earnings. More often than not it means the company is still growing, just not at the rate analysts expected. For most profitable companies, missing EPS projections does NOT mean the company isn't profitable. Companies with a positive EPS should typically be better off this quarter on the books than the previous quarter.
   * Is the company's goals realistic and obtainable?
   * Is the company under or over shooting projected guidance?
   * Are analysts under or over shooting guidance?
   * Is the space the company competes in overcrowded?
   * Is the company losing or gaining market share as compared to competitors?
   * Does the company have a competitive advantage or disadvantage?
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Current and Future Economic Conditions:** This can be tough but at minimum you should study current and upcoming economic datasets and ask how a positive or negative change in the various categories affects your company. You will also want to come up with your own short, medium, and long term projection of economic conditions and how they will affect your company. Always pay attention to the economic calendar!
   * Inflation Rate (Low is good for preventing dramatic shifts in personal spending, high id good for paying off long term debt)
   * Semiconductor Shortage
   * Worker Shortage (Can they meet demand with the workers they got? If not can they beat previous quarters EPS with the workers they got?)
   * Supply Chain Bottlenecks (Check their domestic inventories as a solid indicator of how affected they are by this)
   * Rising fuel and Energy Costs
   * Rising Shipping Costs
   * Government &amp; Regulatory Environment
   * Federal Reserve Policy
   * Reliance on China and Chinese Economic/Regulatory Environment
   * Unemployment Rate and Labor Force Participation Rate (Too high less people are buying, too low and the cost of labor goes up)
   * Always Pay Close Attention to the ECONOMIC CALANDER and the results reported!

# Perspective and Expectation Management Also Mitigates Anxiety:

It's gonna go to the moooooon!!!! No it isn't! Read my part on Big money below to find out why. It's important that you have reasonable expectations. It's important that you have a decent and realistic perspective on the outcome of your trade. Doing this will go leaps and bounds toward mitigating your anxiety.

* **There is NO Such thing as a Perfect Stock:**  If your anxiety is so through the roof that you're forgoing great trades on good companies, cut that shit out! There is no such thing as a perfect stock and you will always need to accept a certain degree of risk!
* **Do not Sweat Minor Misses in EPS:** You're company barely missed analysts EPS or Revenue Expectations? So what!!?? Are they profitable? Are they growing? If they had positive revenue or EPS, chances are they're still growing on the books. Sure their rate of growth may have changed but they're adding money to the balance sheet! It would be one thing if they lowered guidance, but short of that a small EPS miss isn't nothing to frown upon and might put you in the position to buy some more stock for a cheaper price on a really good company! If holding a little longer gives you anxiety then its because you're attempting to get money quick by swinging trades, which is fine, but can add an additional layer of anxiety.
* **Expect the Unexpected and Have a Plan:** Black Swans happen. Major unexpected economic shifts happen. Your dry bulk carrier will catch fire or lose their cargo in the ocean. Oil companies will have spills. Companies get sued all the time. Adjusted economic numbers come out every day of the week. Your stock WILL NOT trade as everyone expects it to. Get used to this and you will mitigate your anxiety. Buy in slowly and have a plan, and you will mitigate it even more.
* **Analysts are Always Wrong:** Firstly it is important to understand that analyst price targets are where the analyst expects the stock to be in a year or so. Not right now. I see a lot of retail traders complaining about the company share price not being at the analyst price target. Its ridiculous expectation management!
* **Understand how Big Money Operates and Expect their Antics!:**  When large institutions dealing in millions to billions of dollars decide to buy or sell a stock, they are well aware that they will inevitably move the share price. The volume they create can be massive. To mitigate this they will either sell calls or buy puts when they sell a considerable lot of shares, or buy calls or sell puts when they buy a considerable lot of shares. Therefore it is important to understand that institutions can often make money no matter which way the stock trades. Unlike most retail traders they even have the option to go both long &amp; short on the same security at the same time. They can, &amp; do, often go short to take advantage of the bearish sentiment they inevitably create while selling large blocks of shares while locking in their profit using a combination of options strategies. Always remember that retail does not own the market  big money does. This reality forces us to come to grips with the necessity not to fight them, but to ride their backs. This includes having the discipline &amp; courage of our convictions to hold through the bearish sentiment institutions inevitably create, on perfectly good companies, when some big firm takes profit. Consider retail traders like ourselves the small Remora Fish attached to a large Great White Shark (The Institutions), waiting to ride their backs out of but a temporary rut of no true consequence.
* **Trading Psychology:** Psychology plays a large part of why stocks can continue to trade below street value. Once a stock sells off due to large institutional profit taking, the street wonders why. Does someone know something we dont? Was there some economic data that cast bearish sentiment on this particular industry or sector? Does the street expect the company to act in a way that will lower its valuation? Such questions, &amp; many more, arent just asked by us. Theyre asked by everyone who holds a position in the company we do. Even analysts may downgrade a stock for no other reason than to tailor their expectations a year out from now. Indeed they hate to be wrong, &amp; they always are. So do not be surprised not only when a security we thought was already undervalued sells off further than expected, but also stays down as it may take time for traders to feel comfortable entering again. Corrections back to street value can often take a few weeks to a few months. Sometimes until next earnings to relive fears of both retail &amp; large institutions.

# Processes Mitigate Anxiety:

Processes mitigate anxiety. The more efficient the process the less time you spend searching for places to put that money that's burning a hole in your pocket. Some traders feel as though they are in a rush to hurry up and strike while the iron is hot and put their money somewhere only to find out that  they rushed their trades and realized a loss. Below is my process and a few additional pointers for researching equities and it mitigates A LOT of my personal trader anxiety.

1. **Assess the Economic Conditions First!:** Assessing the economic conditions first grants you the opportunity to single out those sectors that stand to benefit the most from current and future economic conditions. If you do not know how to do this please see an earlier post I made on WSB on that very topic. Also investing in companies that stand to benefit the most from economic conditions gives you an extra layer of confidence to fight anxiety.
2. **Make a Price Based Assessment Watchlist and Set your Alerts:** A Price Based Assessment Watchlist is simply adding companies that you've 1. Assessed the Current or Future Economic Conditions as Favorable. 2. Done a Quick Review of the Company Financials. 3. Set your alert at your desired reassessment price. ONLY when that alert hits is when you do the rest of your research and DD. That way you ONLY use your valuable time on the most promising of circumstances. That way you aren't frantically searching and scrolling for plays, but letting the plays come to you, which helps with anxiety!
3. **Buy on a Pullback of Little to No Negative Consequence:** I love a good dump. Perhaps it comes from a bad market day, perhaps it comes from the sector in general doing poorly that day, and perhaps it comes from a whale taking profit. I don't care. If the financials are great, I expect them to grow, and the economic conditions are favorable, such a pullback will trigger my buy alerts letting me know its time for a starter position. But first I do a quick assessment to see if there is any recent negative news that is driving down the share price. If there is negative news, I ask myself to what degree is the news of legitimate financial substance to the growth prospects of the company. If very little, I'll be happy to buy that dip. Some would argue that they want to jump in on solid relative strength. Yeah ... they're chasing and I don't chase. I like it when its cold, not when its hot. Later, when my thesis becomes true, then it gets hot and I watch everyone else chase. But buying on a pullback of little to no consequence will give you that extra layer of value and security you may have been looking for. You wont be worried if the security is over pumped and about to fall, but rather patiently waiting for it to pump again. I think the latter of the two holds less anxiety. More profitable too!
4. **Keep Track of the News:** If you want to monitor your investments stop looking at the chart and read all the news that comes out on your company. Two good places to do this are seeking alpha (Put the ticker in and click the news tab) and, believe it or not, StockTwits! The bots and the news scroller on StockTwits are money! Ignore the people there, read the news scroller! Also set prices you want to review 5% above or below your starter position price and program your broker app to alert you when they hit those points. Its a lot more easy to go about your day that way, and waaay less anxiety when you can be rest assured that at minimum you have lost too much.

# Anxiety Mitigating Rules to Live by:

Some added anxiety killing tips!

* **If you aren't willing to hold the stock long term, stay away from it!:** So you think you're going to swing it real quick and get out so you don't need to put too much effort into the trade? Think again. The technical analysis fella on YouTube may have a pretty set up, but he's going to throw your anxiety through the roof. And only IF you're lucky, you MAY make a profit.
* **Quit Checking your Phone, Set Alerts Instead:** Set share price points where you want to be alerted and quit checking your phone. I promise you that your anxiety is really going to increase when you're fired from work because you spend too much time checking your investments and too little time getting anything done.
* **Stay Away from Risky Options Strategies:** So you wanted to get rich quick so you bough a bunch of naked calls or puts? All or nothing baby!! Well there goes your anxiety. The more professional you are with options the less anxiety you'll have.
* **Be a Net Options Seller:** Covered calls while you're waiting for your position to turn over long periods of time is a great idea. Its like getting a free dividend and it lowers your cost basis. I've been selling Ammo Inc. calls for the last three months and in addition to profiting from the increase in share price, I've cashed in $0.56 in premium per share, an 9% gain on the overall position on options premium alone. At this point I don't care how the stock trades. Talk about low anxiety huh? I'll sell calls till the cows come home and if the shareprice on the last day before expiry is slightly over the strike on the calls I sold, pending I want to hold on to the shares I'll just roll the options to another month for additional premium. Furthermore when I can't get a stock for the price I want I often just sell an in the money cash secured put if the options premium is worth it. Lets say a stock is trading for $6.00 but the $7.50 strike put is trading for $2.70. That means the real price to me if assigned is $4.80 per share. Talk about a steal! I'll sell that contract all day every day! And with practically no anxiety.
* **Don't buy in all at once, do NOT chase!:** Don't just throw in a full allocation all at once on a stock. Rather establish a starter position and buy in slowly in the red. This will greatly lower your cost average and increase your profitability. For example, if you established a starter position but now you find yourself down 5%, you can just buy an equally sized position and now you only need the stock to increase 2.5% to recover from your loss. Does this help with your anxiety? You bet it does! Finally, if the stock skyrockets don't chase it. Enjoy the profit and move on. Chasing has been the windowmaker of plenty of traders ... particularly in the penny stock world.
* **Stay away from unprofitable companies and Penny Stocks:** This speaks for itself. I have analyzed a the risk on a bunch of penstocks. And unprofitable companies can often disappoint. Indeed the volatility is there, and there is profit to be made amid volatility. However trust me when I tell you that if you are reading this, it means you likely need help in your trading habits, and you should just stay away from penny stocks and unprofitable companies.
* **BUY RELIABLY RPOFITABLE COMPANIES PRIMED FOR GROWTH, TRADING AT A SECTOR RELATIVE VALUE, ON A PULLBACK OF NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE, WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT, UNDER FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS!:** Swing for grand slams and you'll strike out, or ground out nearly every time. Swing for base hits and you'll hit base hits, home runs, and grand slams on a very regular basis!

# You will NEVER Get Rid of All of your Anxiety:

Its got to be said! You will never get rid of all of your anxiety. You just put a significant amount of cash you worked hard for into shares of a company subject to both positive and negative market forces. There will always be unknowns. Therefore, there will always be anxiety.

**TL;DR:** First, I HIGHLY suggest you read this if you fee that you are the target audience. The thesis above speaks to the fact that anxiety in trading largely comes from the unknown, &amp; the more you mitigate the unknown the less anxiety you will experience. Above there are plenty of steps you can do to mitigate the unknown, thereby developing your confidence, and become a more profitable trader. I also argue that you can mitigate a large portion of your anxiety simply by understanding what you're buying in an equity, understand the markets, understanding trading techniques, developing a sense of perspective, and buying ""*reliably profitable companies, primed for growth, trading a sector relative value, on pullback of little to no negative consequence, with a decent amount of institutional investment, under favorable economic conditions.*"" This post is for people serious about mitigating their anxiety and learnings how to trade in a manner that will benefit both their mental health and their wallets. In summary, if traders respect their own money and do what they're supposed to do, it will go a long way to mitigating anxiety.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtcgl9/understanding_and_attacking_trader_anxiety_aka/

Note: Its a long post. Please don't forget to upvote if you like the content. I worked hard on it and I want folks who experience trader anxiety to benefit from my work.

**Overview:** For those of you who consider yourself seasoned traders, ignore this... although I promise you that you will learn something. For those of you who have anxiety issues I think this will prove to be an invaluable resource. I'm going to put a lot of time into writing this and it is directed at those who have high amounts of anxiety while trading in the markets.

# Reddit is an Enabler of Trading Anxiety:

Back in the day I used to post a metric ton of highly detailed DD on Reddit. I posted my research on Reddit for a simple reason ... I wanted feedback ... I wanted to crowdsource my DD. One of the predominant issues I continued to run into was few, if any, added any substantive value in the comment section. I would post DD and 2-4 weeks later I would get a flood of comments of folks who never commented on the thread before, but nevertheless tanked me for all the money they made as a result of reading and taking action on a ticker I wrote about. It was then I noticed that people on Reddit are frequently looking for justification to throw money at anything that may bring them a decent return. As it turned out the information I posted provided that justification. But this was not the reason I posted the research. Once again, I wanted to crowd source DD.

I stopped posting DD on Reddit altogether. It was a lot of work for too little feedback. I can do a complete deep dive &amp; workup on a company in my head with a pad and pencil within an hour. Putting it all together and posting it takes considerably more time. I realized that there is a large segment of people wanted to be told what to invest in with a detailed summary as to why. They generally want to know  the risks, they want to know the possible rewards, and they wanted to know when to buy in, average down, and sell. I therefore opted instead to publish a daily newsletter instead of positing on Reddit.

People on Reddit are buying what they don't understand from people they ought not to trust. A great deal of DD on Reddit only comes about when some poor fella is bag holding deep and suddenly realizes that he/she wants to share the amazing value with the world under a misguided understanding that they may be able to generate undue interest in the stock. DD on Reddit is bag holders paradise. Remember more recently when SNAP, WISH, or PTON dumped on very poor earnings? Did you happen to notice all the DD that was posted days to weeks after? Those were bag holders folks. In part, their anxiety from their losses led them to the desperation of taking to Reddit to pitch trash.

Reddit is a trash heap of poorly written ""DD"" and bad advice. For every solid bit of analysis found on reddit there are thousands of poorly written items that are neither ""due"" nor ""diligent."" How much ""DD"" have you seen posted, for example, with absolutely no consideration for the risk factors? If they're missing a risk section can we honestly say they're being ""diligent"" ... or are they just trying to pump a stock? And there are plenty of new retail traders who have absolutely no clue what they're doing for these fellas to prey on.

There is a reasons so many new retail traders are taking to Reddit for answers. Reddit has received a lot of attention in the media as a result of the GME/AMC fiasco. So new retail traders see Reddit as a place to look for guidance, but instead of guidance, they end up looking for profit in a sea of bad advice. Many are new to the market, they do not know how to read the financials, they do not know how to assess economic conditions, and they do not know how to read/assess (or even find) 10-K's, 10-Q's, 8-K's, earnings calls, etc... They do not know how to value a company, how to identify entry &amp; exit points, how to assess debt,  how to conduct competitive analysis and some even think technical analysis is all you need. They do not know how to assess trailing PE, forward PE, PB, BVPS, PEG, current ratios, PS, Enterprise Value, GAAP EPS, NON GAAP EPS, operating margin, and the list goes on &amp; on &amp; on. And even if they could somewhat do all of this, they don't have the time. So what's the result? ... Massive amounts of confusion, massive amounts of ignorance, and massive amounts of the fear of the unknown.

# Fear of the Unknown is the Number One Reason for Trader Anxiety:

The reason that most of you  suffer from trading anxiety is a lack of confidence in your picks which leads to a great deal of fear of the unknown. And there is only one way to eliminate the fear of the unknown. ELEMINATE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THE UNKNOWN. And if you're are trying to eliminate the unknown through scrolling through insufficient DD posts on reddit, then your anxiety will likely be amplified when you suddenly find out that most of your trades will fail.

# Eliminating the Unknown will Eliminate Anxiety:

Before I retired, I spent 8 years in the Marines as an Infantryman and 13 years in the Army as an intelligence analyst. I've been on the receiving end of information and the production end of information. I've seen the horrible results of bad information, and the absolutely amazing successes in good information. In my experience analysis should overwhelmingly be risk based. Assessing and mitigating risk in my former line of work meant an increased likelihood of mission success, friendly lives saved, and civilian lives saved. The less risk you assess the higher the threat, and therefore, the higher the anxiety. I approach trading in the same fashion. And I know from experience the largest risks come from the unknowns. Learning to identify and spot those unknowns comes largely from experience but you need to begin somewhere. There are 3 types of unknowns.

* **Known Unknows:** These are the items you know you do not know. The overwhelming amount of your effort when assessing an equity is dedicated to filling in the gaps of those items you know you do not know, but would like to know. And much of it is easy to find, but what if you can't? There are many cases in which you would like to know something but the information is not available. In those cases you look for indicators of the information requirements you need to make your case.
* **Unknown Knowns:** These are things you know, but either forgot you knew, or failed to apply it to your analysis. To remedy this you simply need to critically think about what you know and how it applies to your analysis.
* **Unknown Unknowns:** This is perhaps the most dangerous, as it is ALMOST completely derived from ignorance. The more ignorant we are on a certain subject matter the more we run into unknown unknowns. Once you've started on your known knowns, identified your known unknowns (and their indicators), assessed your unknown knowns, you draw your attention to the unknown unknowns. Essentially this is asking ""what the hell am I missing and where can I go to find it,"" or ""where can I look to find the things I do not know I'm missing?""

# Eliminating the Unknown and Mitigating Anxiety:

Investing first and researching later is no way to go about business and it can greatly increase your anxiety! The more you know about your company and the current and future economic conditions, the less anxiety you will have. (Note: Much of the data referenced below can be found under the statics tab of any given company on Yahoo Finance.

* **Assessing the Know Knowns:** When you begin your analysis you will always start with assessing what you know. You know, that no matter what company you're looking at, you will generally want the following:
   * A forward PE (Price to Earnings) that is lower than the trailing PE, unless you think the market forward PE consensus is wrong.
   * A PE that is relatively lower than sector/industry peers unless you are expecting massive growth.
   * A BV (Book Value) and BVPS (Book Value Per Share) that is closer to the market cap/share price as possible as compared to industry peers.
   * A PS (Price to Sales) ratio of one or less (ideally less than industry/sector peers) of unless, once again, you're expecting massive future growth.
   * A PEG (Price to Earnings Growth) ratio of one or less unless you are pricing in massive growth (Few if any tech companies have a PEG ratio less than one).
   * An enterprise value that is near, or higher than, market cap. Unless, once again, you are expecting massive growth. Companies that have a enterprise value significantly lower than market cap can be possible buyout opportunities.
   * Manageable debt relatively lower than industry peers. (A current ratio above 1 but lower than 5)
   * The company can pay their dividend (see payout ratio)
   * A solid amount of cash on hand.
   * Moderate to high amounts of institutional investment.
   * A solid and growing operating cash flow and operating margin.
   * Increasing YoY Quarterly Revenue Growth and YoY Quarterly EPS Growth.
   * Trading at a value on a pullback of no negative consequence.
   * Solid forward guidance
   * A history of insider confidence through insider buying
   * Solid buy rating analyst coverage and upgrades (Take it with a grain of salt, there are more shitty analysts out there than stars in the sky).
   * Share buybacks are always nice
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Company:** You can never eliminate all the unknowns about the company. But you can ask yourself the following:
   * Is the company at risk for an offering?

3. **Buy on a Pullback of Little to No Negative Consequence:** I love a good dump. Perhaps it comes from a bad market day, perhaps it comes from the sector in general doing poorly that day, and perhaps it comes from a whale taking profit. I don't care. If the financials are great, I expect them to grow, and the economic conditions are favorable, such a pullback will trigger my buy alerts letting me know its time for a starter position. But first I do a quick assessment to see if there is any recent negative news that is driving down the share price. If there is negative news, I ask myself to what degree is the news of legitimate financial substance to the growth prospects of the company. If very little, I'll be happy to buy that dip. Some would argue that they want to jump in on solid relative strength. Yeah ... they're chasing and I don't chase. I like it when its cold, not when its hot. Later, when my thesis becomes true, then it gets hot and I watch everyone else chase. But buying on a pullback of little to no consequence will give you that extra layer of value and security you may have been looking for. You wont be worried if the security is over pumped and about to fall, but rather patiently waiting for it to pump again. I think the latter of the two holds less anxiety. More profitable too!
4. **Keep Track of the News:** If you want to monitor your investments stop looking at the chart and read all the news that comes out on your company. Two good places to do this are seeking alpha (Put the ticker in and click the news tab) and, believe it or not, StockTwits! The bots and the news scroller on StockTwits are money! Ignore the people there, read the news scroller! Also set prices you want to review 5% above or below your starter position price and program your broker app to alert you when they hit those points. Its a lot more easy to go about your day that way, and waaay less anxiety when you can be rest assured that at minimum you have lost too much.

# Anxiety Mitigating Rules to Live by:

Some added anxiety killing tips!

* **If you aren't willing to hold the stock long term, stay away from it!:** So you think you're going to swing it real quick and get out so you don't need to put too much effort into the trade? Think again. The technical analysis fella on YouTube may have a pretty set up, but he's going to throw your anxiety through the roof. And only IF you're lucky, you MAY make a profit.
* **Quit Checking your Phone, Set Alerts Instead:** Set share price points where you want to be alerted and quit checking your phone. I promise you that your anxiety is really going to increase when you're fired from work because you spend too much time checking your investments and too little time getting anything done.
* **Stay Away from Risky Options Strategies:** So you wanted to get rich quick so you bough a bunch of naked calls or puts? All or nothing baby!! Well there goes your anxiety. The more professional you are with options the less anxiety you'll have.
* **Be a Net Options Seller:** Covered calls while you're waiting for your position to turn over long periods of time is a great idea. Its like getting a free dividend and it lowers your cost basis. I've been selling Ammo Inc. calls for the last three months and in addition to profiting from the increase in share price, I've cashed in $0.56 in premium per share, an 9% gain on the overall position on options premium alone. At this point I don't care how the stock trades. Talk about low anxiety huh? I'll sell calls till the cows come home and if the shareprice on the last day before expiry is slightly over the strike on the calls I sold, pending I want to hold on to the shares I'll just roll the options to another month for additional premium. Furthermore when I can't get a stock for the price I want I often just sell an in the money cash secured put if the options premium is worth it. Lets say a stock is trading for $6.00 but the $7.50 strike put is trading for $2.70. That means the real price to me if assigned is $4.80 per share. Talk about a steal! I'll sell that contract all day every day! And with practically no anxiety.
* **Don't buy in all at once, do NOT chase!:** Don't just throw in a full allocation all at once on a stock. Rather establish a starter position and buy in slowly in the red. This will greatly lower your cost average and increase your profitability. For example, if you established a starter position but now you find yourself down 5%, you can just buy an equally sized position and now you only need the stock to increase 2.5% to recover from your loss. Does this help with your anxiety? You bet it does! Finally, if the stock skyrockets don't chase it. Enjoy the profit and move on. Chasing has been the windowmaker of plenty of traders ... particularly in the penny stock world.
* **Stay away from unprofitable companies and Penny Stocks:** This speaks for itself. I have analyzed a the risk on a bunch of penstocks. And unprofitable companies can often disappoint. Indeed the volatility is there, and there is profit to be made amid volatility. However trust me when I tell you that if you are reading this, it means you likely need help in your trading habits, and you should just stay away from penny stocks and unprofitable companies.
* **BUY RELIABLY RPOFITABLE COMPANIES PRIMED FOR GROWTH, TRADING AT A SECTOR RELATIVE VALUE, ON A PULLBACK OF NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE, WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT, UNDER FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS!:** Swing for grand slams and you'll strike out, or ground out nearly every time. Swing for base hits and you'll hit base hits, home runs, and grand slams on a very regular basis!

# You will NEVER Get Rid of All of your Anxiety:

Its got to be said! You will never get rid of all of your anxiety. You just put a significant amount of cash you worked hard for into shares of a company subject to both positive and negative market forces. There will always be unknowns. Therefore, there will always be anxiety.

**TL;DR:** First, I HIGHLY suggest you read this if you fee that you are the target audience. The thesis above speaks to the fact that anxiety in trading largely comes from the unknown, &amp; the more you mitigate the unknown the less anxiety you will experience. Above there are plenty of steps you can do to mitigate the unknown, thereby developing your confidence, and become a more profitable trader. I also argue that you can mitigate a large portion of your anxiety simply by understanding what you're buying in an equity, understand the markets, understanding trading techniques, developing a sense of perspective, and buying ""*reliably profitable companies, primed for growth, trading a sector relative value, on pullback of little to no negative consequence, with a decent amount of institutional investment, under favorable economic conditions.*"" This post is for people serious about mitigating their anxiety and learnings how to trade in a manner that will benefit both their mental health and their wallets.

Note: Its a long post. Please don't forget to upvote if you like the content. I worked hard on it and I want folks who experience trader anxiety to benefit from my work.

**Overview:** For those of you who consider yourself seasoned traders, ignore this... although I promise you that you will learn something. For those of you who have anxiety issues I think this will prove to be an invaluable resource. I'm going to put a lot of time into writing this and it is directed at those who have high amounts of anxiety while trading in the markets.

# Reddit is an Enabler of Trading Anxiety:

Back in the day I used to post a metric ton of highly detailed DD on Reddit. I posted my research on Reddit for a simple reason ... I wanted feedback ... I wanted to crowdsource my DD. One of the predominant issues I continued to run into was few, if any, added any substantive value in the comment section. I would post DD and 2-4 weeks later I would get a flood of comments of folks who never commented on the thread before, but nevertheless tanked me for all the money they made as a result of reading and taking action on a ticker I wrote about. It was then I noticed that people on Reddit are frequently looking for justification to throw money at anything that may bring them a decent return. As it turned out the information I posted provided that justification. But this was not the reason I posted the research. Once again, I wanted to crowd source DD.

I stopped posting DD on Reddit altogether. It was a lot of work for too little feedback. I can do a complete deep dive &amp; workup on a company in my head with a pad and pencil within an hour. Putting it all together and posting it takes considerably more time. I realized that there is a large segment of people wanted to be told what to invest in with a detailed summary as to why. They generally want to know  the risks, they want to know the possible rewards, and they wanted to know when to buy in, average down, and sell. I therefore opted instead to publish a daily newsletter instead of positing on Reddit.

People on Reddit are buying what they don't understand from people they ought not to trust. A great deal of DD on Reddit only comes about when some poor fella is bag holding deep and suddenly realizes that he/she wants to share the amazing value with the world under a misguided understanding that they may be able to generate undue interest in the stock. DD on Reddit is bag holders paradise. Remember more recently when SNAP, WISH, or PTON dumped on very poor earnings? Did you happen to notice all the DD that was posted days to weeks after? Those were bag holders folks. In part, their anxiety from their losses led them to the desperation of taking to Reddit to pitch trash.

Reddit is a trash heap of poorly written ""DD"" and bad advice. For every solid bit of analysis found on reddit there are thousands of poorly written items that are neither ""due"" nor ""diligent."" How much ""DD"" have you seen posted, for example, with absolutely no consideration for the risk factors? If they're missing a risk section can we honestly say they're being ""diligent"" ... or are they just trying to pump a stock? And there are plenty of new retail traders who have absolutely no clue what they're doing for these fellas to prey on.

There is a reasons so many new retail traders are taking to Reddit for answers. Reddit has received a lot of attention in the media as a result of the GME/AMC fiasco. So new retail traders see Reddit as a place to look for guidance, but instead of guidance, they end up looking for profit in a sea of bad advice. Many are new to the market, they do not know how to read the financials, they do not know how to assess economic conditions, and they do not know how to read/assess (or even find) 10-K's, 10-Q's, 8-K's, earnings calls, etc... They do not know how to value a company, how to identify entry &amp; exit points, how to assess debt,  how to conduct competitive analysis and some even think technical analysis is all you need. They do not know how to assess trailing PE, forward PE, PB, BVPS, PEG, current ratios, PS, Enterprise Value, GAAP EPS, NON GAAP EPS, operating margin, and the list goes on &amp; on &amp; on. And even if they could somewhat do all of this, they don't have the time. So what's the result? ... Massive amounts of confusion, massive amounts of ignorance, and massive amounts of the fear of the unknown.

# Fear of the Unknown is the Number One Reason for Trader Anxiety:

The reason that most of you  suffer from trading anxiety is a lack of confidence in your picks which leads to a great deal of fear of the unknown. And there is only one way to eliminate the fear of the unknown. ELEMINATE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THE UNKNOWN. And if you're are trying to eliminate the unknown through scrolling through insufficient DD posts on reddit, then your anxiety will likely be amplified when you suddenly find out that most of your trades will fail.

# Eliminating the Unknown will Eliminate Anxiety:

Before I retired, I spent 8 years in the Marines as an Infantryman and 13 years in the Army as an intelligence analyst. I've been on the receiving end of information and the production end of information. I've seen the horrible results of bad information, and the absolutely amazing successes in good information. In my experience analysis should overwhelmingly be risk based. Assessing and mitigating risk in my former line of work meant an increased likelihood of mission success, friendly lives saved, and civilian lives saved. The less risk you assess the higher the threat, and therefore, the higher the anxiety. I approach trading in the same fashion. And I know from experience the largest risks come from the unknowns. Learning to identify and spot those unknowns comes largely from experience but you need to begin somewhere. There are 3 types of unknowns.

* **Known Unknows:** These are the items you know you do not know. The overwhelming amount of your effort when assessing an equity is dedicated to filling in the gaps of those items you know you do not know, but would like to know. And much of it is easy to find, but what if you can't? There are many cases in which you would like to know something but the information is not available. In those cases you look for indicators of the information requirements you need to make your case.
* **Unknown Knowns:** These are things you know, but either forgot you knew, or failed to apply it to your analysis. To remedy this you simply need to critically think about what you know and how it applies to your analysis.
* **Unknown Unknowns:** This is perhaps the most dangerous, as it is ALMOST completely derived from ignorance. The more ignorant we are on a certain subject matter the more we run into unknown unknowns. Once you've started on your known knowns, identified your known unknowns (and their indicators), assessed your unknown knowns, you draw your attention to the unknown unknowns. Essentially this is asking ""what the hell am I missing and where can I go to find it,"" or ""where can I look to find the things I do not know I'm missing?""

# Eliminating the Unknown and Mitigating Anxiety:

Investing first and researching later is no way to go about business and it can greatly increase your anxiety! The more you know about your company and the current and future economic conditions, the less anxiety you will have. (Note: Much of the data referenced below can be found under the statics tab of [any given company on Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL).

* **Assessing the Know Knowns:** When you begin your analysis you will always start with assessing what you know. You know, that no matter what company you're looking at, you will generally want the following:
   * A forward PE (Price to Earnings) that is lower than the trailing PE, unless you think the market forward PE consensus is wrong.
   * A PE that is relatively lower than sector/industry peers unless you are expecting massive growth.
   * A BV (Book Value) and BVPS (Book Value Per Share) that is closer to the market cap/share price as possible as compared to industry peers.
   * A PS (Price to Sales) ratio of one or less (ideally less than industry/sector peers) of unless, once again, you're expecting massive future growth.
   * A PEG (Price to Earnings Growth) ratio of one or less unless you are pricing in massive growth (Few if any tech companies have a PEG ratio less than one).
   * An enterprise value that is near, or higher than, market cap. Unless, once again, you are expecting massive growth. Companies that have a enterprise value significantly lower than market cap can be possible buyout opportunities.
   * Manageable debt relatively lower than industry peers. (A current ratio above 1 but lower than 5)
   * The company can pay their dividend (see payout ratio)
   * A solid amount of cash on hand.
   * Moderate to high amounts of institutional investment.
   * A solid and growing operating cash flow and operating margin.
   * Increasing YoY Quarterly Revenue Growth and YoY Quarterly EPS Growth.
   * Trading at a value on a pullback of no negative consequence.
   * Solid forward guidance
   * A history of insider confidence through insider buying
   * Solid buy rating analyst coverage and upgrades (Take it with a grain of salt, there are more shitty analysts out there than stars in the sky).
   * Share buybacks are always nice
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Company:** You can never eliminate all the unknowns about the company. But you can ask yourself the following:
   * Is the company at risk for an offering?
   * Can future revenues cover additional debt and reinvestment?
   * What are the chances the company does not preform as expected?
   * How critical will it be for my investment if the company misses EPS projections? Its an important question to ask. Companies underperform EPS all the time amid earnings. More often than not it means the company is still growing, just not at the rate analysts expected. For most profitable companies, missing EPS projections does NOT mean the company isn't profitable. Companies with a positive EPS should typically be better off this quarter on the books than the previous quarter.
   * Is the company's goals realistic and obtainable?
   * Is the company under or over shooting projected guidance?
   * Are analysts under or over shooting guidance?
   * Is the space the company competes in overcrowded?
   * Is the company losing or gaining market share as compared to competitors?
   * Does the company have a competitive advantage or disadvantage?
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Current and Future Economic Conditions:** This can be tough but at minimum you should study current and [upcoming economic datasets](https://tradingeconomics.com/) and ask how a positive or negative change in the various categories affects your company. You will also want to come up with your own short, medium, and long term projection of economic conditions and how they will affect your company. Always pay attention to the [economic calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsubyk/next_weeks_economic_calendar_1115202111222021/)!
   * Inflation Rate (Low is good for preventing dramatic shifts in personal spending, high id good for paying off long term debt)
   * Semiconductor Shortage
   * Worker Shortage (Can they meet demand with the workers they got? If not can they beat previous quarters EPS with the workers they got?)
   * Supply Chain Bottlenecks (Check their domestic inventories as a solid indicator of how affected they are by this)
   * Rising fuel and Energy Costs
   * Rising Shipping Costs
   * Government &amp; Regulatory Environment
   * Federal Reserve Policy
   * Reliance on China and Chinese Economic/Regulatory Environment
   * Unemployment Rate and Labor Force Participation Rate (Too high less people are buying, too low and the cost of labor goes up)
   * Always Pay Close Attention to the [ECONOMIC CALANDER](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsubyk/next_weeks_economic_calendar_1115202111222021/) and the results reported!

# Perspective and Expectation Management Also Mitigates Anxiety:

It's gonna go to the moooooon!!!! No it isn't! Read my part on Big money below to find out why. It's important that you have reasonable expectations. It's important that you have a decent and realistic perspective on the outcome of your trade. Doing this will go leaps and bounds toward mitigating your anxiety.

* **There is NO Such thing as a Perfect Stock:**  If your anxiety is so through the roof that you're forgoing great trades on good companies, cut that shit out! There is no such thing as a perfect stock and you will always need to accept a certain degree of risk!
* **Do not Sweat Minor Misses in EPS:** You're company barely missed analysts EPS or Revenue Expectations? So what!!?? Are they profitable? Are they growing? If they had positive revenue or EPS, chances are they're still growing on the books. Sure their rate of growth may have changed but they're adding money to the balance sheet! It would be one thing if they lowered guidance, but short of that a small EPS miss isn't nothing to frown upon and might put you in the position to buy some more stock for a cheaper price on a really good company! If holding a little longer gives you anxiety then its because you're attempting to get money quick by swinging trades, which is fine, but can add an additional layer of anxiety.
* **Expect the Unexpected and Have a Plan:** Black Swans happen. Major unexpected economic shifts happen. Your dry bulk carrier will catch fire or lose their cargo in the ocean. Oil companies will have spills. Companies get sued all the time. Adjusted economic numbers come out every day of the week. Your stock WILL NOT trade as everyone expects it to. Get used to this and you will mitigate your anxiety. Buy in slowly and have a plan, and you will mitigate it even more.
* **Analysts are Always Wrong:** Firstly it is important to understand that analyst price targets are where the analyst expects the stock to be in a year or so. Not right now. I see a lot of retail traders complaining about the company share price not being at the analyst price target. Its ridiculous expectation management!
* **Understand how Big Money Operates and Expect their Antics!:**  When large institutions dealing in millions to billions of dollars decide to buy or sell a stock, they are well aware that they will inevitably move the share price. The volume they create can be massive. To mitigate this they will either sell calls or buy puts when they sell a considerable lot of shares, or buy calls or sell puts when they buy a considerable lot of shares. Therefore it is important to understand that institutions can often make money no matter which way the stock trades. Unlike most retail traders they even have the option to go both long &amp; short on the same security at the same time. They can, &amp; do, often go short to take advantage of the bearish sentiment they inevitably create while selling large blocks of shares while locking in their profit using a combination of options strategies. Always remember that retail does not own the market  big money does. This reality forces us to come to grips with the necessity not to fight them, but to ride their backs. This includes having the discipline &amp; courage of our convictions to hold through the bearish sentiment institutions inevitably create, on perfectly good companies, when some big firm takes profit. Consider retail traders like ourselves the small Remora Fish attached to a large Great White Shark (The Institutions), waiting to ride their backs out of but a temporary rut of no true consequence.
* **Trading Psychology:** Psychology plays a large part of why stocks can continue to trade below street value. Once a stock sells off due to large institutional profit taking, the street wonders why. Does someone know something we dont? Was there some economic data that cast bearish sentiment on this particular industry or sector? Does the street expect the company to act in a way that will lower its valuation? Such questions, &amp; many more, arent just asked by us. Theyre asked by everyone who holds a position in the company we do. Even analysts may downgrade a stock for no other reason than to tailor their expectations a year out from now. Indeed they hate to be wrong, &amp; they always are. So do not be surprised not only when a security we thought was already undervalued sells off further than expected, but also stays down as it may take time for traders to feel comfortable entering again. Corrections back to street value can often take a few weeks to a few months. Sometimes until next earnings to relive fears of both retail &amp; large institutions.

# Processes Mitigate Anxiety:

Processes mitigate anxiety. The more efficient the process the less time you spend searching for places to put that money that's burning a hole in your pocket. Some traders feel as though they are in a rush to hurry up and strike while the iron is hot and put their money somewhere only to find out that  they rushed their trades and realized a loss. Below is my process and a few additional pointers for researching equities and it mitigates A LOT of my personal trader anxiety.

1. **Assess the Economic Conditions First!:** Assessing the economic conditions first grants you the opportunity to single out those sectors that stand to benefit the most from current and future economic conditions. If you do not know how to do this please see an earlier post I made on this very topic [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qrtkox/understanding_and_profiting_from_our_current/). Also investing in companies that stand to benefit the most from economic conditions gives you an extra layer of confidence to fight anxiety.
2. **Make a Price Based Assessment Watchlist and Set your Alerts:** A Price Based Assessment Watchlist is simply adding companies that you've 1. Assessed the Current or Future Economic Conditions as Favorable. 2. Done a Quick Review of the [Company Financials](https://stocktipstips.substack.com/p/stocktips-investment-research-series). 3. Set your alert at your desired reassessment price. ONLY when that alert hits is when you do the rest of your research and DD. That way you ONLY use your valuable time on the most promising of circumstances. That way you aren't frantically searching and scrolling for plays, but letting the plays come to you, which helps with anxiety!
3. **Buy on a Pullback of Little to No Negative Consequence:** I love a good dump. Perhaps it comes from a bad market day, perhaps it comes from the sector in general doing poorly that day, and perhaps it comes from a whale taking profit. I don't care. If the financials are great, I expect them to grow, and the economic conditions are favorable, such a pullback will trigger my buy alerts letting me know its time for a starter position. But first I do a quick assessment to see if there is any recent negative news that is driving down the share price. If there is negative news, I ask myself to what degree is the news of legitimate financial substance to the growth prospects of the company. If very little, I'll be happy to buy that dip. Some would argue that they want to jump in on solid relative strength. Yeah ... they're chasing and I don't chase. I like it when its cold, not when its hot. Later, when my thesis becomes true, then it gets hot and I watch everyone else chase. But buying on a pullback of little to no consequence will give you that extra layer of value and security you may have been looking for. You wont be worried if the security is over pumped and about to fall, but rather patiently waiting for it to pump again. I think the latter of the two holds less anxiety. More profitable too!
4. **Keep Track of the News:** If you want to monitor your investments stop looking at the chart and read all the news that comes out on your company. Two good places to do this are seeking alpha (Put the ticker in and click the news tab) and, believe it or not, StockTwits! The bots and the news scroller on StockTwits are money! Ignore the people there, read the news scroller! Also set prices you want to review 5% above or below your starter position price and program your broker app to alert you when they hit those points. Its a lot more easy to go about your day that way, and waaay less anxiety when you can be rest assured that at minimum you have lost too much.

Note: Its a long post. Please don't forget to upvote if you like the content. I worked hard on it and I want folks who experience trader anxiety to benefit from my work.

**Overview:** For those of you who consider yourself seasoned traders, ignore this... although I promise you that you will learn something. For those of you who have anxiety issues I think this will prove to be an invaluable resource. I'm going to put a lot of time into writing this and it is directed at those who have high amounts of anxiety while trading in the markets.

# Reddit is an Enabler of Trading Anxiety:

Back in the day I used to post a metric ton of highly detailed DD on Reddit. I posted my research on Reddit for a simple reason ... I wanted feedback ... I wanted to crowdsource my DD. One of the predominant issues I continued to run into was few, if any, added any substantive value in the comment section. I would post DD and 2-4 weeks later I would get a flood of comments of folks who never commented on the thread before, but nevertheless tanked me for all the money they made as a result of reading and taking action on a ticker I wrote about. It was then I noticed that people on Reddit are frequently looking for justification to throw money at anything that may bring them a decent return. As it turned out the information I posted provided that justification. But this was not the reason I posted the research. Once again, I wanted to crowd source DD.

I stopped posting DD on Reddit altogether. It was a lot of work for too little feedback. I can do a complete deep dive &amp; workup on a company in my head with a pad and pencil within an hour. Putting it all together and posting it takes considerably more time. I realized that there is a large segment of people wanted to be told what to invest in with a detailed summary as to why. They generally want to know  the risks, they want to know the possible rewards, and they wanted to know when to buy in, average down, and sell. I therefore opted instead to publish a daily newsletter instead of positing on Reddit.

People on Reddit are buying what they don't understand from people they ought not to trust. A great deal of DD on Reddit only comes about when some poor fella is bag holding deep and suddenly realizes that he/she wants to share the amazing value with the world under a misguided understanding that they may be able to generate undue interest in the stock. DD on Reddit is bag holders paradise. Remember more recently when SNAP, WISH, or PTON dumped on very poor earnings? Did you happen to notice all the DD that was posted days to weeks after? Those were bag holders folks. In part, their anxiety from their losses led them to the desperation of taking to Reddit to pitch trash.

Reddit is a trash heap of poorly written ""DD"" and bad advice. For every solid bit of analysis found on reddit there are thousands of poorly written items that are neither ""due"" nor ""diligent."" How much ""DD"" have you seen posted, for example, with absolutely no consideration for the risk factors? If they're missing a risk section can we honestly say they're being ""diligent"" ... or are they just trying to pump a stock? And there are plenty of new retail traders who have absolutely no clue what they're doing for these fellas to prey on.

There is a reasons so many new retail traders are taking to Reddit for answers. Reddit has received a lot of attention in the media as a result of the GME/AMC fiasco. So new retail traders see Reddit as a place to look for guidance, but instead of guidance, they end up looking for profit in a sea of bad advice. Many are new to the market, they do not know how to read the financials, they do not know how to assess economic conditions, and they do not know how to read/assess (or even find) 10-K's, 10-Q's, 8-K's, earnings calls, etc... They do not know how to value a company, how to identify entry &amp; exit points, how to assess debt,  how to conduct competitive analysis and some even think technical analysis is all you need. They do not know how to assess trailing PE, forward PE, PB, BVPS, PEG, current ratios, PS, Enterprise Value, GAAP EPS, NON GAAP EPS, operating margin, and the list goes on &amp; on &amp; on. And even if they could somewhat do all of this, they don't have the time. So what's the result? ... Massive amounts of confusion, massive amounts of ignorance, and massive amounts of the fear of the unknown.

# Fear of the Unknown is the Number One Reason for Trader Anxiety:

The reason that most of you  suffer from trading anxiety is a lack of confidence in your picks which leads to a great deal of fear of the unknown. And there is only one way to eliminate the fear of the unknown. ELEMINATE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THE UNKNOWN. And if you're are trying to eliminate the unknown through scrolling through insufficient DD posts on reddit, then your anxiety will likely be amplified when you suddenly find out that most of your trades will fail.

# Eliminating the Unknown will Eliminate Anxiety:

Before I retired, I spent 8 years in the Marines as an Infantryman and 13 years in the Army as an intelligence analyst. I've been on the receiving end of information and the production end of information. I've seen the horrible results of bad information, and the absolutely amazing successes in good information. In my experience analysis should overwhelmingly be risk based. Assessing and mitigating risk in my former line of work meant an increased likelihood of mission success, friendly lives saved, and civilian lives saved. The less risk you assess the higher the threat, and therefore, the higher the anxiety. I approach trading in the same fashion. And I know from experience the largest risks come from the unknowns. Learning to identify and spot those unknowns comes largely from experience but you need to begin somewhere. There are 3 types of unknowns.

* **Known Unknows:** These are the items you know you do not know. The overwhelming amount of your effort when assessing an equity is dedicated to filling in the gaps of those items you know you do not know, but would like to know. And much of it is easy to find, but what if you can't? There are many cases in which you would like to know something but the information is not available. In those cases you look for indicators of the information requirements you need to make your case.
* **Unknown Knowns:** These are things you know, but either forgot you knew, or failed to apply it to your analysis. To remedy this you simply need to critically think about what you know and how it applies to your analysis.
* **Unknown Unknowns:** This is perhaps the most dangerous, as it is ALMOST completely derived from ignorance. The more ignorant we are on a certain subject matter the more we run into unknown unknowns. Once you've started on your known knowns, identified your known unknowns (and their indicators), assessed your unknown knowns, you draw your attention to the unknown unknowns. Essentially this is asking ""what the hell am I missing and where can I go to find it,"" or ""where can I look to find the things I do not know I'm missing?""

# Eliminating the Unknown and Mitigating Anxiety:

Investing first and researching later is no way to go about business and it can greatly increase your anxiety! The more you know about your company and the current and future economic conditions, the less anxiety you will have. (Note: Much of the data referenced below can be found under the statics tab of [any given company on Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL).

* **Assessing the Know Knowns:** When you begin your analysis you will always start with assessing what you know. You know, that no matter what company you're looking at, you will generally want the following:
   * A forward PE (Price to Earnings) that is lower than the trailing PE, unless you think the market forward PE consensus is wrong.
   * A PE that is relatively lower than sector/industry peers unless you are expecting massive growth.
   * A BV (Book Value) and BVPS (Book Value Per Share) that is closer to the market cap/share price as possible as compared to industry peers.
   * A PS (Price to Sales) ratio of one or less (ideally less than industry/sector peers) of unless, once again, you're expecting massive future growth.
   * A PEG (Price to Earnings Growth) ratio of one or less unless you are pricing in massive growth (Few if any tech companies have a PEG ratio less than one).
   * An enterprise value that is near, or higher than, market cap. Unless, once again, you are expecting massive growth. Companies that have a enterprise value significantly lower than market cap can be possible buyout opportunities.
   * Manageable debt relatively lower than industry peers. (A current ratio above 1 but lower than 5)
   * The company can pay their dividend (see payout ratio)
   * A solid amount of cash on hand.
   * Moderate to high amounts of institutional investment.
   * A solid and growing operating cash flow and operating margin.
   * Increasing YoY Quarterly Revenue Growth and YoY Quarterly EPS Growth.
   * Trading at a value on a pullback of no negative consequence.
   * Solid forward guidance
   * A history of insider confidence through insider buying
   * Solid buy rating analyst coverage and upgrades (Take it with a grain of salt, there are more shitty analysts out there than stars in the sky).
   * Share buybacks are always nice
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Company:** You can never eliminate all the unknowns about the company. But you can ask yourself the following:
   * Is the company at risk for an offering?
   * Can future revenues cover additional debt and reinvestment?
   * What are the chances the company does not preform as expected?
   * How critical will it be for my investment if the company misses EPS projections? Its an important question to ask. Companies underperform EPS all the time amid earnings. More often than not it means the company is still growing, just not at the rate analysts expected. For most profitable companies, missing EPS projections does NOT mean the company isn't profitable. Companies with a positive EPS should typically be better off this quarter on the books than the previous quarter.
   * Is the company's goals realistic and obtainable?
   * Is the company under or over shooting projected guidance?
   * Are analysts under or over shooting guidance?
   * Is the space the company competes in overcrowded?
   * Is the company losing or gaining market share as compared to competitors?
   * Does the company have a competitive advantage or disadvantage?
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Current and Future Economic Conditions:** This can be tough but at minimum you should study current and [upcoming economic datasets](https://tradingeconomics.com/) and ask how a positive or negative change in the various categories affects your company. You will also want to come up with your own short, medium, and long term projection of economic conditions and how they will affect your company. Always pay attention to the [economic calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsubyk/next_weeks_economic_calendar_1115202111222021/)!
   * Inflation Rate (Low is good for preventing dramatic shifts in personal spending, high id good for paying off long term debt)
   * Semiconductor Shortage
   * Worker Shortage (Can they meet demand with the workers they got? If not can they beat previous quarters EPS with the workers they got?)
   * Supply Chain Bottlenecks (Check their domestic inventories as a solid indicator of how affected they are by this)
   * Rising fuel and Energy Costs
   * Rising Shipping Costs
   * Government &amp; Regulatory Environment
   * Federal Reserve Policy
   * Reliance on China and Chinese Economic/Regulatory Environment
   * Unemployment Rate and Labor Force Participation Rate (Too high less people are buying, too low and the cost of labor goes up)
   * Always Pay Close Attention to the [ECONOMIC CALANDER](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsubyk/next_weeks_economic_calendar_1115202111222021/) and the results reported!

# Perspective and Expectation Management Also Mitigates Anxiety:

It's gonna go to the moooooon!!!! No it isn't! Read my part on Big money below to find out why. It's important that you have reasonable expectations. It's important that you have a decent and realistic perspective on the outcome of your trade. Doing this will go leaps and bounds toward mitigating your anxiety.

* **There is NO Such thing as a Perfect Stock:**  If your anxiety is so through the roof that you're forgoing great trades on good companies, cut that shit out! There is no such thing as a perfect stock and you will always need to accept a certain degree of risk!
* **Do not Sweat Minor Misses in EPS:** You're company barely missed analysts EPS or Revenue Expectations? So what!!?? Are they profitable? Are they growing? If they had positive revenue or EPS, chances are they're still growing on the books. Sure their rate of growth may have changed but they're adding money to the balance sheet! It would be one thing if they lowered guidance, but short of that a small EPS miss isn't nothing to frown upon and might put you in the position to buy some more stock for a cheaper price on a really good company! If holding a little longer gives you anxiety then its because you're attempting to get money quick by swinging trades, which is fine, but can add an additional layer of anxiety.
* **Expect the Unexpected and Have a Plan:** Black Swans happen. Major unexpected economic shifts happen. Your dry bulk carrier will catch fire or lose their cargo in the ocean. Oil companies will have spills. Companies get sued all the time. Adjusted economic numbers come out every day of the week. Your stock WILL NOT trade as everyone expects it to. Get used to this and you will mitigate your anxiety. Buy in slowly and have a plan, and you will mitigate it even more.
* **Analysts are Always Wrong:** Firstly it is important to understand that analyst price targets are where the analyst expects the stock to be in a year or so. Not right now. I see a lot of retail traders complaining about the company share price not being at the analyst price target. Its ridiculous expectation management!
* **Understand how Big Money Operates and Expect their Antics!:**  When large institutions dealing in millions to billions of dollars decide to buy or sell a stock, they are well aware that they will inevitably move the share price. The volume they create can be massive. To mitigate this they will either sell calls or buy puts when they sell a considerable lot of shares, or buy calls or sell puts when they buy a considerable lot of shares. Therefore it is important to understand that institutions can often make money no matter which way the stock trades. Unlike most retail traders they even have the option to go both long &amp; short on the same security at the same time. They can, &amp; do, often go short to take advantage of the bearish sentiment they inevitably create while selling large blocks of shares while locking in their profit using a combination of options strategies. Always remember that retail does not own the market  big money does. This reality forces us to come to grips with the necessity not to fight them, but to ride their backs. This includes having the discipline &amp; courage of our convictions to hold through the bearish sentiment institutions inevitably create, on perfectly good companies, when some big firm takes profit. Consider retail traders like ourselves the small Remora Fish attached to a large Great White Shark (The Institutions), waiting to ride their backs out of but a temporary rut of no true consequence.
* **Trading Psychology:** Psychology plays a large part of why stocks can continue to trade below street value. Once a stock sells off due to large institutional profit taking, the street wonders why. Does someone know something we dont? Was there some economic data that cast bearish sentiment on this particular industry or sector? Does the street expect the company to act in a way that will lower its valuation? Such questions, &amp; many more, arent just asked by us. Theyre asked by everyone who holds a position in the company we do. Even analysts may downgrade a stock for no other reason than to tailor their expectations a year out from now. Indeed they hate to be wrong, &amp; they always are. So do not be surprised not only when a security we thought was already undervalued sells off further than expected, but also stays down as it may take time for traders to feel comfortable entering again. Corrections back to street value can often take a few weeks to a few months. Sometimes until next earnings to relive fears of both retail &amp; large institutions.

# Processes Mitigate Anxiety:

Processes mitigate anxiety. The more efficient the process the less time you spend searching for places to put that money that's burning a hole in your pocket. Some traders feel as though they are in a rush to hurry up and strike while the iron is hot and put their money somewhere only to find out that  they rushed their trades and realized a loss. Below is my process and a few additional pointers for researching equities and it mitigates A LOT of my personal trader anxiety.

1. **Assess the Economic Conditions First!:** Assessing the economic conditions first grants you the opportunity to single out those sectors that stand to benefit the most from current and future economic conditions. If you do not know how to do this please see an earlier post I made on this very topic [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qrtkox/understanding_and_profiting_from_our_current/). Also investing in companies that stand to benefit the most from economic conditions gives you an extra layer of confidence to fight anxiety.
2. **Make a Price Based Assessment Watchlist and Set your Alerts:** A Price Based Assessment Watchlist is simply adding companies that you've 1. Assessed the Current or Future Economic Conditions as Favorable. 2. Done a Quick Review of the [Company Financials](https://stocktipstips.substack.com/p/stocktips-investment-research-series). 3. Set your alert at your desired reassessment price. ONLY when that alert hits is when you do the rest of your research and DD. That way you ONLY use your valuable time on the most promising of circumstances. That way you aren't frantically searching and scrolling for plays, but letting the plays come to you, which helps with anxiety!
3. **Buy on a Pullback of Little to No Negative Consequence:** I love a good dump. Perhaps it comes from a bad market day, perhaps it comes from the sector in general doing poorly that day, and perhaps it comes from a whale taking profit. I don't care. If the financials are great, I expect them to grow, and the economic conditions are favorable, such a pullback will trigger my buy alerts letting me know its time for a starter position. But first I do a quick assessment to see if there is any recent negative news that is driving down the share price. If there is negative news, I ask myself to what degree is the news of legitimate financial substance to the growth prospects of the company. If very little, I'll be happy to buy that dip. Some would argue that they want to jump in on solid relative strength. Yeah ... they're chasing and I don't chase. I like it when its cold, not when its hot. Later, when my thesis becomes true, then it gets hot and I watch everyone else chase. But buying on a pullback of little to no consequence will give you that extra layer of value and security you may have been looking for. You wont be worried if the security is over pumped and about to fall, but rather patiently waiting for it to pump again. I think the latter of the two holds less anxiety. More profitable too!
4. **Keep Track of the News:** If you want to monitor your investments stop looking at the chart and read all the news that comes out on your company. Two good places to do this are seeking alpha (Put the ticker in and click the news tab) and, believe it or not, StockTwits! The bots and the news scroller on StockTwits are money! Ignore the people there, read the news scroller! Also set prices you want to review 5% above or below your starter position price and program your broker app to alert you when they hit those points. Its a lot more easy to go about your day that way, and waaay less anxiety when you can be rest assured that at minimum you have lost too much.

# Anxiety Mitigating Rules to Live by:

Some added anxiety killing tips!

* **If you aren't willing to hold the stock long term, stay away from it!:** So you think you're going to swing it real quick and get out so you don't need to put too much effort into the trade? Think again. The technical analysis guru on YouTube may have a pretty set up, but he's going to throw your anxiety through the roof. And only IF you're lucky, you MAY make a profit.
* **Quit Checking your Phone, Set Alerts Instead:** Set share price points where you want to be alerted and quit checking your phone. I promise you that your anxiety is really going to increase when you're fired from work because you spend too much time checking your investments and too little time getting anything done.
* **Stay Away from Risky Options Strategies:** So you wanted to get rich quick so you bough a bunch of naked calls or puts? All or nothing baby!! Well there goes your anxiety. The more professional you are with options the less anxiety you'll have.
* **Be a Net Options Seller:** Covered calls while you're waiting for your position to turn over long periods of time is a great idea. Its like getting a free dividend and it lowers your cost basis. I've been selling POWW calls for the last three months and in addition to profiting from the increase in share price, I've cashed in $0.56 in premium per share, an 9% gain on the overall position on options premium alone. At this point I don't care how the stock trades. Talk about low anxiety huh? I'll sell calls till the cows come home and if the shareprice on the last day before expiry is slightly over the strike on the calls I sold, pending I want to hold on to the shares I'll just roll the options to another month for additional premium. Furthermore when I can't get a stock for the price I want I often just sell an in the money cash secured put if the options premium is worth it. Lets say a stock is trading for $6.00 but the $7.50 strike put is trading for $2.70. That means the real price to me if assigned is $4.80 per share. Talk about a steal! I'll sell that contract all day every day! And with practically no anxiety.
* **Don't buy in all at once, do NOT chase!:** Don't just throw in a full allocation all at once on a stock. Rather establish a starter position and buy in slowly in the red. This will greatly lower your cost average and increase your profitability. For example, if you established a starter position but now you find yourself down 5%, you can just buy an equally sized position and now you only need the stock to increase 2.5% to recover from your loss. Does this help with your anxiety? You bet it does! Finally, if the stock skyrockets don't chase it. Enjoy the profit and move on. Chasing has been the windowmaker of plenty of traders ... particularly in the penny stock world.
* **Stay away from unprofitable companies and Penny Stocks:** This speaks for itself. I have analyzed a the risk on a bunch of penstocks. And unprofitable companies can often disappoint. Indeed the volatility is there, and there is profit to be made amid volatility. However trust me when I tell you that if you are reading this, it means you likely need help in your trading habits, and you should just stay away from penny stocks and unprofitable companies.
* **BUY RELIABLY RPOFITABLE COMPANIES PRIMED FOR GROWTH, TRADING AT A SECTOR RELATIVE VALUE, ON A PULLBACK OF NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE, WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT, UNDER FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS!:** Swing for grand slams and you'll strike out, or ground out nearly every time. Swing for base hits and you'll hit base hits, home runs, and grand slams on a very regular basis!

# You will NEVER Get Rid of All of your Anxiety:

Its got to be said! You will never get rid of all of your anxiety. You just put a significant amount of cash you worked hard for into shares of a company subject to both positive and negative market forces. There will always be unknowns. Therefore, there will always be anxiety.

**TL;DR:** First, I HIGHLY suggest you read this if you fee that you are the target audience. The thesis above speaks to the fact that anxiety in trading largely comes from the unknown, &amp; the more you mitigate the unknown the less anxiety you will experience. Above there are plenty of steps you can do to mitigate the unknown, thereby developing your confidence, and become a more profitable trader. I also argue that you can mitigate a large portion of your anxiety simply by understanding what you're buying in an equity, understand the markets, understanding trading techniques, developing a sense of perspective, and buying ""*reliably profitable companies, primed for growth, trading a sector relative value, on pullback of little to no negative consequence, with a decent amount of institutional investment, under favorable economic conditions.*"" This post is for people serious about mitigating their anxiety and learnings how to trade in a manner that will benefit both their mental health and their wallets.

more specifically, I made around 20k (30k-&gt;50k) recently, and I want to go on a vegas trip that will cost around 2k. I can't get over the guilt of whether I ""deserve"" it or not. for background, I am a 22yo college student and this is all technically my play money from the initial 5k during covid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtazaw/how_much_profit_to_take_out_and_splurge/

I don't know anything, and not in the jokey retards, apes, dumbass kinda way. I found BRN by accident by typing in random letters in my fidelity app.

Before January 28th BRN traded at basically a dollar, with bit of growth that looks like recovery from their 2020 dip. On the 28th they opened at $1.83, almost hit $7 dollars, and then dropped and closed at $5.76. From there it dropped to basically around the $3 mark and went roughly sideways for the rest of the year. 

Now if you weren't expecting Gamestop to be mentioned at some point in this post then you clearly haven't clocked the kind of person you're dealing with here. I took out a loan to get into Gamestop, which turned out fine but what I'm saying is that I'm a moron. I'm a moron that sees that a completely unrelated stock spiked right in the middle of Gamestop's gamma squeeze in January and then my dumb lizard brain shits out one of those glowing red exclamation points from metal gear solid.

Let's start a bank

https://howtostartanllc.com/business-ideas/bank

It takes between $12-20M in capital to start a bank.

Why don't we start a bank and then we can create money out of thin air and pay off each other's debts?

Think about it.

We can cut out all the useless eater losers from the party and make each of us a debt free baller.

Then we hire our own lobbyists, put our people on the boards of companies, start our own think tanks, etc.

We'll just repeat successful actions and copy what the generationally wealthy do except on a peer-to-peer level.

We just reverse engineer every industry and do it ourselves and cut out the controller freak losers.

If you had no rent/mortgage or car payment, how would that change your life?

Think about it...

Once robotics come online in the near future, many jobs are gone forever and the economy changes forever.

We're either getting Universal Basic Income with slavery strings attached or we steal their idea and do it ourselves.

Our biggest expense is housing, if we all eliminated that monthly bill and put that cash flow towards each other's goals, we are unstoppable.

They couldn't print enough money to stop it.

What does everyone think about this?

Also, please don't make this political or anything else.

Just think from a pure mathematical perspective and a cash flow perspective.

We have the numbers and the power if we stick together.

This is what the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations and all the other ""clubs"" do.

Let's just reverse engineer everything they do and do it peer-to-peer.

If people in here all have businesses we all buy from each other and also help people create their own companies too.

We all are going to use toothbrush, toothpaste, toilet paper, etc as a regular part of our lives, why buy big box brands when we can buy our own stuff?

Keep the money flowing between each other.

I'm sure we have digital marketers in here (I'm one) we can funnel hack Unilever and other companies and if we split our members up via timezones we have 24/7 workforce just taking market share from the big companies and then we can poach their top talent and crowdfund their house (then their salary doesn't matter) and we skull fook these companies into submission.

Think about it...

They can't beat us unless they cheat like Vlad and the hedge funds but then they expose themselves and recruit more people to our team via the Streisand Effect.

1,"11/14/2021, 02:57:44",Is 2030 the best time to sell Tesla? - Analysis of the growth of its production capacity,stiveooo,"Many say they will sell their Tesla shares in 2030, the logic behind this is that in 2030 Tesla will reach maturity like Amazon, Apple and grow at a slower rate (10-30% yoy) so for them whatever price the stock reaches doesn't matter to them, only the year ""2030"".

But is 2030 the best time to sell? Will Tesla yoy growth justify its stock growth?

Tesla doesn't have a demand problem cause it sells every car it makes, so their main problem is their supply capacity.

So this analysys is based on the Utopia principle that Tesla will have enough demand until 2030 and that it will grow at a 40% rate. And that it will be able to build their factories in 12 months without any geopolitical problem and with swift negotiation with the goverments of all the countries. And with the asumption that Tesla suppliers will be able to grow at a similar rate and that all the copper/alum/etc mines will be able to satisfy the demand.

&amp;#x200B;

**Important data**

Elon said that they will search where to build more factories in 2022 and that they will announce the location in 2023.

The calculation is based on the premise that the factories will be built in 12 months and that they will be able to go at max output instantly. Elon said that they will increase their max output of the factories by 50% next year, so in the calculation in the 1st year the factories will have a max output of 500.000 cars and in the next 750.000.

**Result: Supply doesnt meet the demand**

&amp;#x200B;

This shows that in 2030 Tesla wont be able to grow at a 40% rate unless it builds more factories than in this analysis. In the case that Tesla announces a lower number of factories in the next years vs the analysis then their supply wont meet the demand sooner.

In my opinion Tesla is more than capable to built 3-4 factories at the same time, the main problem would be the lack of human resources, regulatory problems like in Germany, negotiation issues, etc, all external problems that Tesla cant do anything about them.

Internal problems like a lack of money for the new factories are not an issue for Tesla. 

One main advantage that Tesla has is that they can make the new factory better than the last one, so in 2030 they could need less factories to meet the demand by making each factory produce close to 1M like they aim to do in Fremont, this would offset any external problem like in Germany.

**And this is where i ask for help: Has any automaker be able to built 5 factories at the same time? or any other industrial company? Apple, BYD?**

In my opinion Tesla is a safe bet until 2025, then we will need to reevaluate it, cause predicting 9 years ahead is just guessing, anything can happen.

**In my opinion BYD is the main threat to Tesla. And Starlink is the main threat to Tesla stocks cause even tesla investors will sell some shares and stop buying to buy Starlink shares when it goes public in 5 years.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qt7odp/is_2030_the_best_time_to_sell_tesla_analysis_of/

I was a retarded ape once, then I got out of my confirmation bias spell when I looked into Adam Aron's shady history. Dude is as nasty as they come, yet apes continually speak of him as a silverback (LOL). From dilutions to selling shares directly to 'hedgies' to now dumping over 53million dollars worth of shares on the apes asses. But 100k is the floor right? 

Any price decrease in AMC shares and you guys start flinging poop at Gary Gensler and Kenny, screeching and screaming about dark pools and short ladder attacks. Going to your sub was enough to make me lose IQ points... How about you stop blaming a 'corrupt' system and introspect a little bit? Why is the share price going down? Perhaps it's because AMC is a failing business and insiders and institutions continually sell. You know, a little bit of thinking outside your box can explain things...   

Look, apes, I'm not here to trash all over your retarded asses. Just here to say it like it is. If you made money, good for you. Continue doing that, but anyone that thinks AMC is a good investment is plain bamboozled. Start looking for better gambles if you're going to throw your money away. I just hope the rug pull doesn't happen and catches you off guard.

The three universals in the e-commerce playbook that ContextLogic Inc. has going for it:

* Low prices (yes)
* Large variety (yes)
* Faster shipping (no) --- to revolutionize shipping, Wish's X factor is the advancement of reusable rockets. Rockets will enable global commerce at an unprecedented level, and it will have vast implications to the current darlings of e-commerce: Amazon, Shopify, Alibaba, etc.

Despite the fact that Wish has been blasted by everyone regarding fake products, 1-2 month shipping, and overall bad quality, the first principles of low prices, large variety, and faster shipping are still existent for this contrarian company based out of SF.

They've been working on product authenticity, reviews, logistics, and improving customer experience. Look at the share prices of Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and other discount retailers. Wish is still in this game. They can pivot to so many domestic models of lowering cost using supply chain innovation, as we have seen from companies like Flexport.

People will keep on saying its products. are fake, low quality, and slow to ship everywhere, but the fundamental strategy of long-term commerce doesn't change.

It's all based on the team and their ability to pivot and execute. I have high hopes for ContextLogic Inc, and I remain bullish. Why? There is a lot of excitement for Wish to prosper in emerging markets and continue to innovate. They have been in the game for a long time.

Team Will Be Able To Execute (Why I'm Bullish On CONTEXT LOGIC),HotAd6989,"# Background: Wish was started by Piotr Szulczewski, a former Google engineer, as a software company called ContextLogic. The Polish-born former Google engineer is obsessed with ordinary folks finances and has used that obsession to tailor an e-commerce marketplace just for them, filled with no-name merchandise shipped directly from merchants around the world.

# ""The Invisible Half""

&gt;We never hypothesized going after value conscious consumers with unbranded goods, but the early data was indisputable. There was a large underserved market of consumers that prioritized price over pretty packaging, fast shipping, and brands. Despite our metrics, we were told repeatedly and at every stage by Menlo Park investors that they didnt know anyone that would shop on Wish. That we were unlikely to surpass whatever sales volume we had at the time. Pointing out that the biggest retailer in America focused strictly on value conscious consumers fell on deaf ears, these investors didnt shop at Walmart either.

# The three universals in the e-commerce playbook that ContextLogic Inc. has going for it:

# Low prices (yes)

# Large variety (yes)

# Faster shipping (no) --- to revolutionize shipping, Wish's X factor is the advancement of reusable rockets. Rockets will enable global commerce at an unprecedented level, and it will have vast implications to the current darlings of e-com: Amazon, Shopify, Alibaba, etc. 

# Despite the fact that Wish has been blasted by everyone regarding fake products, 1-2 month shipping, and overall bad quality, the first principles of low prices, large variety, and faster shipping are still existent for this contrarian company based out of SF. 

They've been working on product authenticity, reviews, logistics, and improving customer experience. Look at the share prices of Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and other discount retailers. Wish is still in this game. They can pivot to so many domestic models of lowering cost using supply chain innovation, as we have seen from companies like Flexport. 

People will keep on saying its products. are fake, low quality, and slow to ship everywhere, but the fundamental strategy of long-term commerce doesn't change. 

# It's all based on the team and their ability to pivot and execute. I have high hopes for ContextLogic Inc, and I remain bullish. 

# Why?  

# There is a lot of excitement for Wish to prosper in emerging markets and continue to innovate. They have been in the game for a long time. 

# They have an engineering-focused leadership, and they can position themselves uniquely using the following principles:

# We are entering the third wave of the internet, where cryptographic currency can enable vending machine-like transactions. 

# Perseverance is a skill that any entrepreneur will have to develop and keep sharp, and Peter is no exception--the first 10 years of Wish were full of hurdles and challenges that required tenacity and patience that ultimately led to an IPO.

# Partnerships were a big part of the Wish strategy from the beginning: they partnered with computer companies, media companies, and advertisers. Peter urges employees to create and / or tap into existing networks of people, companies, and organizations that can be helpful as WISH grows.

# Policy played a huge role in growing Wish internationally. The Wish team is pushing a strategy that is mindful of the role policy plays in business and to get involved when necessary with governmental rulings.

# The seven powers: Scale economics, Network economics, counter-positioning, switching costs, branding, cornered resource, process power ([https://chrisstoneman.medium.com/notes-on-7-powers-foundations-of-business-by-hamilton-helmer-5d20cfecc753](https://chrisstoneman.medium.com/notes-on-7-powers-foundations-of-business-by-hamilton-helmer-5d20cfecc753))

# All of these strategies are available to Wish to consider, and I would like to emphasize the breakdown of the company by its name: 

# CONTEXT: deliveryLOGIC: data

# By focusing on where they can deliver the max volume of goods across the continent USA, I believe that they will be able to sell the top-selling SKUs without horrible shipping times. This can only be possible with subtle strategy changes that harken back to the meaning of CONTEXT LOGIC.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qt5pb8/why_peter_szulczewski_contextlogic_inc_team_will/

I am coming back from a few years break and looking for an european trading platform with low fees and a nice interface; mainly interested in stocks from both old and new world, but I will not turn away from cryptocurrencies and materials.
I opened an account on trading212, I also looked at etoro, plus500, degiro, interactive brokers.
I wonder if you could recommend something to me (and to others looking for an investment platform). I think I may want to invest around 10k  in the future.

I understand that trading212 makes money from spreads and share borrowing and that's not ideal. The other problem is if you want to calculate taxes easily (my country currency isn't $ or ) and decide to have an account in other than EUR or USD currency, then the currency conversion fees for buying shares are 0.15% of the purchase amount.

The last 5 quarters have all seen growth over 3%. This is the longest such streak in history. 

The last 5 quarters have seen a price increase of over 23%. This is the biggest such increase in history (back as far as tracked data goes). 

The same markets that went wild in 2003-2008 are the same markets than have gone wild in 2020-2021. Inflation is nowhere near the levels we saw the last time prices moved this quickly. A ~1% drop in mortgage interest rates improves affordability by about 11%. This really cant be used as justification for home values at this point. National supply has more or less corrected as well. 

I scratch my head when people say Real Estate only goes up considering just before the pandemic prices were stagnant. Over 5 years from 2015-2020 the median new home sale went from 289k to 322k. Its gone from 322k to 405k in the last 5 quarters.

Edit: Another point I'd like to add. People say RE pretty much never goes down. Across 234 quarters there were 68 that yielded negative growth (29%). There were 5 quarters (about 2%) that yielded -5% or more results.

Revenue in the third quarter totaled $228 million, an increase of 124% compared to the third quarter of 2020, well exceeding our guidance of $125 million to $150 million. Billable tests in the quarter totaled almost $2.2 million, more than twice the volume of Q3 last year. Breaking down the revenue a bit further, roughly $188 million came from COVID PCR testing, which exceeded our guidance by approximately $100 million and grew 105% year over year, while roughly $40 million came from our core business, which exceeded our guidance of $32 million and grew approximately 300% year over year.

While demand for COVID testing remains extremely volatile, we remain well-positioned to capture this demand if and when it fluctuates higher, which we saw in the third quarter a reversal relative to the slowdown we saw in the second quarter. We have continued to take a conservative stance on any expected revenue from COVID testing given the inherent challenges in predicting COVID spikes or the emergence of other variants. We remain focused on executing on our post-COVID growth opportunities, which include expanding the reach of CSI's capabilities, working with Helio on our joint commercialization opportunities, growing on the footprint on our China operations and launching new initiatives such as the only partnership Brandon discussed.

On top of this, VW who is also a QNX partner has been increasing sales of it's EV unit in China over the passed couple of months.

The company also said that , Earlier this fall, BlackBerry also released a product demonstration of solutions powered by BlackBerry IVY, focusing on electrification use cases. This demo has been shown to several automotive customers and partners.

These key driving forces will increase the FCF and the adoption of QNX for automotive platform and security assets. The adoption of the systems is a matter of national security.

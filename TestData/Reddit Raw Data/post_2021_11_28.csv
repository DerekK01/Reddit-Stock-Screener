1,"11/28/2021, 23:07:29",Your options don't have to have decay!,Market_Madness,"#**Introduction**
The best part about trading options is that you can leverage any stock you want, in any direction you want. The worst part about options trading is that their value decays over time and they have an expiration date. The ZEBRA  strategy is a spread that allows you to keep most of the leverage and remove the decay. I'll give a very beginner level explanation of what the strategy is, how to set it up, and why it is able to effectively remove the decay from your options. 

#**Intrinsic And Extrinsic Value Refresher**
If you understand the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic value you may skip to the next section. Options always have both intrinsic value and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is real value, value that you could redeem right now if you executed the contract. If you have a call on Intel with a strike price of $30 and Intel is trading at $45 then this call already has $15 (* 100) worth of real value. This is because you could execute your contract, buy your 100 shares for $30, and then turn around and sell them for $45. When you buy an option where the strike price is lower than the current price this value is going to be priced into the option. This is its intrinsic value. The rest of the value of an option is extrinsic value, that's basically the cost of the uncertainty/potential of the contract going forward. If Intel is trading at $45 and you buy a call with a strike price of $45 this has no real value, but because it very easily could have real value in the future you need to pay for that chance. However, if you buy a $100 call on Intel this is unlikely to happen, so it's not worth very much. The closer the option's strike price is to the real price the more extrinsic value there will be. 

#**Delta Refresher**
If you understand what the concept of delta is and where to find it within your brokerage you may skip to the next section. Every option contract has multiple significant values called ""the greeks"" that explain its behavior. I'm only going to be using delta for this strategy, and only one part of it. Delta ranges from 0 to 1 for calls and 0 to -1 for puts. A call with an At The Money (ATM) strike price, where the current price and the strike price are almost the same, will often have a delta near 0.50 (often just called 50). A call with a strike price much lower than the current price is called In The Money (ITM), and will usually have a delta between 0.5 and 1. Lastly a call with a strike price much higher than the current price is called Out Of The money (OTM) and will usually have a delta between 0.5 and 0. What does this value mean though? 

#**Setting Up The Strategy**
Delta has a lot of different meanings and uses, but for the purposes of this strategy you only need to realize that the delta value is a rough approximation of the number of shares that option will be representing. A 50 (0.5) delta call will be moving with the power of about 50 shares of the underlying stock. **If you want to effectively remove decay from your options here's what you do.** 

 * Pick the stock or index you want to add leverage to
 * Pick if you are bullish or bearish on that ticker
 * Pick how much time you want for this spread to play out (&gt; 1 year is suggested)
 * Purchase two 70 (0.7) delta calls (if bullish) or two -70 (-0.7) puts (if bearish)
 * Write (sell) one 50 (0.5) delta call (if bullish) or one -50 (-0.5) put (if bearish)

This is going to result in a payout chart that looks very very similar to if you were owning the stock, but with some leverage and an expiration date.

#**Why Does This Work?**
The two ITM calls (where extrinsic value is relatively low and real value is relatively high) provide you with a lot of real value and little extrinsic value. When you turn around and sell the ATM call (where extrinsic value is very high and intrinsic value is zero) you are making it so that the high extrinsic value of this call matches the combined extrinsic value of the two ITM calls. If you buy $100 worth of extrinsic value and then sell $100 worth of extrinsic value you won't have any left. If you have no extrinsic value you have no decay. This means that while the calls still have an expiration date, they do not decay in value. If our Intel calls from earlier go up even 1% you will profit to some degree and because you have one call without a sold counterparty your potential profit is technically infinite, just like with stock, but unlike many other spreads. 

#**Conclusion**
This strategy is perfect if you want to leverage something without relying on a large price increase or decrease to reach your breakeven point. It's still highly dangerous because if the ticker does not move your way you will still lose all of the money you invested if you didn't cut your losses at some point. This should be used a small part of your portfolio on something you have reason to be very bullish or very bearish on to amplify potential returns.

#**TLDR**
Buy two 70 delta calls, sell one 50 delta call, enjoy decay-free calls on stupid shit   ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r46b59/your_options_dont_have_to_have_decay/

**TL;DR.**   
*On the variant itself* \- it is highly transmissible (\~500% more than the virus originating from Wuhan), a small sample size suggests it is less severe.  Immunity escape and vaccine avoidance are unknown.  See link below for details on the above, mutations and actual case counts.  


*Latest News* \- Israel has shut its borders for 2 weeks, India has stated they may restrict international travel, CDC states there are no USA cases.  


*Positive Information, Path forward and an opinion on the markets:*

1. 1421 days: much more information will be available about the mutations (especially the unknown ones). We will also have more information on severity.
2. 50 to 100 days: IF the variant escapes vaccines it will take about 6 weeks to release an updated vaccine (this is because in the case of vaccine updates a limited trial of just 24 people is required). Estimate is 50 to 100 days to having the vaccine available.

My personal opinion: if the markets are truly forward looking and we estimate that a highly transmissible, less severe disease may have some resolution in 100 days then the market should correct its recent downtrend (will have to analyze flows tonight).

According to this page ([https://www.basic-fit.com/nl-be/all-in](https://www.basic-fit.com/nl-be/all-in)) they are introducing a plan-based scheme that lets you buy a bike (yes, your own), membership and whatever other things they offer for about half the price. Absolutely stunning company.

1,"11/28/2021, 20:28:53",Opinion of Omicron from a lab tech.,BurritoBurglar9000,"Just going to put this out there, and not as a doomer or anything, but omicron has probably spread everywhere and not just 1 of 2 cases here and there. It's been running around probably for several weeks and we just now know what we're looking for. It's popped up in 3 different continents outside Africa in the four-ish days since it was publicly announced so you can safely say these new cases are not the first.

I'm not saying it'll get as bad as delta, but you can bet your already fisted asses that governments are going to impose a shitload of overreactive (potentially who knows right now) restrictions.

Very bullish for covid stonks. Dow might continue to shit the bed and drag spy with it, but ol' nassy should bounce.

By the by, I'm not an epidemiologist, but I do covid testing in a hospital so i do have some actual knowledge in the area. It is really fucking hard to track variants because most people who walk through our doors that get tested never have samples sent to the state. If it's positive we do 0 further investigation and I've worked in several facilities in the country who follow the same protocol. Most of the cost efficient and widely used tests (see Abbott Id now) don't go any further than testing for all variants and it would be really impractical to go further and send every positive sample out. 

Early covid we had to send samples to the state labs or ref labs and it would take 8 to 10 days to get results back. We won't run into this issue specifically again, but if we were to send out every positive sample for specific genotyping would likely develop a decent backlog. After a certain period it does very little good because by the time we know we need to do contact tracing it's already spread once, maybe twice depending on how backlogged they get. Not to mention that biotech companies would have to design and manufacture en mass the kits to do it. The lag there would put us in the middle of a wave if this thing really ramps up. Now it is easy to design new pcr primers, but again you still need them in bulk and it's really tough to do it in a high throughput capacity because it actually takes skilled labor which we are really, really short on.

Tl;Dr it very likely in multiple states and we will see it pop up widely in a couple weeks if it spreads as fast or faster than delta. It's hard to track properly and there will be a shitload of fear-mongering and knee jerk reactions.

Seriously, I'm having a hard time to consider the possible outcome following Omicron.

Based on how bad the market behaved and how panic ensued throughout the world, one could think that this is going to be bad again and we might enter a similar phase to what happened in early 2021 when delta hit.

At the same time... I feel that the market seriously overreacted and since I'm an ape I'd definitely buy the fckn dip even if it's only the top of it.

Seriously though, we got vaccines, we actually don't know how bad this variant is and if it's really actually bad, we begin to develop cures and pills against the virus for hospitalized people, and so far we haven't reached the same levels we had back when there was delta and full lockdowns. 

I feel like hospitality/accomodation and tourism in general could suffer, but I don't see how we could return to the worst moments we had in the crisis. I see this as an incredible opportunity to buy. Not to mention that Chief Powell is back on track for the printing.

For this guide, I will be using PLTR because it is my largest (and only) holding, but you can feel free to use whatever stock you so choose.

**Step 1: Adjust your thoughts to remove bearish undertones.**

Instead of saying: ""PLTR has gone down so much in the past two weeks, I'm now questioning my life choices and want to cry.""

Say: ""PLTR has been volatile.""

By replacing any bearish thought with the word ""volatile"" you are still technically correct with respect to the price movement, but you're ignoring the price direction. The news frequently does this when they try to sell you garbage companies that are based in China.

**Step 2: Compare your stock to the market only when it benefits you.** 

For example, PLTR closed down 0.4% on Friday. I could say, ""PLTR was down on Friday."" However, SPY was also down 2.27% on the same day. 

Thus, a better statement is ""PLTR beat the market.""

**Step 3: Manufacture a gain by looking at a stock at specific times during the day.**

Example: PLTR was down over 4% this morning in pre-market on Friday. But as the market opened it was down 3%. Thus, you could make the argument that PLTR had a 1% gain in the pre-market.

&amp;#x200B;

And the best part is you can use any one of these three strategies to turn your fear of losing money into actual realized losses. Anyone can do it (and most of is do)! 

Have a nice weekend everyone.

Position: January 2023 $15 calls.

2. Reports are in, that retail buy orders did not go through during regular trading hours on black friday (which happened to be the worst black friday for the Dow Jones since 1931)

3. Citadel curiously stopped after hours trading on GME at 3:37pm EST

4. Reports are in, that retail orders were delayed until monday

5. Because of B.1.1.529 (otherwise known as the 'horrific' killer Omicron virus strain) NSCC's capital requirements for margin (due to value-at-risk and EVWMA volatility coefficients increasing) just went up, while value of other collateral went down (across the board assets), thereby causing margin calls for funds holding outsized short positions on GME stock.  This is verified by twitter reports of pending short-position liquidations based on failures to satisfy these margin calls.

6. Last time the VIX jumped to these levels was January 26th, the day before the GME squeeze

7. Friday's close put GME at a 4 week TTM squeezer indicator on the weekly

8. Gamestop's app (from the appstore) just jumped to top 30 from 68

9. Loopring's SDK complete and L2 Wallet complete. Waiting on Fiat payment processor to confirm.  (liftoff imminent)

But here are 5 reasons why you need to make the switch to WBroker today;
WBroker offers commissions free stock trading. This means your profits are safe from being eaten up by trading fees.
The customer care service you get while using WBroker is top notch. Your queries and questions are a phone call away from being resolved
Your assets are secure with WBroker, as your assets are held by a third party, and your account is subject to supervision by FMA.
The deposits and withdrawals speed available on WBroker is arguably the best around
They have a front-to-end risk control which protects the investor by screening off high risk stocks and restricting high risks trading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r3itfz/5_reasons_why_you_should_switch_to_wbroker/

-Pie mixes

-Some fruit (pumpkin, rhubarb, apples, key lime)


Pies will likely become a political issue like masks, and congressmen and women will tweet about the oppression and atrocities of pies.

So, we can prepare to short pies.

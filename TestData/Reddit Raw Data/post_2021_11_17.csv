ROOT

Company shares the evolution of its workspace experience

-a leading technology company powering insurance solutions and the parent company of Root Insurance, today shares the companys work where it works best philosophy, and the future of work at Root.

After more than a year of widespread uncertainty and ambiguity for employees and companies everywhere, Root has launched a new way of working that empowers employees to determine what works best on an individual level while providing clarity for the future.                   -The companys work where it works best philosophy focuses on the what, who, and why of work, not the where. With this philosophy, Root will continue to remain headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, and is currently evaluating office space in regional hubs based on employee feedback.

At Root, people are at the center of our companys culture, and we bring that to life by giving them both voice and choice in where and how they work, says Roots Chief People Officer Michele Streitmatter. We know our employees want and need more flexibility around how they live and work, and we are committed to continuing to learn and grow together as an organization.                                              -Since March 2020, Roots employees have been working remotely to prioritize safety, first and foremost. As a digital-first company, Root has the unique ability to remain nimble and empower a distributed workforce with proven productivity and collaboration.

In an effort to provide certainty and clarity in an increasingly confusing world, leaders recently began to look to the future. They recognized an incredible opportunity to be thoughtful about what the evolution of work looks like at Root by engaging in open conversations with employees.

Through those conversations between leaders and their teams, the company has learned that many employees would like to return to the office when it is safe to do so. Theyve also discovered that work and home life have new meanings, and many employees need the flexibility to work from home.

Weve learned that flexibility only enhances employees work product, in no way taking away from it, says Streitmatter. This new way of working allows everyone to focus on what's most criticalthe what, who, and why of work, not the where.

An evolution of the workspace

For those employees who choose to come into an office or for whom the nature of their role requires in-office work, the company realized the future of the workspace looks different, and, so, set out to provide a more inclusive strategy.

Team input will help the company understand space planning needs. When its safe to return, offices will have collaboration spaces, quiet zones, and social spaces. Employees who work from an office will have a dedicated space thats socially distanced, ensuring the company continues to meet all state and local restrictions, mandates, and guidelines as they are in place.

The Root Facilities team has now evolved into the Workspace Experience team and is focused on delivering a holistic approach for all employees, whether that be a distributed solution or in the office. The team will remain committed to driving fundamental change across every aspect of the way the company works, including addressing physical and mental well-being, workspace efficiency, and technology.

How we think about the office has forever changed, and were incredibly energized by the opportunities we now have to enable a shared work experience regardless of where our employees are, says Streitmatter.

As a company committed to providing fairer insurance for our customers, its core to Roots mission to provide employees with that same fairness. Allowing employees to bring their full selves to work, and to share their voices and choices, is at the foundation of Roots culture..

[Tuesday Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvb16q/goev_the_tuesday_update_were_on_track/)

Morning, apes!

As we have all noticed, a lot of eyes are on GOEV this week.  Yesterday we traded 19.5 Million shares, about two slow weeks worth of trading.  The fact that we went mostly sideways is the result of millions of new shares being shorted into the market.  You don't sell a long-term-hold on good news when it moves a few %.  This is not appropriate investor behavior for what this stock represents.

Lots of contract action yesterday, we now have 3.7 million shares ITM and even bigger break points at 12.50 and 15.  Our peak is now 7.2 million shares, up one million from the beginning of the week.  The short attacks will keep coming, we have to keep buying.

&amp;#x200B;

When the next short data comes through I expect the short amount to be over 50M shares, they are flooding the market to keep this below specific break points.  On the upside, investors see the bull case and are eating up shares every time the shorts try to push it down.

**We broke 12 in after hours and 13 in pre-market, investors like the stock.**

Keep buying shares and be prepared for this fight to roll over into next week.  This is a $16 stock today, $35 end of next year, $100 in 2024.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvdrtu/canoo\_walmart\_hints\_speculation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvdrtu/canoo_walmart_hints_speculation/)

&amp;#x200B;

Today I wanted to give some additional info on why I think this partnership is very likely to happen. Basically, it seems like all of the other companies headquartered in Bentonville have a partnership with Walmart already and it seems like common practice for Walmart to encourage their suppliers to move to the city. Take for example JB Hunt, a logistics carrier located in Benton county, that has had a &gt;30 year relationship with Walmart. [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160412005327/en/Walmart-Names-J.B.-Hunt-Transport-Services-Inc.-the-2015-Intermodal-Carrier-of-the-Year](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160412005327/en/Walmart-Names-J.B.-Hunt-Transport-Services-Inc.-the-2015-Intermodal-Carrier-of-the-Year)

&amp;#x200B;

When looking into this phenomenon further, I found a very telling article about how development happens in Bentonville. Here are some of the more interesting snippets:

""For the next seventy years, the development of Bentonville and the larger NWA region was tied directly to being Walmarts headquarters. Suppliers and business service firms seeking to do business with Walmart were required to migrate to the hinterlands of upper South Arkansas as a prerequisite for contracting with the company.""

""The Waltons have deployed their charitable foundation to exploit Bentonvilles willingness to trade democratic control over planning and decision-making for access to Walton capital.""

""Bentonvilles transformation is dependent upon a supposedly nonmarket actor, the Walton Family Foundation, working like a parallel state, to set development priorities, organize the logistics to realize these projects, and assemble the capital to subsidize it all."" [https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/03/walmart-walton-family-foundation-bentonville-arkansas-company-town](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/03/walmart-walton-family-foundation-bentonville-arkansas-company-town)

&amp;#x200B;

Theres more detail in the article, but the gist of it is that according to this article Walmart asks their suppliers to locate next to them and they have assumed control of regional planning through process and capital so that they control what gets developed. It sounds like Canoo does not get into Bentonville unless they were explicitly invited",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw1kee/heres_why_i_think_walmart_goev_will_announce_a/

1,"11/17/2021, 23:12:31",$OPAD &amp; $OPEN - Ibuyers Ready to roll higher after NOV.30? - Higher Mortgage Limits Will Push the Home Prices Even Higher and Infrastructure Bill Will Make New Homes Even More Expensive,invest_opinions,"There was to different stories that are leading to one winner. 

Well, actually 2 $OPAD and $OPEN, but $OPAD grows faster and have a better price. 

**What Happened ?** 

So, beginning of Nov., Zillow ($ZG)  announced its exit from Ibuying business. The news initially sent down also the other 2 main competitors Opendoor (OPEN) and Offerpad (OPAD) as the main idea suggested by Zillow management was that Ibuying is not working. 

Opendoor and Offerpad had stellar earnings, record revenues and also lifted their 2021 projections, settings things straight.

But there is more to it:  

1. Zillow announced that it would sell the home bought until now and that creates practically a sale season for the homes it already bought.

2. Even more importantly - Why Zillow failed in Ibuying? They bought fast and overpriced. With out their overpricing, the prices payed by the Ibuyers will naturally get lower as there are not anymore better offers in the market. 

This 2 points lead to one conclusion: a lot of houses bought at a cheaper price by $OPAD and $OPEN. How many? we can't now for sure but next earnings will certainly show a boost in acquisitions. 

**So OPEN and OPAD own a lot more houses right now.** 

**WHY is that Important?** 

All this boost in inventory is risky when you don't know where the prices will go. Right? 

But we do now! 

Here comes the second story: Nov. 30 is the date when the Gov Backed mortgages get their maximum limit published.  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac will Back Home Loans of Nearly $1 Million in certain areas   (for 820K previous limit) and for all other/cheaper markets the limit is boosted from  ***$548,250***  to $**650,000**. **That is almost 20% increase. That means much more houses will qualify for a gov. backed mortgage.** 

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/federal-government-backing-appears-set-to-be-extended-to-home-loans-of-nearly-1-million-11637077164?reflink=MW\_GoogleNews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/federal-government-backing-appears-set-to-be-extended-to-home-loans-of-nearly-1-million-11637077164?reflink=MW_GoogleNews)

**Also that 20% spike in mortgage limits shows the real inflation in home pricing expected by Fed. Gov.** 

Conclusion: **ALL** **Houses are getting much expensive in 2022.** 

Hey, but building permits have soared so there will be many more homes built driving the prices lower. It usually works like, right? 

NOT this time. 

Infrastructure Bill will push some 200B+ in construction. **That is 200B competing against the house builders.** 

**Us has a free market so more billions hunting for constructors, cement, rock, sand, land etc. will push the cost of building new houses to the skies.**

What that means also? - **Old houses will get another boost in price.** 

By last account,  $Zillow, $OPEN and $OPAD had penetrated less than 12% of the real estate trades. That was before Zillow went out of Ibuying. Now there are only 2 main competitors in all this market.

**WHY $OPAD is cheaper than $OPEN**

Simple math - with similar synergies (they use internal resources for fixing - lowering costs, they use real estate experts+ AI to get the best price at buying, etc.) OPEN has 13.6B markeyt value at 2.2B revenue while OPAD has a 1.98B market value at 550M revenue.

Ether $OPAD should be $12-$13 right now or OPEN should be cheaper.

**Thing is they will both get a lot more expensive because they will ingest a lot more value in 2021 -2022.**

1,"11/17/2021, 22:45:55",Trading Signals Work,VeronicaSale," **You really don't believe trading signals work?**  
I have worked in multiple companies that provide customers with their buy/sell calls. After years of experience at work and on Reddit, I have noticed a common misconception that most people have. They believe

&gt;that a trading signals company is just a random person sitting behind a computer throwing out random guesses.

**If you believe that you are wrong.**  
Should you be paying for a signals company?  
To understand if signals are the right thing for you, answer the following questions.

* Do you have 8 hourrs a day to spend on research?
* Do you prefer to trust your own experience, knowledge and capabilities rather then tens of employees?
* Do you own or would you like to pay for high-quality AI tracking tools
* Do you understand that you will also be making a guess at the end of the day.

**Is purchasing signals equivalent to a magic ball?**  
It would depend on the company. It is your responsibility to research the company and determine if you believe in them. It's equivalent to hiring a specialist doctor. Are you positive that the doctor can help? No but statistically he is more likely to be right then you. You definitely shouldn't hire a doctor, if you are sketched out by them. Well,**SUPRISE**,*don't go with a sketchy company either.*  
In reality you are left with 3 options.

1. Spend time researching and then take your own best guess.
2. Go with your gut and pray.
3. Find a reputable trading signals company.

**Do trading signals work?**  
*Honestly,* **yes.**  
Working in a trading signals company means all day you work with the stock market. Not just you but dozens of co-workers. All aiming to create the best service for you, the consumer.**No one can actually predict the stock market,**so they will get the wrong calls. That being said some**do better then others.**  
How can you be sure that it is a safe bet?  
If you finda signal company that looks reputable, but you still want to make sure its a safe investments.

Goodmorning traders, do you like two-sided trade? I know I like two-sided trade especially on an expansive range. We should see some more of it the next couple of days. Now that we have the weekly chart in the overbought condition, we should see other timeframes go thru the treadmill effect. The treadmill effect is where you see the cycling over of multiple timeframes over the same range at a faster pace. To witness this just pull up your favorite market strength oscillator. 

Also remember that we are rangebound between 472 down to 461 and vix wont show any real pop or excitement until we break that range 

Today'sscenarios... 

Key reversal levels to watch are 469,470area then 468, 465area.

1) Range day structure. Establish range high around 469 low 470 area. Then feeling out a range low around 468 area and possibly pushing the boundaries lower or higher at some point. **35% probability**

2)Trangeday (rounded reversal) wetake off from 469 area not looking back until we get to the midday chop area of 466-465 area. After a sideways move we look for a move back towards 469.**34% probability**

3)Trend day down. We find resistance before yesterdays close of 469.28. We reverse and start a trend down morning session toward 467(dont be surprised if we over shot thetarget area). We find our midday chop along the way where we chop sideways before going into a minor pullback before resuming the major trend of the day.**31% probability**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvzpjl/forward_looking_and_range_bound_111721_premarket/

# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowes and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowes.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.
*****
&gt; Home improvement giant Lowes got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.
*****
&gt; Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.
*****
&gt; Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace companys stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.
*****
&gt; Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.
*****
&gt; On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.
*****
&gt; The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.
*****
&gt; The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.
*****
&gt; Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.
*****
&gt; Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.
*****
&gt; US stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.
*****
&gt; Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath &amp; Body Works and Victorias Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.

**TORONTO, Nov. 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Revive Therapeutics Ltd. (Revive or the Company) (OTCQB: RVVTF) (CSE: RVV) (FRANKFURT: 31R), a specialty life sciences company focused on the research and development of therapeutics for medical needs and rare disorders, announced today a research study, titled Thiol drugs decrease SARS-CoV-2 lung injury in vivo and disrupt SARS-CoV-2 spike complex binding to ACE2 in vitro from the University of California, San Francisco,showing that potent thiol drugs, like Bucillamine, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, specifically the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), which is now globally dominant, and also reducing SARS-CoV-2-related lung injury in vivo and providing strong rationale for trials of systemically delivered thiol drugs as COVID-19 treatments.In addition to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could limit lung injury in COVID-19, thiol drugs have promising antiviral effects.**  


**The Company is currently exploring oral Bucillamine in a Phase 3 clinical study to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and based on the published paper and the University work, the Company will also seek to develop a reformulated version of Bucillamine as a potential treatment for severe COVID-19 disease and related infectious diseases.**

**We are excited to see another published paper supporting potent thiol drugs, like Bucillamine, for COVID-19, including the Delta variant, as we continue in our Phase 3 clinical study with Bucillamine to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We are also gathering new scientific evidence to support Bucillamines potential for severe COVID-19, said Michael Frank, CEO of the Company.**

Let's say they eventually sell as many cars as Toyota (400b Market cap), their current valuation is still 2x this, and they aren't even close to Toyota's production level and probably won't be for the next 5+ years. 

Toyota's production for 2021: 10 million cars

Guys,

Lets take a look at Chegg (CHGG) recently stock crashed by over 50% price for slight revenue miss but beat EPS from its Q3 earnings. Great potential, oversold stock with RSI standing at 18 as of today. Main reason for stock crash catalyst is that college enrollment is down temporarily. Todays stock price is at pre pandemic level (52week high price was $113 and today's price is $29.69 lowest in 4yrs or so).

Should we buy this stock as it has potential for short squeeze and has great potential IMO. Price target by over 12 analyst is average $55 ($38 low to $100 high) currently stock is trading at $29.69. I bought 214 buy calls for $30 expiring on April 22 although Im down by over $20000 still holding and will continue holding and buying more in foreseable future.

&amp;#x200B;

[My options position](https://preview.redd.it/735apypr55081.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e81c7e4d21e8f592a50a0c8e80d2311eeaffcef)

 

Lots of hedge funds are adding more shares of Chegg and a quote from analyst research "" Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) was in 38 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 45. CHGG has seen an increase in hedge fund interest recently. There were 33 hedge funds in with CHGG holdings at the end of March. ""

Dec , relaunch

**DMYQ - Planet.com - Niccolo de Masi**

\- Niccolo de Masi brought is GENI, RSI Rush street, IONQ quantum computing that just merged 3 weeks ago that went from 10-28$. **Now Niccolo DMYQ merges in 3 weeks.**

With that said I am here to discuss DMYQ or Planet.com or should have been named GoogleMaps, If googlemaps merged with a SPAC everyone would load the boat. But what people do not know is googlemaps and google buy all their map data from DMYQ Planet.com. About 3 years ago google sold all their satellites to planet and bought at 10% of the company, blackrock also invested in planet too.

Planet is about ten year ahead of all the competition and provides global, daily satellite imagery and data is used to help with all sectors. Counties and companies now sue this data for global warning, , population, fire, floods, farms, shipping routes and really ANYTHING. They basically capture the earth twice a day with 25T of information. Planet is a information company, and the satellites pay themselves off within 3 months. They have a 5 year deal with SpaceX to send hundreds of additional satellites to space and just got the NRO contract with US GOV (google NRO) and over 700 contract around the word. Growing at 40% a year for next 5 years, thats existing customers.

I just have not seen a better SPAC to invest in early, but please your thought, if I should buy or maybe I am wrong and should just invest in a donut shop?

1,"11/17/2021, 18:57:27",Chegg (CHGG) over sold and under valued,maverick5675," 

Guys,

Lets take a look at Chegg (CHGG) recently stock crashed by over 50% price for slight  revenue miss but beat EPS from its Q3 earnings. Great potential, oversold stock with RSI standing at 18 as of today. Main reason for stock crash catalyst is that college enrollment is down temporarily. Todays stock price is at pre pandemic level (52week high price was $113 and today's price is $29.69 lowest in 4yrs or so).

Should we buy this stock as it supports education and has great potential IMO. Price target by over 12 analyst is average $55 ($38 low to $100 high) currently stock is trading at $29.69. I bought 214 buy calls for $30 expiring on April 22 although Im down by over $20000 still holding and will continue holding and buying more in foreseable future.

&amp;#x200B;

[My options calls](https://preview.redd.it/1qe0bscvz4081.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96020bf8d37442cc063aec4c5c64c05814f5b49a)

Lots of hedge funds are adding more shares of Chegg and a quote from analyst research "" Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) was in 38 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 45. CHGG has seen an increase in hedge fund interest recently. There were 33 hedge funds in with CHGG holdings at the end of March. ""

On RH, I was able to buy a call options that expired in December, and then I shorted a call option on the same strike price but expiring Nov 19. Then, I again bought  another call option expiring in Dec, and then using that call as collateral, I bought another call with the same strike price but expiring Nov 19. 

The shorted calls are extremely unrealistic as the strike price is much higher than the actual price, so most likely I will profit on the shorted calls. 

Am I missing something here? Or can I rinse and repeat this as much as I want? I understand that shorting calls can lead to unlimited losses, and anything can happen, but assuming the shorted calls *do* expire worthless, can I keep this going to net a huge gain? I don't want to hear that 1 out of every 20 shorted calls that are deep OTM *can* end up ATM or ITM, resulting in a massive loss. I'm curious if I can keep this going, and assuming the shorts expire worthless, will I net a huge gain? Or am I missing something here?

1,"11/17/2021, 14:40:38",Nucor for domestic steel production?,sidpost,"I am looking for domestic production of infrastructure-related products that will stand up to an inflationary environment. This will also help deal with currency exchange rate swings and global shipping problems. With inflation picking up, I see the dollar getting weak which makes foreign-produced products more expensive, hence my desire to find domestic sources of production. With the ports backed up, this should also provide an advantage since the steel can be shipped domestically without commercial port needs.

I'm looking specifically at Nucor Corp for a possible addition to my IRA. What other domestic USA-based steel producers should I consider? I am open to comments on related products like concrete and infrastructure construction equipment. I should note I don't want much if any, foreign content due to global shipping concerns and exchange rate swings expected due to inflation and a weaker dollar.

The question is: if you sell an asset for market value (with a overall return on investment), and the asset continues to increase further in value over time - after your closing trade - would you consider your decision to sell to be a mistake?

1. Defencath is novel drug product that targets fungal and bacterial infections from catheter-blood stream infections. It is primarily for people who are at the end stages of renal disease receiving blood hemodailysis via a catheter. It is on the FDAs fast track status and  is on a qualified infectious disease product which guarantees exclusivity for 5 years upon approval. The company submitted the NDA last year and thats why the stock shot up to 10 dollars and right before rejection it was at 17.00 per share.
2. Its important to note that the drug was not rejected on the basis of its science. The drug was so effective at preventing blood stream infections at .0006 rate the trail was halted due to efficacy. It was rejected by the FDA due to its third party manufacture unrelated to the drug itself, but the FDA had an issue with the volume labels. Since the rejection in march the company had addressed all the issues and has begun manufacturing the drug to prepare for 2021 distribution upon approval.  They created a dedicated team to address the issues.
3. Most of the insiders have not sold their shares.
4. Institutional ownership is at 31.01%
5. The lawsuits are superficial and will die in court. They addressed it on their last earnings call that they would Vigorously fight them.
6. Its at a fucking discount only being 5.20 a share.
7.  My hypothesis for the timeline is as follows. The NDA approval normally takes six months. However, if its resubmitted there are two timelines it could follow; a 2 month timeline or a 6 month timeline. My money is on the two month timeline considering how effective the drug was, and that the real issue was at the third party manufacturer. The only thing that is unclear, is when resubmission will occur. My best guess is that it will either happen this quarter or in the first quarter of 2021.

**THIS PRESENTATION IS THE REASON I AM BULLISH:**

https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c13f4c6e17ba3aca12b9686/t/618b3d9d89755c08ab3bc41d/1636515230864/Cat+Rock+Capital+Presentation+on+Just+Eat+Takeaway.com+10+November+2021.pdf

So let me start by saying, I am not trying to be a corporate shill much like what people will peg me as. I don't like corporations as much as the next guy, but I think it's actually a really good opportunity to join Grubhub or buy the stock and potentially win big. I say this because there are a ton of posts on Blind/Reddit trying to find the next ""IPO"" (looking at you Rivian). However, I believe there are some companies in plain sight that can potentially 5x in terms of market sentiment and the government printing money in the next few years. Grubhub is one of them. 

Before we dive into the potential, I want point out the issues with Grubhub, and where there is risk. 

**Current Issues:**

\- Loss of market in suburban US

\- UI/UX (They improved UI recently but the logo / colors lack)

\- HIGHLY competitive GIG companies in US Markets

\- Reduction in Capital from stock market

\- Economics of gig based companies (Fee's / Caps)

I do think these are large problems, but I think the potential is still great. So let's address them one at a time.

**Loss of market:**

I believe this is one that Grubhub definitely fumbled on, which was the US Suburban market. They didn't respond to COVID effectively in suburbs and they ate a fat L. However, I think there strategy is still sound, which is to focus on cities which VALUE convenience and fast delivery. The thesis is that when people go back to the office (highly debated) they will be less likely to order delivery. This would be especially true in suburban areas where there is a lot of driving. I for one would have a higher likely hood to drive to a restaurant to pick up food then deliver it. This might not be the same for living in a highly dense city.  It's a moot point, but a strategy that is valid. I also think by pouring money to become the clear winners into these metro areas from other regions where JET (parent company of GH) which it is the clear winner in, it can drastically improve logistics and cost which will improve its unit economics. 

**UI/UX:**

The UI/UX and branding from Grubhub is confusing. It has the JET logo to be more in-line with the parent company. This logo to me is trash and can be improved. I am a firm believer that if you have the engineering + users the marketing is the easiest to improve. Moreover, I have seen improvements in the app with reels, and frankly I am thinking they will keep getting better because DASH is now more focused on putting ads on its mobile landing page which will dissuade users. 

**Highly Competitive GIG economies:**

GIG based companies like DASH, UberEats, Instacart etc. are super competitive and currently DASH has the edge. I think DASH is absolutely overvalued (15x revenue), it doesn't have a global presence and cannot acquire direct competition due to SEC laws. So where does it put DASH? It puts it in a highly competitive place where it needs to prove its unit economics and hold its position with a stock price that I believe will tumble. DASH needs to expand and grow but the market is so competitive and it is behind in the global economy losing in Asia, Europe (JET is the winner owns GH), etc. If they don't buy a grocery delivery company like Instacart, it puts them in a really weak position. This is why I believe it will deal with Survivorship bias, and it's exactly what Grubhub dealt with. It will seem like they are the winner and their lack of foresight can be their doom. DASH is so expensive, a larger company won't even look to acquire it, nor do I believe their leadership will allow it to be acquired. However, this makes Grubhub look like a steal in retrospect, because companies such as AMZN, Walmart, etc would all be good candidates to BUY GRUBHUB!. Yes, I believe they will get acquired or WILL partner with the likes of Instacart. This has huge potential upside, because the market needs consolidation. Also what is a better owner then AMZN their logical play is to move into food delivery that is already proven.  **Why do I think they will be acquired, well the CEO of JET Jitse Groen said it himself :). Moreover, so did the second highest stakeholder in GH.**

**Reduction in Capital:**

The stock is taking a hard tumble. I believe that GH is reaching its floor, and will bottom out. It might also seem like they are hemorrhaging capital, but they are actually getting more and hiring like crazy. That is because the strategy of JET is to take from winning markets and grow losing ones. JET is the 2nd largest food delivery company in the WORLD. Capital from JET is a lot more than it might be perceived. 

**Economics of gig:**

Gig economies as a whole have shit margins, and with Fee caps etc. it makes it even harder. However, what if I told you that these fee caps aren't here to stay. The reason being is that these companies are actually GOOD for restaurant's. There is weird sentiment that these companies are bad for restaurant's, but actually they are good. They are increasing revenue for them drastically, and solving logistics that the restaurant would not care to do. The shift to dark kitchens as well will only make their economics better because they can disrupt the market to have different levels of fee caps. Also, fee caps are being appealed left and right and I think they can win, because of the level of scrutiny into such laws. They are actually making huge headway here, and I think GH has a strategy to improve its economics with all of its partnerships with Corporations + Campuses using robotics.

**TLDR:**

GH has a lot of potential growth opportunities with their stock, but what makes me the most bullish is the potential of an ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH AMZN. In general the stock is undervalued, and is still growing like crazy. Even if they are losing to DASH, they will still continue to grow and improve and both may not fail.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvr7pt/grubhub_has_massive_potential_for_a_big_payout/

Okay, I quit engaging in what I would consider traditional investing at the beginning of July. Started off with some stupid meme bullshit, and not the good ones either. I bought some $WISH, $TLRY, $CLOV... you get the picture. Bought high and sold for losses by mid-august. I decided I would use Robinhood as my fuck around account for trading options and moved a majority of my funds to TDAmeritrade where I went all in on $SOFI (which Im very thankful for obviously lol). So I started trading options and started off by losing a bunch on $SAVE calls around their earnings. I bought $AMD after its first run and just didnt know what I was doing, lost more. I hit on one of the $AMC runs but didnt cash out early enough, reinvested too quickly, and was right back down. I proceeded to have a few more ups and downs until I told myself I needed to reevaluate. I was down just under $5,000 at the beginning of October. Well I had a killer two months, but I think it was more luck (and a lot of $SOFI). My best trade was an $80 weekly $RBLK call that I made over 500% on. Then, shit hit the fan again. Lost 60% on a $ROKU weekly and I thought $PLTR would rebound a bit quicker. I blew almost $5,000 in a week span, and after making nearly every cent back, I am down again. All time Im only down a couple hundred because of my TD account, but I love the freedom of options money. I currently have one open position: 18 $22 $SOFI calls for 11/19. I think it rebounds tomorrow, but if it continues this bearish trend Im going to bail on my calls.

I spent a shit ton of time over the past couple weeks reviewing candlestick patterns and other metrics. I feel like the most useful tools, at least for determining momentum, is MACD and RSI. Ive noticed when a stock opens below the MACD level and RSI is gradually declining, stocks are prone to jumps. Take $TSLA today for example: dipped under 20 day MA, showed early bullish signs, and nearly hit 20 day again. I know it had an early bearish pull back, but it never went under yesterdays high. I would say a recent day or weeks worth of candlesticks is a nice play to set a stop loss target. I now always have MACD (12,26,9), RSI (14), Bollinger Bands (20), and MA (50) indicators on every chart. Are there any other big metrics you guys have found success in utilizing for swing or even day trades? I have tried to limit myself down to 10-15 strong stocks that I keep tabs on, but Im leaning more towards 5-8 great ones instead. I obviously know earnings reports and media b.s. must always be taken into consideration, but thats all to be taken with a grain of salt. Greeks are basic. Delta is speed your calls move relative to stock price and Theta is time decay. I know this is a lot, but Im just trying to share experience and see what others think/do themselves. 

TLDR: I am an ape, I lost a nice chunk of money, made almost all of it back, and have now lost it again. I now actually try to use TA for my plays. Ill have gain porn soon.

Short squeeze dynamics drive Progenesis shares and vols sharply higher. Shares of the hard to borrow name up $1.18, or 34%, this morning near $4.65 with nearly 150k contracts trading in the first 30 minutes, including 26k Nov 4.5 calls and 17k Nov 5 calls. Largest trade was a buy of nearly 4200 Nov 4.5 calls for 55c as shares traded $4.30. Progenisis shares have difficult to borrow for months, but stock loan rates have spiked toward 100% in recent weeks as shares have lifted from 90c in late September to current six-month highs. Spiking with shares today are implied volatility levels, near 400% in the near term and 260% in Dec.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvr5z2/prog_is_moving/

I've recently inherited some money and wanted to invest in an Oil stock.  I'm leaning towards a company called Suncor Energy (SU) but I'm worried that, being a larger cap stock (20B), that there is less room for growth.

Does anyone have an aggressive energy play they'd be interested in sharing (One where Higher oil prices = higer stock price)?  

Or, maybe you think Oil isn't a good play right now at all?

Please let me know your suggestions or opinions, or any other resources I should consider!

They obviously didn't want us to notice this so here you go.

Payoneer vs PayPal

&gt;*Payoneer, the Paypal for Shithole Developing Countries*

Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world

The growth of Payoneers global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country.

2018 PayPal study suggest that Indias freelancers represent around one quarter of the worlds gig workforce.

**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**

*PayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India \~ Reuters*

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hhza5041h2081.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e6bf53ca2bac7703919dbfab86bacbc49c0e89

https://preview.redd.it/x0b8v621h2081.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb18aeaaf2806e2c0123eff083901b6b53691b5b

The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.

 Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.

 A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.

 Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/okzrve92h2081.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c61bd06737a159941b6f9f26d96255fc497029c7

So, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.

Say a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.

Payoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.

My view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h4bl85z2h2081.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d883ab62f7fb8a486f106a561fb6b927009211

The companys focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. Its also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6mxf5e3h2081.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b56c5ccf853698f4f9ded9ecff758e2235e20180

Who are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypals or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bt75qez3h2081.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16c8e2fe383ce420e3c7a435f414ce4a74f599fd

B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, scale and network effects. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like theyre benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)

Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.

&amp;#x200B;

The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneers business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The companys global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fbqvrzp4h2081.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b11294b0e932cc3737f7a0dba4788d382fc59e9

What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.

**Growth:**

Note that Payoneer currently doesnt do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).

We just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)

Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.

Wildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRMs have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.

SNOWs chart showed an inverse head and shoulders pattern followed by a 23% rally once the breakout was confirmed. Now let's take a look at NFLXs current chart:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CCHHGrHn

Practically the same as SNOWs with and inverse head and shoulders pattern. Today Netflix broke out of this trend by ending the daily candle above the shoulder resistance of the inverse head and shoulders. If this trades similar to SNOW then a rally in NFLX stock should ensue. 

To add to the beautiful chart pattern for NFLX, they recently crushed earnings and have had squid games recently come out which has attracted a lot of subscribers. All in all, NFLX is ready to pop and you do not want to miss out on the face ripping rally.

1,"11/17/2021, 10:05:13",92 cents on a dollar,SeriouzSpecter,"Question from a beginner here: I just queued a $30 purchase of [Stone.co](https://stone.co/) ($STNE). The share is valued at $28.40 and the website therefore said the estimated quantity would be **1.056338** (simple math).

When I bought it though, or queued it I guess, it said I had a pending purchase of 0.973078 shares.

The ratio of (1.056338/0.973078) shows that I was ""charged"" an 8% margin to purchase STNE. In other words I only got 92 cents on a dollar invested.

Is there any specific reason for this? I understand that the buy price will always be higher than the estimate price as a basic rule of investing but 8% seems a little exaggerated. If I invest $100 I don't want to lose $8 undercutting the market price.

PS: I found this ([https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/trading-fees-on-robinhood/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/trading-fees-on-robinhood/)) which explains a trading fee that should not relate to my case (i.e ""Robinhood does not pass this fee on to customers for sales with a notional value of $500 or less."")

**Calculations Show Pfizer FY2022 Top Line 120B+, 50% Higher Than Current Guidance**

Autists, lend me your ears.

Pfizers guide for 2022 is 1.7 billion doses. See slide 35.

&gt;https://investors.pfizer.com/investors-overview/default.aspx

But if you notice, they are manufacturing 4 billion doses. That's means pfizer expects all these countries to execute the options on their contract for bi-annual boosters. This is just like the option the EU has on the contract below.

&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/08/995007124/ramping-up-its-covid-response-eu-will-buy-up-to-1-8b-doses-of-pfizer-vaccine

That means pfizers actual vaccine sales will double current guidance, and revenue will be 120B for FY2022 and beyond.

FY2021 REVENUE = 40B (VACCINE) + 40B (OTHER) = 80B

&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/pfizer-q3-fy2021-earnings-report-recap-5208079

FY2022 REVENUE = 80B (VACCINE) + 40B (OTHER) = 120B

It's all because the virus reinfects quickly, and repeatedly.

I predicted this my DD 300 days ago, ""Vaccine boosters needed bi-annually"" 

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljda9r/vaccine_boosters_needed_biannually/

This is confirmed as the entire EU has approved 6 month boosters.

&gt;https://abc7ny.com/holidays-covid-thanksgiving-safe-during-the/11083355/

BNTX PFE are clear home runs. They are crushing all competition including Moderna. And they are going to raise guidance when these countries execute their options. Load to tits.

Anyway, as I was ridiculed and given this apt flair ELY came out and basically said Im a god. Now LISTEN CAREFULLY YOU PACK OF UNWASHED BEASTS BECAUSE TOP GOLF IS STILL NOT PRICED IN. 

Yes, you heard this right. Not only is ELYs top growth prospect not priced in the Q3 they showed that Top Golf outperformed their other segments and shows no signs of slowing. The CEO just announced plans of major expansion for Top Golf in the US and Europe. Currently there has been 6 upgrades IIRC. BoA just initiated coverage with $45 PT and a buy rating, Jefferies raised their PT to $60 amongst a slew of other analysts raising PTs coupled with buy ratings. and TOP GOLF STILL ISNT PRICED IN. Again, 2020 net revenue was $2b for ELY and they acquired Top Golf for $2.5b their market cap currently sits at $5.5b Top Golf isnt even priced in let alone getting a multiple as a growth prospect. Although their market cap has crept up $500 million since my last post which means the market is currently digesting the information. Even if Top Golf gets a multiple of x2 ELY is $38-$40. 

Now would be a good time to stop recording your wife banging her boyfriend and ask him if youre allowed to borrow some money for ELY so one day you can become the boyfriend.

Dear WSB

All my life, I've been filled with regrets, and they all have to deal with money. It's always been ""I'm grateful for what I have, but what if I had chosen another path? Wouldn't I be all the more better off?"" I'm not some software engineer degen making $400K a year or a 50-yr-old edge lord with millions to yolo on and be fine...no I'm the guy with the typical $60K/yr job who's stuck at a crossroad...will I be like this forever, working my way to meager earnings, never to taste the true delicacies that life has to offer? Or will I be able to make a stand and see if trading is truly is the path that I should be on? So today, I grabbed destiny by the balls. I don't think anything makes sense in this market...but that's how it is in life too. Pre-revenue means you're worth millions, and even what you beat expectations, it's not good enough. How asinine! How absurd! Truly, this is the world in which we live. So here is my heart, the fruits of my labor, all offered on one shot . If this is meant to be it will...if not, I heard $WEN is hiring, although, I'll still have my job...so I won't become some dude flippin patties and spreading buns, instead, I'll become a soul-less gear in a machine. So here's to the game! Here's to the thrill of victory and to the sting of defeat! Cheers to those who play, and woe to those who dream to die lost in their fears!

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks rose following the greatest increase in US retail sales since March, with figures from industry behemoths Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. indicating robust demand even as inflation squeezes purchasing power.
* The robust retail statistics, together with better-than-expected factory output and homebuilder optimism, helped rally markets, overshadowing comments from Fed's Bullard that the central bank should reduce monetary assistance more quickly to offset inflation.
* The S&amp;P 500 extended its November surge, while all major equity indices advanced. Treasuries dropped.
* Biden informed reporters that a nominee for Fed head would be announced in ""the next four days."" Biden is debating whether to re-appoint Jerome Powell as chairman. He's also interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is sought by several progressive politicians and activists for the role. According to a person familiar with the situation, the president has yet to make a decision.
* Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists raised their estimate for US equities, predicting that the surge that has driven the benchmark index to consecutive record highs will continue into 2022. Global fund managers in Bank of America Corp.'s November poll had the largest overweight in American shares since August 2013, while JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists remain positive on equities despite forecasts that central banks would remain dovish.

2. Most brokerage firm do Payment for order flow(PFOF), it's not just Robinhood and they are not charity, they need money. Do limit orders.
3. With the GME incident, I see that they rarely halt a stock anymore.. in fact I see a message that x stock is halted on other firms but not Robinhood.
4. Charts are lacking some complex calculations but honestly it's super useful after you have done your homework on the stock you want to buy.
5. Best Margin rates and portfolio margin.
6. UI is arguably the best with categories, explanations, colors, rendering and speed.
7. Cash management, avoid a tax event by using this at 2.5% instead of liquidating positions for selective purchases that you plan to pay back soon. The position may earn you more and cover 2.5 easily.

1,"11/17/2021, 08:16:22",Taxes and You,Captain_Yolo_,"# As someone who got fucked over by them, I wanted to do this writeup to help others understand how they work and what to lookout for.

**Why are you doing this now?:**

The first thing you need to understand is that the IRS sees your taxes on a per-year basis. When you see all those tax forms asking you lived in a state until Dec. 31st? Yep, that's the cutoff. They don't give a shit about anything that happens after that when it's time to file. That means that your gains at that time are all that matter. If you made $100k between Jan and Dec 31st and your wife says you need to invest into her CBD oil shenanigans and it goes tits up this January - The IRS only sees you made $100k and you are % fucked. I have read horror stories [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/mfegx4/reclaiming_my_life_after_being_destroyed_by_crypto/) about people who made tens of thousands in one year and then have to file bankruptcy because they YOLOed it all in Spring and lost. I am not even going to cover wash sales here. Just know if you make money, the government wants to fuck you.

**Short-term gains vs. long-term gains vs. loss:**

ALL of your gains become ordinary income. Your income tax bracket will be gains + salary. I'm going to use high-estimates here but feel free to [Please check these brackets for yourself](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp). Expect 37% for your short-term gains and 20% for your long term gains. If you only have losses, you don't have to worry about any of this.

**I made plenty, why should I care?**:

Because if you have made plenty and already know you are going to pay plenty; this allows you to take on perhaps a more risky move later in the year, because every dollar you are positive the government is going to snatch $0.37 of. 

You also need to consider your method of payment come tax time. I was caught with my trousers down not because I had *squandered* my gains; but because I had *invested* them. Once May came around, turbotax is telling me I owe $20k and have a week to pay it. Which would not be a problem had I set this money aside from the start. But why would I? The dollar is a depreciating asset. Not a chance I was going to let that cash sit in purchasing power. I put it into shares that I could hold for at least a year because I fucking hate taxes! I was willing to do anything that would prevent me from having to withdraw those shares and pay....MORE short-term gains taxes!

**Payment methods:**

Yes the IRS does offer payment plans, but they are all through third parties and there isn't too much wiggle room, the further you extend it the worst your interest rate gets. This is where some advanced traders game the system more. A +$10k unavoidable bill some will just open a new credit line, accept all the rewards that come with it and a low APR and slowly work it down.

For me, I contacted my CC Provider (Discover) and told them straight up that I did not wish to manage another line of credit and asked if they would raise my limit to cover the bill. I have a good credit score and history with them. I also asked them for a few months to pay it off and I wanted 0.0% APR. They gave me a whole year at 0.0%. It is not them just being nice, it is because if I did not finish paying that debt off in a year, my APR would jump to 25% and things can go downhill very quickly.

**Roth account:**

If you do not have this already, get it now. You need to be maxing this out every fucking year. This is not your Robinhood where every positive cent you make the government gets part of. The shares (and options ) you purchase in this bad boy are tax fucking free.

**Who are you?**

[I was poor, then I wasn't](https://i.imgur.com/mg17Vpn.png) and then I found out about taxes. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**:

If you lost money this year ignore everything but Roth. If you made money this year, get ready to be paying 20% minimum come May, and don't do stupid shit and lose it all by then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvm7gl/taxes_and_you/

Its actually starting to piss me off. The current valuation its at makes not one bit of sense. For starters they have a roughly 2 Billion dollar valuation at the time Im making this, but their equity alone is nearly 1 fucking billion. What the actual fuck. Like I get that their still losing millions of monies every quarter, but all signs point towards that beautiful EPS losing its stupid little dash at the beginning of next year. Dont even get me started on their earnings report. Posted a 36% increase in revenue for the quarter. WHICH IS 900% YOY REVENUE GROWTH. But what happens? The stock falls 20% bc some Wall Street analysts high on meth and STI meds decided to project 50 FUCKING PERCENT QUARTERLY GROWTH. Dont even get me started on their tripled manufacturing to meet demand, the release of their P-50 or any of the bullish as fuck macros or any of the shorts. Even with all this the stock STILL KEEPS GOING DOWN. Thank god I have options disabled on my account.

You regret NOT getting in on the GME train? Or the AMC train? I know I do. The last year 1.5 years has seen an incredible change in stock trading thanks to communities such as the wallstreetbets. This would be my first post here, as I type this, I fully expect this to be removed but in case it reaches you here are my thoughts on INO and why I think it deserve your attention and consideration as an investment....

There has been numerous scientific publications over the course of last six months that point to INO 4800 (COVID Vaccine) to be best of the breed. The currently ongoing PHASE III trials in Thailand, India, Columbia, Mexico, China, and Philippines will bear this out. The vaccine is rather easy to manufacture and easy to transport as it is stable at room temperature. Furthermore, the current literature suggests that INO would prove to be more durable and require much less boosting that we seem to need with the current set of vaccines in the market. Of course, it was held back in the US as FDA for whatever reason did not like the delivery device ..FDA finally changed it's mind and lifted the hold as well...so Phase 3 in the US too...

But Covid isn't the only play INO has to offer. It seems to have produced great results in treating GMB (Glioblastoma Cancer) , HPV (Phase III results look favorable), Has Lassa Fever Vaccine trial on-going in Africa. MERS, Zika, and Ebola vaccine trails are all ongoing. 

The company continue to produce good news and we see 40-70% of the daily volume being sold short....I think someone is afraid and hoping to prevent a GME style squeeze... please do your own DD ...and if you see it as we (INOVIANS we call ourselves) ... please join the fight...it will not only mean riches but it will mean supporting a company that is about the change medicine for the better....

1,"11/17/2021, 07:04:47","BUY Razer Inc, before the company gets delisted?",Mag_Meyreddit,"Hi everyone, Razer Inc., Ticker: 1337

is probably about to get delisted from the SEHK (The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.) by its founders, in order to ""relist"" it at the New York Stock Exchange.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/razer-execs-plan-value-firm-up-45-bln-take-private-deal-sources-2021-11-16/](https://www.reuters.com/business/razer-execs-plan-value-firm-up-45-bln-take-private-deal-sources-2021-11-16/)

The reason behind that first of all is, that the management of the company believes the stock is highly undervalued and would reflect companys value much better if it would be traded in the US where also the headquarter of Razer Inc. is located.

Fact is, that Razer became profitable this year and has so far had a fantastic run. They increased their revenue by 68% and their earnings by 47 % Year over year and are forecast to continue increasing revenue and earnings by the same amount.

[https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/tech/hkg-1337/razer-shares#past](https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/tech/hkg-1337/razer-shares#past)

Also at the moment Razer is debt free and does currently sale at a price to sales ratio of 2.1x which makes the stock very interesting to me.

Indeed I came to the conclusion, as 3 other analysts, that Razer who had 1.5 billion in sales over the last 12 months is highly undervalued, if you consider their market cap of 3.17 billion, the fact that they are now profitable and that they are forecast to have a 47.6% annual earnings growth.

[https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/tech/hkg-1337/razer-shares#future](https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/tech/hkg-1337/razer-shares#future)

Post scriptum I want to add, that I do think that the fin tech aspect of Razer with the Razer services as well as Razer gold and Razer silver which is highly popular in Asia as well as the strong brand itself (there are people with Razer Tattoos on their legs) Makes the company very interesting.

1,"11/17/2021, 06:17:25","Redfin (RDFN) is the play, here's why",Amurphy747,"Hello Autists,

***What is Redfin?***

  Redfin is a residential real estate brokerage. The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure, improve the quality of the customer experience, all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs. Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for ones real estate needs. **Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer. To change an industry that has had little disruption. Redfin's business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home.**

This company does it all, they will buy your house, sell your house, you can buy a house on it, get approved for a mortgage, get a mortgage, or even hire a concierge service to get your home ready for people to view it in person or online. They have the best user interface out of all the real estate online models and have a more hands on approach, as well as a great track record of smart growth led by strong management which cannot be said about other players in this space.

&amp;#x200B;

[User interface is much more user friendly ](https://preview.redd.it/ac19fcmk11081.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a505497da94fa1f37729619d23e456921252afd)

***Introduction***

This DD is about Redfin. Here is the background on Zillow shit the bed with their earnings, like horribly shit the bed. Their shitty algorithm to buy homes purely based on surround location data made them shut down their iBuying program and cut 25% of employees. In 3 months alone Zillow lost over 420 million dollars. The stock after earnings has lost over 40% of their value in a month. This DD is not about Zillow but is about Redfin. 

This collapse of Zillow has hurt the outlook and confidence from investors in the online real estate/brokerage space. Even though Zillow now primarily only makes  money by selling advertisements to real estate agents to list their home, much different then the multiple use approach Redfin uses.  

RedfinNow which is the iBuying program that Redfin launched in 2018, is under a microscope due to Zillow's pitfalls from investors. While Zillow dropped the entire program, Redfin is committed to aggressively growing their program which is displayed by their cash from investments on the cash flow statements where 414 million was used to buy homes. They still however have a strong balance sheet with other 562 million dollars in cash. 

**Stocks falls when there is uncertainty. Investors tend to avoid uncertainty.**  **The big question for Redfin is if Zillow, which is widely considered to have the most  complete real estate data in the industry and has been around for far longer than Redfin, is failing to see the light at the end of its Zillow Offers tunnel, will Redfin eventually fold its hand as well? No.**

Redfin uses real people, and visits the home on site and actually actively invest in these houses. Zillow relies purely on bullshit numbers that don't apply to every house in the same way. People are nervous of this investing by Redfin into iBuying....but Zillow left so now there is more room for Redfin to grab market share. Now is a great time to enter Redfin.

&amp;#x200B;

[iBuying can and will be effecitve](https://preview.redd.it/dauhlqxv11081.png?width=337&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=809a8e4be5c4e4afb04859ed9c8f68e47c5dae47)

*The investment thesis*

Redfin which is only 1% above 52 week lows after the Zillow miss, will trade higher through a **revolutionary strong iBuying program, increase in housing supply, rentpath acquistion, and the rise of interest rates is not to fear.**

***i******Buying program*** 

Redfin reported its third quarter earnings, beating expectations for revenue ($540 million, up 128% year-over-year), and just missing on earnings per share (-$0.20).  They posted a small profit of only $20,000 this quarter with this program. Which is much better than the 400 million dollars lost by Zillow. Zillow tried to expand too fast with this program, which made their balance sheet too volatile and eat up too much capital.

**Redfin isnt placing all its eggs in one basket with iBuying.** Its part of what we do, but its not who we are, Glenn Kelman the CEO and face of Redfin said,  Its one of many offerings available to customers, including a brokered sale with a lower transaction fee paid by the homeowner. 

Redfin is doing controlled growth in a new space. Redfin is slowly moving their iBuying program city to city (currently in more than 20 cities), and as earnings continue to grow and come out, confidence will be stronger in their iBuying program. 

Zillow went wrong with being too aggressive and shot themselves with a RPG in the foot. But this feature that Redfin continues to grow and expand, not only brings more customers to Redfin but is making it the one stop shop for real estate for their consumers. This program is an exciting segment that is not even the primary focus of their business. And the program is only a few years old and is already profitable. The management is showing their value with how Zillow fucked up. 

***Increase in housing supply/ Interest Rate Concerns*** 

 More affordable housing is finally coming back onto the market. More low-priced homes were put up for sale in the third quarter of 2021 than any other segment, according to the latest housing report from Redfin. Homes in the most affordable tier, which represents homes priced below 95% of others on the market, rose by 13% compared to a year prior. 

This is important because right now, houses are expensive. People have thought Redfin would do amazing from the home price surge we have seen since the pandemic. Truth is, growth has had a dent due to the high prices of these houses. People that are working class use Redfin, not your typical multimillionarie Chad who doesnt mind paying the hot real estate agent an extra 3-4% on commission.  

With the price of lumber, labor supply, and super low mortgage rates which contribute to the higher listing prices of homes....an increase in interest rates will actually benefit Redfin I believe. **A rise in interest rates will not mean a foreclosure market...but rather a rebalanced market.**

The larger supply of homes at the cheaper end of the spectrum can relieve pressure on prices and create an opportunity for more people to buy. That means more balance between demand and supply across the housing market in the next year, and less intense competition for homes. The increase in supply for affordable listings is coming at a good time for those people who want to buy homes but don't want to put a down payment of 50k. This is Redfin's customer base and this will benefit their business model. the fear of interest rates is being overlooked, and will be a benefit.

 

***Acquisition of Rentpath***

In February, Redfin moved into the rental industry, acquiring RentPath for $608 Million. RentPath has more than 20,000 apartment buildings on its rental websites, and grew its traffic more than 25% last year. One in five of Redfins 40+ million monthly visitors also wants to see homes for rent.

Redfin plans to have all of Rentpaths listing on their own website by 2022, the partnership will allow for:

\- Better Search Experience

\- Better Value for Advertisers

\-Higher Traffic Growth

\-And open up to a younger customer base as many younger people want to see rentals because they are not in a position to buy a house whether it be because of finances, job, etc.

Add in the extreme surge in home prices....renting is a very attractive option....and by getting younger people who typically rent on redfin platforms they will be more likely to return when it comes time to buy a home. A great long term business model for growth and shows again the competence of management. 

***What do the Wall Street Pros think? Risks?***

&amp;#x200B;

[There is a wide range but the average sees a 37&amp;#37; upside](https://preview.redd.it/ndykk6iv61081.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=250f13428bc90bc4071b2fbcf54f458a18c6a2c7)

Overall Wall Street thinks the stock is undervalued. There are bears with the lowest thinking the price in a year will be $27 which can happen if the housing market does not increase supply to match demand in the affordable sector. But if the housing market prevails and Redfin Now beats expectations that are already low due to Zillow's pitfalls I see that the high price target of $88 definitely being possible. WallStreetZen's DCF 

***The Play***

Obviously this could be a longer term play. I entered today on 5 **Feb 18 '22 $45 calls**, may add more as I am down 11% to average, they are trading at 52 week lows and for a stock that typically trades in a 50-60 dollar range the last few months, trading at around $5.40 while having a beta of almost 2 after a 17% drop from highs this month. Seems like one hell of a play leading into next earnings once the Zillow worries subdue and housing supply numbers continue to impress.

&gt;  
&gt;is probably about to get delisted from the SEHK (The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.) by its founders, in order to ""relist"" it at the New York Stock Exchange.   
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/business/razer-execs-plan-value-firm-up-45-bln-take-private-deal-sources-2021-11-16/](https://www.reuters.com/business/razer-execs-plan-value-firm-up-45-bln-take-private-deal-sources-2021-11-16/)   
&gt;  
&gt;The reason behind that first of all is, that the management of the company believes the stock is highly undervalued and would reflect companys value much better if it would be traded in the US where also the headquarter of Razer Inc. is located.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fact is, that Razer became profitable this year and has so far had a fantastic run. They increased their revenue by 68%  and their earnings by 47 % Year over year and are forecast to continue increasing revenue and earnings by the same amount.   
&gt;  
&gt;[https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/tech/hkg-1337/razer-shares#past](https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/tech/hkg-1337/razer-shares#past)  
&gt;  
&gt;Also at the moment Razer is debt free and does currently sale at a price to sales ratio of 2.1x which makes the stock very interesting to me.   
&gt;  
&gt;Indeed I came to the conclusion, as 3 other analysts, that Razer who had 1.5 billion in sales over the last 12 months is highly undervalued, if you consider their market cap of 3.17 billion, the fact that they are now profitable and that they are forecast to have a 47.6% annual earnings growth.

&gt;What do you think? Is it time to grab some Razer shares before the company squires the 90% of the free float in order to delist it from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvjlqk/razer_delisting_massive_gains_ahead/

1,"11/17/2021, 06:08:44",Cricut my Life into Pieces (CRCT),MrDionWaiters,"Most of you probably dont know this company by name, but you very likely have seen their products if you know any Beckys that like Etsy. This is a squeeze waiting to happen, but also a fundamentally sound play as well. Ill talk about fundamentals first and the squeeze potential later.

Cricut sells machines that cut out designs which can be used for arts and crafts or for items sold on places like Etsy. CRCT sells these at a low margin, because once Becky has a machine they make their margins from selling her the materials that the machines cut and app subscriptions used to make designs to print out.

The stock recently got crushed after earnings because the numbers are not as good as a year ago in regard to profits which is because margins were insane a year ago because Becky was stuck at home and also because shipping costs were not insane yet. Additionally, profits are down because of the revenue mix itself. The lower margin machines were a larger percentage of the total revenue because the higher margin materials were only up 2% YoY because everyone was out enjoying the reopening instead of hanging out at home (mgmt even said this would happen, but I suppose the people selling the stock have a short memory).

I think the drop in the stock price is dumb because revenue is up 24% YoY from a tough comp from the covid bump and more importantly because subscription revenue is up 70% YoY. Mgmt even said that they expect to grow subscribers by 2 million compared to 1.8m last year, which is big since last year was the covid bump but the company is holding onto the growth momentum.

In regard to the balance sheet, there is no long term debt and only $327m in liabilities compared to $980m in assets ($224m of which is in cash).

The quarterly report is worth a look, and if you have time to burn I would check out the presentation that was given alongside the earnings call: [https://investor.cricut.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cricut-inc-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results](https://investor.cricut.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cricut-inc-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results)

**Squeeze potential**

For most, there is no interest in anything unless there is squeeze potential. Well oh boy do we have it here As of close, there are only 100 shares available to borrow [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRCT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRCT) and the borrow fee is 28%, which is fairly high. If you look at volume, you can see that shorts are stuck since volume is too low to be able to get out. 23% of the float was short as of this morning, so if any other insiders get buying or a new large player decides that this is a good stock to own, this could move up violently depending on whether or not shorts try to escape before their bonuses get Cri-Cut

I own shares and a few calls, I plan to be selling puts on dips below $25 since that is around where Abdiel has been buying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvjivk/cricut_my_life_into_pieces_crct/

Some companies have posted their Q3 reports, which caused lots of social activity around the tickers. It's a nice indicator for making the investments - the more positive/negative social discussions around the company's ticker - the more chances to see the change in its stock.

**So here are the most discussed companies on Twitter over the last week:**

**1. Vallon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (**[**$VLON**](https://contora.ai/ticker/VLON)**)** \- a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary biopharmaceutical products. Quite a brilliant and interesting project at its early stage. Its community is also fast-growing (they hit more than 5000 followers on ValonToken for a few days). This has definitely huge potential as well - this ticker has lots of positive social discussions around it! They are building a decentralized BSC Metaverse, and the project launch is scheduled for 2021 December.

**2. Titan Machinery Inc. (**[**$TITN**](https://contora.ai/ticker/TITN)**)** \- the company sells and services agricultural and construction equipment in the United States and Europe. They have a $700M Market Cap. Last week Titan Machinery announced that it will release financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2021, on Tuesday, November 23, 2021. This announcement caused high activity around the company and traders are trying to predict the results.

**3. FLEX LNG Ltd. (**[**$FLNG**](https://contora.ai/ticker/FLNG)**)** \- the company, through its subsidiaries, engages in the seaborne transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) worldwide. A few hours ago they have just released their Q3 report, and that was the reason for a big number of discussions over the last week. $FLNG has great presentations on their website covering not just shipping, but LNG &amp; Energy markets in general - the traders are excited about it and go for a long.

Fucking hurting my brain over here. NEGG has always been a mystery to me but its treated me well.  


Also, why would the **par value** be $0.021848 per share when it's trading at $18+?  


either way, the market cap is 6.8 Billion, so a $300 million stock offering shouldn't really matter that much, right? That might explain why it gobbled up yesterdays AH selloff. PE ratio is pretty high at 191 but it's 2021, kind of hard to find a healthy PE ratio.   


As for why it's running up, the only published explanation is their new Holiday Marketing Campaign. Could be that but that doesn't really explain the insane volume. Av. Volume at the beginning of last week was 400k. Av volume now is like 4mill with it hitting 8m on certain days this past week.  


I'm relatively certain that the summer run-up was a gamma squeeze (and please don't hate me, it might have triggered a small short squeeze), so I'm not expecting it to go to $70-80 again. Interested to see where this constant buying pressure takes it though.

Degenerates, Gay Bears, SPY 800c Perma bulls, SPAC'tards, Shkreli fan boys, Elon cult followers, Theta gang (f\*ck you), And market top Rivian investors, everyone listen...

I think its about time

Gather round

Back in November 2019 I randomly gambled $10k on 3 month out BB call options. Randomly.

By December 1st, BB had announced IVY Amazon partnership and those contracts went up to $70k. Serendipity.

I ended up rolling those calls, buying more shares, and hoarding as much BB stock as I could during this time.

In January 2020, a month later, GME began. &amp; Meme stock mania began. The rest is history.

WSB culture had entered Mainstream Media, CNBC labelled us enemies of the market, Cramerwanted to touch our pee pee's, weird psychos flooded the subreddit trying to fit in, and people from all parts of the globe flocked here to battle against Wallstreet, a modern day technological California gold rush.

And what was the result of all this?

For some, lives changed with a windfall of cash, and for others, bags of heaviest proportions.

Now why are we here? On this forum specifically?

**To f\*cking gamble.**

But why? Why take the risk with our hard earned money?

**For f\*cking freedom.**

We want to spend time doing things we love... not slaving away 40-60 hour work weeks just to eat, sleep and repeat while the few at the top enjoy copious amounts of resources at our expense.

The stock market gives us a chance at this. A way out of the rat race and into the upper echolons of financial freedom.

**HOWEVER...**

We need realize who our competetion is. The assholes at the top of the market food chain, they lie, they cheat, and they steal from retail. They have quants, algorithmic trading, arbitrage opportunities, payment for order flow, swaps and credit products we've never even heard of, insider information, analysts in their pockets, lawyers, judges and politicians in the palm of their hands.... the list goes on.

That\^ is our f\*cking competition in the ""free"" market. **THAT\^\^\^\^**

What the f\*ck do we have? Nothing.... We have absoluetly nothing.

**Yet...** for once, we won. During the Meme Stock Mania We broke the code, we found the weakness, and we gambled like our f\*cking lives depended on it because our lives **DO DEPEND ON IT.**

And what do these scum market manipulators do when we get an edge and start winning? They disable the buy button. They change the rules. They turn off the console because they're losing.

Steve Cohen directly tweeted at retail taunting us after disabling the buy button ""Rough crowd on twitter tonight. Hey stock jockeys keep bringing it"" ........

A multibillionaire, more money than he will ever know what to do with, the top of the 1%, laughing and taunting retail because they were on the winning side of the trade against him and he cheated.

I watched $650k unrealized gains dwindle to $300k unrealized gains, and I sold there. At the low of the day when the buy button was disabled. Yes that is a lot of money... But don't think for a f\*cking second I haven't lost sleep over being **CHEATED.**

The day the buy button was disabled, GME was heading to $1000 per share, and BB was headed to $50 per share. I would've entered millionaire status, and finally had f\*ck you money and financial freedom. I got cheated out of this. I'm still in shock this was allowed to happen. It's ABSOLUTE f\*cking bullish\*t.

...I've dreamed of revenge all year. Cohen, Ken, and all the other elite market players milking retail, and naked shorting stocks into oblivion. God damn crooks.

I think the time has finally come retards...

**LISTEN:**

I am not going into specifics because it will take too long, and I'm too lazy. But for reasons unknown, although there are many theories as to why; GME makes 90 day bull cycle runs. 4 months of the year, GME runs, like clockwork. Nov 23rd being the next bull run. Check the DD by u/Leenixus to get a better grasp as to possibly why... He has correlated these cyclical bull runs with SLD deposits ands options clearing dates. Again, November 23rd is the next bull cycle.

**Now...** Why did GME move so hard in January 2020? The only anomaly for January versus the other 4 bull cycle months is that January had a bank holiday in the middle of the SLD deposit process.

**Guess what?** We have another one of these anomalies coming up this February... And it won't come again for another decade...

Sometimes its the little things that can take down empires... like a simple anomaly

January could very well be a huge breakout month leading into that anomaly month of February where the final showdown could take place.

The hedge funds might be predicting this as well. The hedge funds are currently trading variance swaps on GME that retail doesn't have direct access to. These variance swaps short volatility on GME. These are basically calls or puts on GME's volatility, with the underlying being the IV rank at the agreed expiration date.

Now how in the hell do you hedge a product like this? If volatility goes wild, where do you need insurance?

Obviously to hedge against volatility spikes, one must buy WAY OTM calls and puts as insurance in case a massive IV spike happens. As these options will be up HUGE. Same way we buy FD's and lottos. Small premium, large protection.

Guess what? January, out of all other months, has a ridiculous amount of OI on way OTM calls and puts, I'm talking 50 cent f\*cking puts, 900 calls. Lots of open interest. Whoever is involved in subduing GME price in the current wedge is hedged to the tits for January. Why? They are expecting f\*cking volatility. Nobody is buying a f\*ck ton of 50 cent puts with an OI of 136,176 unless it's to HEDGE against expectations of insane volatility.

If GME breaks out in January and heads into February (the anomaly month), this f\*cking thing could actually happen.

There's tons of DD and ideas why, claims about Citadel's infinite money glitch short algo using cheap call options on ex dividend dates of GME to cover their naked S's causing a 90 day cyclical pattern in GME for years that's still in effect. Either way, its UNDENIABLE, GME has a cycle. Clear as f\*cking day. And history doesn't repeat but it often rhymes...

What's most likely happened is a wrench was thrown into their infinite money supply short algo during meme stock mania last year, and so much money is on the line right now along with systemic risk, that changing any variables on their algo is like diffusing a bomb right now, cut the wrong wire, and BOOM.

I haven't touched or looked at meme stocks since what happened with the buy button. In fact I found the people obsessed with GME CRINGE AS F\*CK. Unbearably cringe. Cringeeeee omg cringe. Pure cringe.

But I think there is something here...

The play here would be low IV ITM calls on GME going into Nov 23rd. 180-190c at the moment. An influx of these buys could cause a big bull cycle for November, causing a break out of the wedge heading into the hedge funds expected volatility month of January, and finally into the anomaly bank holiday month of February. Sh\*t is going down anytime from now until February 23rd.

*This is not financial advice. These are risky options. If GME gets below 180-190 or near this price heading into the expiration date you've chosen, these options will be worth next to nothing.

Hi David,

I want to start by saying I have great respect for you and your fundamental anal-ysis of companies. Sorry about your divorce and the $11B collapse in your AUM. I see you are doing well and sporting a new hairdo, chicks must be digging it. If not, no worries, you have 410,000 shares of PlayBoy to satisfy your needs. But please keep your PlayBoy stash under you bed, not in the public (13Fs). Please just don't $JACK your 148,800 shares in public though. While you were losing money I managed to get returns you would never see in your lifetime.

The best time to buy Sonos was in Q2 of 2020. Not now. You are late to the party. They have been crushing the earnings but home audio upgrade cycle that we saw over the last year has come to an end.

In my DD, when I was long, I came to realize the management is world class and beautiful Sant Barbara weather was keeping staff saine and productive. You can't catch a virus when inhaling salty ocean air. That's a fact you can take to the bank (but not doctor). People stuck at home were improving their home audio, watching more TV, buying speakers for their computers and zoom meatings (pun intended). Looking at revenue growth you can easily see that:

Yes, the launch of ""Never Stop Exploring"" radio station was a great strategy. Their partnership with Liverpool Football Club was great too. But is all of that priced in? I'd say yes.

Here is the rub though. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 258.8%, talk about high expectations as the Covid induced upgrade boom is winding down. Can they keep up? I doubt it.

The bulls may say they recently launched Beam (gen 2), but I say that soundbar looks nearly identical to its predecessor. It is equipped with Dolbys Atmos technology which is great. Now Dolby is a long worth considering. Yes, I am hedged and own Dolby which is a much better company. The fact is that about 11 million households had Sonos products as of the end of fiscal 2020. The incremental buyer of Sonos products is simply no longer willing to pay $200 to $1200 for Sonos products. Products from Alphabet and Amazon are cheaper. The latest Amazon Echo, for instance, costs $100. A first-generation Google Mini can be had for $25. Any price increase will eat into the TAM.

Sonos recently won a lawsuit against Google for patent infringement. Unless Sonos manages to get a licensing agreement from Google regarding their recent patents lawsuits I don't see any good news for this quarter that is not priced in yet.

There is supply chain issues which in August earnings report was discussed as follows: *supply-chain constraints, which are broadly shared across our sector, have increasingly impacted our efforts to fulfill the ever-growing demand for our products.* Sounds like they have to adjust their Q4 targets down if they can't get their products manufactured. The good news is that the demand won't be there.

David, in you letter to investor you acknowledge that there will be challenges ahead. Then why wouldn't I buy puts going into earnings report when we are 12% up from local bottom.

Finally I will leave you with one graph about Sonos. This graph is inversely correlated to demand for Sonos products. The higher the graph goes the more beneficial it is to short the stock. Last quarter was bad.

Just to be clear. Sonos is a great company and a long term buy and hold but this quarter's report isn't getting me excited. If there is a drop post call, it would be a good buying opportunity.

My beautiful wife has a best friend who is a manager at *JCREW*. Unfortunately, it is ***NOT*** publicly traded. However, at the given time, they are at record sales and even breaking all prepandemic goals. This tiny store makes almost 100k usd on sales by lunch and can barely fit 20 customers in its doors at a time. And the holiday season hasn't even started yet! 

Recently, *DDS*, Dillards, had ER and absolutely spanked the estimates just like my wifes bf spanks me into submission. It's beautiful! Quickly, climbed over 10% and still holds at it's higher lvls.  *JCREW* hints at, and Dillards confirms that people are back to not giving a fu\*\* about Covid but instead about what thong to buy their husbands. So I'm playing it.

With *TJX* releasing in the morning, and *M* on Thursday, why not trust a complete stranger who has a bruise in his bum from his wifes boyfriends abnormally big thumb?!

Hi David,

I want to start by saying I have great respect for you and your fundamental anal-ysis of companies. Sorry about your divorce and the $11B collapse in your AUM. I see you are doing well and sporting a new hairdo, chicks must be digging it. If not, no worries, you have 410,000 shares of PlayBoy to satisfy your needs. But please keep your PlayBoy stash under you bed, not in the public (13Fs). Please just don't $JACK your 148,800 shares in public though. While you were losing money I managed to get returns you would never see in your lifetime.

Now Dolby is a long worth considering. Yes, I am hedged and own Dolby which is a much better company. The fact is that about 11 million households had Sonos products as of the end of fiscal 2020. The incremental buyer of Sonos products is simply no longer willing to pay $200 to $1200 for Sonos products. Products from Alphabet and Amazon are cheaper. The latest Amazon Echo, for instance, costs $100. A first-generation Google Mini can be had for $25. Any price increase will eat into the TAM.  

Sonos recently won a lawsuit against Google for patent infringement. Unless Sonos manages to get a licensing agreement from Google regarding their recent patents lawsuits I don't see any good news for this quarter that is not priced in yet. 

There is supply chain issues which in August earnings report was discussed as follows: *supply-chain constraints, which are broadly shared across our sector, have increasingly impacted our efforts to fulfill the ever-growing demand for our products.* Sounds like they have to adjust their Q4 targets down if they can't get their products manufactured. The good news is that the demand won't be there.

David, in you letter to investor you acknowledge that there will be challenges ahead. Then why wouldn't I buy puts going into earnings report when we are 12% up from local bottom.  

Finally I will leave you with one graph about Sonos. This graph is inversely correlated to demand for Sonos products. The higher the graph goes the more beneficial it is to short the stock. Last quarter was bad.

As of 12:45 p.m. EST, Lucids shares were up about 17.7% from.",Lostify1006,"G What happened

Shares of electric vehicle maker Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) were moving sharply higher on Tuesday, after the company reported third-quarter earnings and confirmed its production plans for next year.

As of 12:45 p.m. EST, Lucid's shares were up about 17.7% from Monday's closing price.

So what

Lucid reported on Monday afternoon that it lost $524.4 million in the third quarter, or $0.43 per share, on revenue of $232,000 as it prepared to start production of its innovative Air luxury sedan.

Those numbers fell short of Wall Street's expectations, as analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a loss of $0.25 per share on revenue of $1.25 million. But electric vehicle investors didn't seem concerned about the ""miss,"" in light of what was arguably much more important news: Lucid confirmed its plans to build about 20,000 vehicles next year.

Production of the Lucid Air began in late September, with the first deliveries to customers in October. Image source: Lucid Group.

That number came with a caveat, as CEO Peter Rawlinson said that ongoing global supply chain disruptions could throw a wrench into Lucid's production plans. But, he said, the company has taken steps to mitigate potential supply risks, and as of now it expects to hit its production target and launch three more versions of the Air sedan by the end of next year as planned.

Now what

Lucid didn't offer financial guidance for the current quarter, an understandable decision given that deliveries of the Air sedan just began last month. But in addition to confirming its production target for next year, it said that it has begun an expansion of its Arizona assembly plant that will increase its capacity from about 34,000 vehicles per year now to about 90,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2023.

Ault Global Holdings, Inc. (DPW) engages in the design, development, manufacture, and sale of customized and flexible power system solutions for the medical, military, telecom, and industrial markets. It's current share price at the time of the post is $2.05/share with analyst price targets ranging from a low of $6 to a high of $25. Although it's a small cap stock with a market cap of \~$120mil, FINVIZ shows phenomenal fundamentals for having such a status. You can see this by following the link:[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=dpw](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=dpw)   


DPW is a company that has seen a tremendous beatdown due to poor market rotation and the consistent shorting of the stock. However, after reaching a low of $0.53 after its long gruesome downtrend, it has seemed to be picking up institutional buyers; and 90% of its holders have a cost basis range from $2.03-$2.44/share according to Webull market resources

Although bears would argue that it has taken on a substantial amount of debt, I've come to find that through bullish news releases announcing solid acquisitions and investments made on part of the company, the stock has increased its YoY earnings by over 1,000%, thus improving the company's ability to pay off the debt in a speedy manner.  


To add, earnings are announced on the 26th, and expectations are for the company to announce a second straight quarter of profitable growth, consistent with the bullish news about their acquisitions and moves. This is having an effect on the amount of bullish momentum coming into the bull cycle of this price action. Technicals suggest a reverse of its downtrend from $3.70 that bounced off $2. However, for those looking to swing/day trade, it's very possible DPW is over $3 at or shortly after earnings  


I genuinely believe this stock has much upside available; not only in the near future, but the far future as well. Biden's infrastructure bill should, in theory, also be a political catalyst to the start of this stock's revival.   


With all that said, considering the good fundamentals, poor market rotation, and ability for the company to pay off debt with their found profitability, this stock could be a move for traders of all strategies to involve themselves with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvfpvr/dpw_stock_dd_bullish_for_me/

What I dont get is how the market is ignoring the YOY sales growth of 907%, in an industry that is just now becoming mainstream. $DM is trading today a little below what it was in late October before we know about the sales growth or increased demand for P-50. I can wait on Profitability, thats not my concern for a company that is in the early stages of it life cycle.

Maybe 3D printing of this magnitude is just coming on the scene so the early investors got scared with the news??? I dont see intuitions selling on that kind of growth number.

I know Tesla had a big split around 90 and then those shares then rocketed up making everyone who heavily invested early on very very rich.

Is there anyway to predict the likelihood of a split? If so how do you assess that?

Also, what happens if you own call options and a stock splits? If your call options are ITM, and the stock splits thus lowering the price of the shares does the option now become OTM?  So if you dont exercise your calls when theyre itm do you lose doubles (once one for not increasing your shares and 2 because your calls are OTM after the split?)

Finally is there any way to gauge how likely the stock is to rise after it splits? Im guessing the answer here is no and Id you believe in the company to keep buying after the split and enjoy your profits in the long run.

1,"11/17/2021, 02:36:09",Who likes Putt Putt and booze? DD or Sell?,Substantial-Issue-61," 

I have a small long position on DriveShack (3% of my account), and debating on **doubling down** or **selling.**

Main  valuation factor is new ""PUTTERY"" concept that just opened 1st location  in Dallas, TX in september.    Planning for 25 new locations in next 18  months or so.

Rest of company isn't that impressive (golf course mgmt and Top Golf copycat driving range).

**Puttery concept**  \- Its basically upscale putt putt with booze and food.   I went a month  ago and it was packed and concept was pretty impressive.   Rory  McCilroy is an investor, which is intriguing but don't think matters  much (1 win in last 5 years on tour doesn't help).

**Pros:**

\- Puttery $return per venue looks very high ($3M per venue) based on initial qtr results and projections  from investor reports.

\-  the concept itself seems pretty solid.  My experience was great.   Feedback from about 20 others was also very positive, especially from  women who went on date nights, etc.

\-  Timing to invest:  New venues opening in big markets next few months  (DC for example) so alot of potential investors will experience the  concept for the first time.   They might be like me and enjoy the  experience then realized its publicly traded and invest.     So might  pop next 3-12 months.   Or I might be the only sucker out there who  thinks like this.

\- currently  trading at a price that assumes Puttery will flop.   So if its a big  hit, then the stock might pop 3x.  Rough calculation - if each Puttery  makes $2.5M a year, then per store value  likely be around $20M per  store.  Multiple x 30 venues and your 3x the current market cap.

**Cons:**

\-  No idea if the concept will meet their projections and initial first  months results.   Investor reports seem too optimistic atleast in  presentations.

\- this company is basically a startup right now, trying to reposition their entire company.  Lots more risk here of the unknown.

\-Current CEO used to be senior leader at Top Golf (a positive), but she hasn't led any start up companies from what I see.

\- The buzz and excitement may quickly fizzle into 1 of 900 generic entertainment options.

\- balance sheet looks terrible.  Total debt and capital lease obligations higher than their current market cap.

\-They  will likely need to raise more money to built more venues with no clear  path on what the structure would be.   This means lower returns even if  puttery concept does well.

\*My position is 20k shares.    Down about 10%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qveo2r/who_likes_putt_putt_and_booze_dd_or_sell/

First let's address the basic stuff and then the **well-kept secrets.**

**basic**

Last night ser Tony CEO/Chairman/mini-Elon dropped some updates - the key points:

* manufacturing production in the US to begin before Q4 2022 (vs early 2023) &gt;&gt; sooner than exp.
* $100 million in additional non-dilutive financial incentives &gt;&gt; more cash
* targeting $100 million in vehicle orders with the states and universities &gt;&gt; would be juicy when set in stone
* cash left $414.9 million as of Sep 30, 2021

**the bigger picture**

* Canoo HQ is moving to **Bentonville** \- a city most **famously connected with Walmart.** Tony: This is an advanced manufacturing facility that will allow us to produce vehicles for unique use cases as well as accelerate our testing into gamma. Were looking for ways to take down the traditional go-to-market way and this will produce vehicles that we will sell, as well. Then during the call Canoo played a video demonstrating the progress of its gamma build, **hinting at a specific unnamed partner for which the company is producing vehicles in the US**. Canoo expects to build 120 to 150 of those vehicles, and some of them **will be** in the hands of potential **partners**"". [Read TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALpMekhyzJoLaqvSyFMsBQ7sVoiVZZaqAdFyR2OxdEvGaz6boCqNRiQL3KYZtw_JKMlNlukcf5RkXfXVPbszJtU6Gnlx7xWdBclv1jPzA-goRnQny_1X0kuYlRBY3Sz-wg39pbL1d2irsUNh587CWwtUMTDPl158Kv4pq9s0Qd86) for more details and nice global recap.
* **The short interest is unsustainable.** Depending on which provider you get the SI numbers you will find between **25% and 35% SI** on GOEV. The days to cover based on [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) are **15.5**([meaning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)). The market cap is only **$2.3bn.** Just for context LCID is $83bn and RIVN $138bn. Among the smaller EV US players Canoo has achieved the most beta testing and Apple wanted to buy them out before they went public to use their skateboard and IP as the basis for Project Titan aka the Apple Car. Shorts are cornered but they are also very strong on this ticker and will do anything to keep the price action contained.
* Today's price action is very indicative of the long/short story. GOEV opened at 8.50 just +0.05 from previous close. Then mini-mooned at 9.00 and 9.50 milestones. Obviously 10.00+ is the nightmare scenario for shorts going onto OpEx week. They will throw absolutely everything they have to keep it below $10.00 on Friday's expiry. On 1st attempt the stock managed to touch 10.01 then ladder down. On 2nd try 10.05 and ladder down. 10CALL 19-Nov has 18K open interest and almost 10K daily volume as I write. No other strike has a comparable activity.

**quick outro**

Btw not financial advice or whatever. I'm long stocks, warrants, and random calls - all ITM. I'd rather accumulate into one of the strongest IP and business plan at $2.3bn valuation and be on-board of the next moon mission rather than chase $80bn+ FOMOs near fully priced in.

TTCF Tattooed Chef ([https://tattooedchef.com/](https://tattooedchef.com/)) is a vertically integrated pant based prepared frozen food manufacturer and seller that went IPO as SPAC last year.TTCF wants to ride the vegan and frozen food secular trend. It has affiliated farms in Italy and packages food in both Italy and LA. It markets its products as healthy alternative to traditional frozen food. Personally, I dont buy into this thesis as I think the trend is for fresh plant based food. But this short thesis is rather about its short term financial outlook.

**Web Traffic Declining/Overall Headwinds**

Web traffic shows steady decline from May to August. With most of the nation vaccinated and people stay less at home and go out more often, frozen food consumption decreases. It should be noted that while TCCF just launched its DTC site, most of its sales occur in grocery stores. However, Beyond Meat saw similar web traffic decline and commented in its last ER call that grocery store sales of Beyond meat products declined. In general, TTCF is more or less a COVID play and is facing headwinds as the world slowly reopens.

**Import Statistics show non-promising signs.**

According to its [investor presentation](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb) , TTCF sources its products from Italy and packages them in LA. U.S. import data are publicly available at gov websites. There are a lot of data aggregator services available. [u/Geoffism1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Geoffism1/) found this [Indian website](https://www.seair.co.in/us-import/i-stonegate-foods.aspx) and I paid 5000 rubies to extract all TTCF import data from 2020 to 2021.

There is correlation between total imported product weight and quarterly revenue. However, Q3, TTCF saw 20.7% YoY and 33.2% QoQ decline in imported product weights. According to [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF/analysis?p=TTCF) , analysts are still expecting revenue growth to 64M in Q3. TTCF didnt provide guidance for Q3, but its guidance for year 2021 is in line with analysts guidance. This represents 56% yoy and 26% qoq growth. I believe TTCF will not be able to hit this No. Rather, it will see sharp qoq and even yoy decline.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on inventory levels and other info available in its previous financial reports, I estimate, its Q3 revenue will be 38M if it maintains Q2 inventory level at Q3 end; if it can reduce its inventory level to that at Q1 end, its revenue will be 52M. Thats 40% or 19% short of analysts estimate. If we count in the acquisition of Foods of New Mexico, suppose it contributes an incremental revenue of 4.5M in Q3, Thats 41M and 55M in total revenue respectively or 34% and 12% shy of expectation. And it is very likely that TTCF will cut its full year guidance at Q3 earning call.

**2021 Q3 Earning Call Incident**

TTCF was scheduled to release Q3 earnings on Nov 10 but [canceled it](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reschedule-third-quarter-2021-earnings-release) after bell close. This is grizzly level bear sign on Q3 earning results. TTCF has been accused of financial malpractice in reporting. On Aril 15, its CFO [resigned](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/node/7731/html) from TTCF and in the following days a bunch of financial docs had been approved and released. I noticed TTCF revised its accounts receivable at the end of 2020Q4 from 33,159K in [2021 Q1 ER](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) down to 17,99K in its [2021 Q1 ER](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) . The management is shady and a lot of investors lost trust in them.

They just announced to report rescheduled earning on 11/16 after close bell. I predict 10% to 30% fall after earning release.

Current Price: $16.95 on Nov.16 2021

3 Month Target Price: $8

6 Month Target Price: $5

**Risks:**

They may truly have a cult following of their frozen food products who are willing to pay a price premium.

They may deplete their inventory in Q3 and beat the estimates.

They may source ingredients from within U.S.A in Q3, so imports may not tell the full story.

They may announce buyout by some company during earning call.

My math and logics could be wrong all over the places (I only scored 80% in GRE Math test).

My Indian friends may not be happy with my 5000 rubies and decided to screw me up by sending me the wrong import data.

Tattooed Chef may continue to demonstrate financial geniusness in book cooking and keep the music going for an extended time period.

&amp;#x200B;

Main valuation factor is new ""PUTTERY"" concept that just opened 1st location in Dallas, TX in september.    Planning for 25 new locations in next 18 months or so.

Rest of company isn't that impressive (golf course mgmt and Top Golf copycat driving range).

**Puttery concept** \- Its basically upscale putt putt with booze and food.   I went a month ago and it was packed and concept was pretty impressive.   Rory McCilroy is an investor, which is intriguing but don't think matters much (1 win in last 5 years on tour doesn't help).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:**

\- Puttery $return per venue looks very high ($3M per venue) based on initial qtr results and projections  from investor reports.

\- the concept itself seems pretty solid.  My experience was great.  Feedback from about 20 others was also very positive, especially from women who went on date nights, etc.

\- Timing to invest:  New venues opening in big markets next few months (DC for example) so alot of potential investors will experience the concept for the first time.   They might be like me and enjoy the experience then realized its publicly traded and invest.     So might pop next 3-12 months.   Or I might be the only sucker out there who thinks like this.

\- currently trading at a price that assumes Puttery will flop.   So if its a big hit, then the stock might pop 3x.  Rough calculation - if each Puttery makes $2.5M a year, then per store value  likely be around $20M per store.  Multiple x 30 venues and your 3x the current market cap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**

\- No idea if the concept will meet their projections and initial first months results.   Investor reports seem too optimistic atleast in presentations.

\- this company is basically a startup right now, trying to reposition their entire company.  Lots more risk here of the unknown.

\-Current CEO used to be senior leader at Top Golf (a positive), but she hasn't led any start up companies from what I see.

\- The buzz and excitement may quickly fizzle into 1 of 900 generic entertainment options.

\- balance sheet looks terrible.  Total debt and capital lease obligations higher than their current market cap.

\-They will likely need to raise more money to built more venues with no clear path on what the structure would be.   This means lower returns even if puttery concept does well.

Now that I have your undivided attention, I am telling you right now this is not the nicest DD ever. I am not intelligent, but I am probably the finest copy-paster out there, and Im proud of it, now let me begin:

Ever heard of Quantum computing? Everybody is saying its the future of computers, detractors saying its full of crap. Well, whichever side are you on, or whether you do not understand what quantum computing is, hear me out. [Rigetti](https://www.rigetti.com/) is one of the few companies who dabble on quantum computing. I am honestly saying right now I do not understand what quantum computing is, but as Ive said earlier, upon looking at their [investor presentation](https://www.rigetti.com/uploads/Rigetti-Investor-Presentation.pdf) , I am certain that I will be making QUANTUM TENDIES on this one. 

This company also has the BALLS to say that they are better than Google or IBM in the ""qubits"" area (whatever that is). Either they are flat out lying or simply DUMB or they are just too awesome and confident about their company:

&amp;#x200B;

Before jumping into what they said and the potential magnitude of it, I would remind you that Rivian has about a 150B valuation on the back of 50K vehicle preorders and 100K van preorders from Amazon. Canoo has a market cap of 2B and while Rivian is far ahead of Canoo right now, Canoo could certainly be in a very similar business position to Rivian in a year's time. Yesterdays info further solidifies that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Walmart last-mile delivery context**

Before jumping into the Canoo news, I want to provide some context on Walmarts last mile delivery efforts. Generally, Walmart is making a huge push into ecommerce and last-mile delivery. They are leveraging their store infrastructure (90% of US population lives within 10 minutes of a Walmart) to enable this push. This includes the following:

* Announcement of a program called GoLocal, which for now uses gig workers and their own cars to deliver packages and groceries same day. Walmart has said that down the line they will use their own vehicles and workers to do this, but the gig worker phase is likely a proof of concept for now. They are also white labelling this service for other retailers and Home Depot has already signed up
   * [https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/)
   * [https://corporate.homedepot.com/newsroom/expands-same-day-next-day-delivery-with-walmart](https://corporate.homedepot.com/newsroom/expands-same-day-next-day-delivery-with-walmart)
* Investments into autonomous vehicle technology like Gatik and Cruise
* Investments into other last mile tech like DroneUp and Zipline

Needless to say that Walmart is making a huge investments here and is very well positioned to succeed. Their same day delivery service could have huge demand (theyre even better positioned to do same day than Amazon) and if other retailers continue to leverage their infrastructure/service, this could blow up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Canoo news and significance**

For context, Canoo has previously announced that their main manufacturing facility will be located in Pryor, Oklahoma. Yesterday Canoo announced some additional substantial things related to Bentonville, Arkansas (a city that is basically synonymous with Walmart). These include:

* Relocating corporate headquarters to Bentonville, AR
* Building an advanced industrialization facility in Bentonville, AR
* Building an R&amp;D facility in Fayetteville, AR

Ill start with the industrialization facility that the CEO, Tony Aquila, talked about. In the official Canoo press release, the company says that this facility will be used for advanced industrialization and low-volume production facility **for small package delivery vehicles in the state**. On the earnings call, Tony specified that the advanced manufacturing facility that will allow us to produce vehicles for unique use cases, as well as accelerate our testing into gamma. We're looking for ways to take down the traditional go-to-market way. And this will produce vehicles that we will sell as well. The company is pretty directly saying that they are going to use the Bentonville facility to produce customized small-package delivery vehicles to sell and this obviously fits Walmarts last-mile / same-day delivery ambitions perfectly. The R&amp;D facility in Fayetteville could possibly be used to find ways to explore combining different last-mile delivery solutions (e.g. putting Gatik AV tech into Canoo delivery vehicles and using drones to deliver last 50 feet). Then the advanced industrialization facility could focus on creating these customized top hats, while receiving the actual chassis in volume from the Pryor, OK facility 1.5 hours away. I think the fact that this facility is specifically focused on the delivery vehicle variants is a pretty huge sign and the fact that they have relocated their HQ to Bentonville makes me think theyve got an agreement in principle and its big enough that they felt it warranted relocating their HQ.

I would also add that the CEO recently secured another $350M in stock through his holding company and we are still waiting on the details of that transaction and who was involved. Given Canoos market cap is only \~2B, I would think it would be really smart for Walmart to make a reasonable investment in Canoo to secure a good percentage of the company and then announce a big partnership / vehicle order. The increase in market cap would mean that Walmart would likely recoup the cost of the vehicles and make a significant return on investment (think Amazon + Rivian here). If I were Walmart, this is what I would do.

When you throw in the fact that they moved up their production timeline and secured another $100M in state/local incentives yesterday (now $400M total), Im not sure the market is fully grasping what could be about to happen yet

The days to cover based on [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) are **15.5** ([meaning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)). The market cap is only **$2.3bn.** Just for context LCID is $83bn and RIVN $138bn. Among the smaller EV US players Canoo has achieved the most beta testing and Apple wanted to buy them out before they went public to use their skateboard and IP as the basis for Project Titan aka the Apple Car. Shorts are cornered but they are also very strong on this ticker and will do anything to keep the price action contained.
* Today's price action is very indicative of the long/short story. GOEV opened at 8.50 just +0.05 from previous close. Then mini-mooned at 9.00 and 9.50 milestones. Obviously 10.00+ is the nightmare scenario for shorts going onto OpEx week. They will throw absolutely everything they have to keep it below $10.00 on Friday's expiry. On 1st attempt the stock managed to touch 10.01 then ladder down. On 2nd try 10.05 and ladder down. 10CALL 19-Nov has 18K open interest and almost 10K daily volume as I write. No other strike has a comparable activity.

**quick outro**

Btw not financial advice or whatever. I'm long stocks, warrants, and random calls - all ITM. I'd rather accumulate into one of the strongest IP and business plan at $2.3bn valuation and be on-board of the next moon mission rather than chase $80bn+ FOMOs near fully priced in.

Shift Technologies, a newly formed company for used car buying and selling business model same as Carvana. What is the difference between Carvana and Shift? Carvana had been there for more than a decade to mature, establish its giant footprint and make the company actually net positive regarding cash flow.   


At the same time, shift technologies $SFT just established the company and went IPO like 2 years ago. They still have at least 2 years to be mature enough and show positive cash flow on the balance sheet.   


But I believe within next year, we all will see a great balance sheet for this company. The price of $SFT right now is just too good to not book a ticket for this multi-bagger rocket. This is a mid to long-term play game here. If you secure your position while it is low, you will be just seeing green in the future.

1,"11/17/2021, 01:41:34",Do we have investors in SUNPOWER (SPWR),Demas254,"announced the launch of its Virtual Power Plant (VPP) solution, enabling SunVault energy storage customers to get paid for allowing the utility to use stored energy during peak demand and contribute to a more stable power grid in their community.



SunPower Logo. (PRNewsFoto/SunPower Corp.)

During hours of peak energy demand, like a hot summer day when many air conditioning units turn on at the same time, utilities need additional resources to meet increased demand and simultaneous energy needs. VPPs can enable utilities to extract this energy from efficient, renewable energy resources like distributed solar and energy storage and disperse it among all grid-connected customers to create a more stable and sustainable source of power.
Through the SunPower VPP, SunPower will coordinate the charge and discharge of participating customers' battery, sharing energy to the utility on their behalf while reserving some electricity in the battery for backup power to the home when needed. Customers will be notified prior to discharging the battery and can choose to bypass or pre-set their system so their personal backup does not fall below a certain level. In return, customers are compensated by the utility for their participation.
""With battery storage, homeowners gain energy independence and control for their household, even as blackouts and power shut-offs increase,"" saidPeter Faricy, CEO of SunPower. ""Now with the SunPower VPP, our customers can choose to participate in programs that will help stabilize the grid for their community while simultaneously offsetting the cost of their system. Citizens and utilities working together to provide reliable and renewable energy is the future of the grid.""
SunPower's first VPP offering,ConnectedSolutions, is available to qualifying customers served by Eversource and National Grid inMassachusetts,Rhode IslandandConnecticut. Enrollment is open now and can be completed with just a few clicks.
Those enrolled in ConnectedSolutions will have the opportunity to participate during their local utilities' VPP season, running June through September each year. SunPower passes through all grid payments directly to participants, who can earn hundreds of dollars per year in exchange for allowing the utility to discharge their battery during times of peak energy demand.
State policies alongside federal incentives and falling technology costs have spurred growth of solar in New England according to the2021 Regional Electricity Outlook.ISO-NE, the organization overseeing the region's clean energy transition to ensure a sustainable and cost-competitive resource mix, leverages solar and battery storage to provide a third of the grid's power. With solar systems, batteries, and now its VPP program, SunPower is enabling more New England residents to help stabilize the grid with renewable energy.
SunVault storage available nationwide
To sign up for the SunPower ConnectedSolutions VPP, customers must have a SunVault storage system. SunVault, now available nationwide for those with a SunPower Equinox solar system, is designed to provide homeowners power to essential loads including lighting, plug loads and kitchen appliances during outages or shut-offs. Users can also achieve additional electricity bill savings by using stored energy during peak times when utility rates are the highest or selling excess energy back to the grid.
SunVault is available in 13kWh and 26kWh sizes and is compatible with SunPower Equinox solar systems. Benefits include:

Uses lithium iron phosphate chemistry designed for superior safety, longevity and durability

Offers flexible configuration; a typical install requires only two, sleek boxes

Detects utility disruptions and seamlessly switches to backup automatically

Allows customers to track home energy use, solar, and storage in one place with the mySunPower app

1. First by showing their luxury trucks and suvs that got most of us the attention( have you seen the tank turn pretty cool)
2. Delivery trucks for amazon.
Now here comes my smooth brain theory.
3. Defense contract, is a matter of time military vehicles will be electric once range, and light weight bullet/bomb blast resistance is able to be attached to a vehicle.
 Once this happens, RIVN will be a monster behemott, and who owns it, Johnny Sins Bezos, however it cant be part of AMAZON since it will be a behemoth in the eyes of the public that gobbles everything. So two things will happen RIVN will gobble up ford and be a separate entity or join companies under the Ford name, either way, I think the stock is cheap at 80-140

Wish didn't provide any exact guidance, but warned that its revenue would decline sequentially in the fourth quarter even after factoring in holiday sales. It also announced that its founder and CEO Piotr Szulczewski would step down next February but remain on the company's board.

**Rescheduled earnings:** I can't think of any reason to reschedule earnings other than the house being on fire. This is a huge red flag that entices me to buy puts by it self.

**Pattern recognizers:** Beyond meat and Oatly which both try to put a twist on traditional foods both tanked after their earnings report. Oatly dropped 20% and Beyond dropped 15% after their earnings report. The pattern is there. Tattooed Chef is trying to reinvent pizza. A lot of the thing that I said in beyond meat DD apply here.  For those who doubt that these companies have any similarities contact the organizers of this conference to give you a few hints:

**TA investor:** See the down trend in the past 10 days. Why such bearish momentum? Why big bearish bets on Nov 11th? Did someone know something in early November when companies usually finalize their quarterly numbers with their accounting firms?

**Expectations analysis:** 

They missed by a mile last earnings. This time around the expectations are the same as last time but Web visits are lower. I am also betting that their spend on promotions has increased.

1,"11/17/2021, 00:59:40",The Metaverse and why you should pay attention - Basic breakdown,RealSquishBoy,"**Introduction and what is the Metaverse?:**

As you all probably know by now the popular social media company formerly known as Facebook has changed its name to Meta. This has sparked discussions about the Metaverse and its future effect on society, and rightfully so. Although I have seen many posts online and especially on Reddit which dont quite seem to grasp what the Metaverse is and why it's the future, please note if you are one of these people dont worry - its complicated for sure! This post will explain simply what the Metaverse is and why you should get on board now. I will do my best to explain but if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments and I will be sure to reply.

The Metaverse put simply is the combination of multiple elements of technology, but put more complexly is where virtual reality, blockchain and web3 meet.

The best way of explaining web3 is to first understand web1 and web2. Web1 is what many may consider the first stage of the internet, if you look at what the first iterations of the internet were, it was just code on a screen. It was complex to use and only really used for sharing scientific work. Web2 is what we now know as the internet. This includes Youtube, Reddit etc. The main downside of web2 is for the longest time other than a domain name you couldnt own anything online. You could make a video and post it on Youtube, even though you feel you own the video and control it, Youtube at any point can remove the video and even your channel. At any point in time everything online can be controlled by someone else. This is where web3 comes in. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. Web3 may as well be called the decentralised internet. It allows users to freely use the internet run on blockchain, so anyone can participate without having your personal data involved or monetized.

The Metaverse isnt a place, the Metaverse isnt something you can touch. A big mistake I see is people think that there is going to be some sort of invention or overnight change where suddenly the Metaverse is mainstream and that's our lives, no. It will be a gradual change which has already started and will continue to the point that our virtual life is worth more to us than our physical lives.

**Why is the Metaverse the next big thing?:**

I think the best place to start on why the Metaverse will be the next big thing will be to look back at previous technology. 99% of human attention used to be on our physical environment. TVs dropped that to 85%. Computers dropped that to 70%. Phones dropped that to 50%. It's clear that as technology advances it absorbs more and more of our time and energy. At some point something new will drop that to lower and lower numbers to the point where we are using technology 100% of the time, this may take decades but it's entirely possible. 

It doesnt have to be something mind-blowing but just imagine some type of augmented reality device which either connects to your brain or you see it through contact lenses, imagine it just helped with basic everyday things like arrows on a road so you don't have to distract yourself with a GPS, or walking into a McDonalds and being able to see the calories of each food item on the menu. These are just basic examples of what the first iteration of augmented reality can do.

The Metaverse will be the next big thing because **it will be everything.** Anything you could imagine will be in the Metaverse. It can range from anything from gaming to concerts to seeing family members from the other side of the world. There is no beginning, middle and end, it's just infinite code waiting to be filled.

**Real life application and potential benefits:**

One of the potential benefits I want to start with isnt about what will be good inside the Metaverse but outside it. A comment Im seeing a lot online is people saying I want to work on fixing the real world, not create a fake one. But I think people are missing the point that this will make the real world better. Imagine the millions of cars we can get off the road and reduce pollution if people no longer had to drive to work and school, and instead would stay at home and work in the Metaverse. Of course this may vary depending on the industry but even if we could get 50% of cars off the road it would be a massive achievement.

As I write this more and more benefits keep popping in my head, I will just briefly write some ideas but it's really going to be endless. Surgeons can practice their work virtually. Architects can design and walk around buildings before construction. Home buyers can visit a home from their own home. People on lower incomes can travel the world from their living room. Schools can visit any museum. Entrepreneurs and businesses can save money on office space. Lovers of history can travel to any time desired (DINOSAURS!). The list really is endless, so I will stop there.

**Potential negatives and why it wont matter:**

As with any new technology there are always downsides. When the microwave first came out people were terrified of it, same with TV, radio, social media and now the Metaverse. I will note that is a good thing. As a society we should always look to protect ourselves and do what's best.

The Metaverse wont be perfect. Even nowadays cyber bullying is a major issue and it may not be any better in the Metaverse. We will distance ourselves further from the real world. Spending less and less physical time with our friends and family and more virtual time with them. The thing is though, the negatives dont matter. Whether it's good or bad technology has always advanced on and those who dont get on board are left behind. Many said at the birth of the internet that it would be bad but it is undoubtedly the best thing to happen to humanity in the past century, and this will have the same effect. I greatly encourage those to at least have an open mind when it comes to the Metaverse, we are on the dawn of something great and those who capitalise on it will be rewarded.

**How long until the Metaverse is ready and becomes mainstream?:**

I think this is a very hard question. Actually, I think this is an impossible question. You could try and rephrase it to How long until the internet is ready and becomes mainstream? At no point does anyone announce the internet is ready and at no point is it officially called mainstream. At some point it just became what it is.

The Metaverse creation will be gradual, it will most likely take a decade minimum but my guess is as good as yours. I think the point at which we accept as a society that the Metaverse is ready is when our digital selves are worth more than our physical selves. You even start to see it now. Kids care more about how they look on Fortnite than in real life. Teens care more about how many followers they have on Instagram than in real life. The world has and always will be  changing with technology.

**What to buy and how to make profit:**

I could list any number of companies which could make you great gains in the near future, including FB, MSFT, U, RBLX, AMZN, ADSK etc. and I would be completely wrong! 

Even though I and many others may know a lot about the Metaverse, the truth is we wont be able to predict even 1% of what the final product will be. If you asked a million people before the internet what the most popular websites would be you wouldnt get a single right answer. No one knows so anyone telling you what to buy dont actually have a clue. Yes you can make money in the short term but thats it. Remember the dot-com bubble? Watch out for a Metaverse bubble.

**Final thoughts:**

My thoughts are to tell people now to worry. This isnt some doomsday device, its better to just see it as an extension of your phone. The truth is we are years off of anything serious and no one is going to be forced to use it. I also dont see any chance of it being stopped by the government as I see some people online say. Sugar and cigarettes are bad but they are legal too. I would recommend anyone to at least try and allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to one of the bigger stock names linked to the Metaverse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvcdjw/the_metaverse_and_why_you_should_pay_attention/

Sure NVDA is awesome. They are kicking ass but quietly behind the scenes QCOM has assembled formidable product capabilities to become as well regarded as NVDA. 

Todays investor day showed just how confident the company is in its future. 

QCOM is saying that it believes that it is seeing a 7x increase in its TAM as the company successfully transitions from one trick handset pony to multi dimensional fabless powerhouse. 

Handsets is massive opportunity as they position towards android. But beyond that:

This survey is vital to our assignment and will provide valuable insight on public   
opinion of the 2001 Dot-Com Bubble. This bubble began in 1995 and the stock market rose by about 400% and crashed 78% of its total value in October 2002. This occurred due to the over-hyped interest in technology stocks which led to a higher than appropriate value and eventually a large downfall in the value of the tech stocks.

The EV space has been good for me with purchases like **$LCID,** and **$EVGO,** which has been winners for me in at **$16.89 with $LCID** and still I am doing my best to buy more $LCID. Now with $EVGO at $7.88 I just was lucky when I made the trade - so now I am holding

# I found Gevo Inc. $GEVO....

**Gevo, Inc. is a renewable fuels technology and development company.** 

The Company operates in four segments: Gevo segment, Agri-Energy segment, Renewable Natural Gas segment and Net-Zero segment.  Now this alone impressed me, I continued my research and I do use a controversial, social sentiment type methodology to justify my moves... so I first looked at the Price Targets and HOW far below their 52 week high the stock was trading..... **Here is what I found**,  

&gt;In the last 3 months, **3 ranked analysts** set 12-month price targets for **GEVO**. The average price target among the analysts is **$14.67**. Analysts compare their price target to the current market price of the stock to determine how much potential upside or downside movement there could be in the stock price. 

I began my next step of DD with looking into the brands or segments as the company calls them and **The Gevo segment** helps in all research and development activities related to seeks to production of isobutanol, including the development of its biocatalysts and production and sale of biojet fuel.  So I don't fully understand all the information I read concerning biocatalyst, but based on my controversial and social media talked about methodology, I did see a pattern in the historical data and I am looking to see a repeat in those Patterns... The company has a **Market-Cap over 1.4 Billion Right Now**

I continued my research and my reading and a couple of time needed my dictionary - and I made the decision to Purchase the stock today!!! I now know more about their **Agri-Energy segment** is engaged in the operation of the Company's luverne facility and the production of isobutanol, ethanol and related products. Renewable Natural Gas segment produces low-carbon methane from the manure of cows and pigs for the production of energy. Net-Zero segment is for the production of energy dense liquid hydrocarbons using renewable energy and its technology. Net-Zero Project convert renewable energy such as photosynthetic, wind, renewable natural gas and biogas.

Fast points

* We didn't get *huge* news.  I was hoping for something like a LOI for a e sfuture partnership that would drive a lot of hype.
* We did get *some* news.  The company is opening a new HQ in Arkansas, a new testing facility, and are continuing to hire and move forward on the plant in Oklahoma.  The fundamental bull case in this company remains unchanged, **this stock is a good buy for the long run.**
   * I hope this is scaring off the shorts
* We got a jump on the news, we closed at $8.45 and opened at $9.20, now we're around $9.75 at time of writing.  Daily high $9.97 already.
* People jumped all over contracts yesterday, and with the share price jump our thesis about ITM contracts continues to hold strong.  $10 and $12.50 continue to be the breaking points.
* Trading volume is still tight, strong buying power will continue to drive the stock up.
* Too many calls still OTM, I know it's bad value but I recommend the ""safer play"" of 7c-9c so that we have more immediate pressure to deliver on the banks.
* **1.4 million shares are ITM now bull thesis for the spike remains solid**
* **Keep Buying Shares, Buy 7c, 8c, 9c to pressure the banks.  11c to build pressure between $10 and $12.50. 20c for the lotto**

I work in small molecule drug development, trying to find new drugs for new biology to treat old diseases. It's far worse than a search for a needle in a haystack. More like a molecule of water in an ocean. Most drug companies will start by screening millions and millions of molecules followed by an intensive drug optimization campaign to mitigate liabilities like hepato- and renal-tox, ion channel inhibition, protein binding, bioavailability, etc. You often wind up (after spending ~$50 million dollars) with thousands of different chemicals from which you are lucky to get one. If you want a good example of what a very successful drug looks like, here's Lipitor:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin

Meanwhile, Cassava did none of that. If you look at their original patents from the early 2000s, they were looking for something that would work in the opioid pathway. They screened nothing, and somehow magicked simufilam out of thin air. There was no optimization, no intensive toxicology screening. No orthogonal binding assays. There is no x-ray crystal structure of where it binds. All of this to say - they have nothing. None of the data that even a first year graduate student would ask about. Just look at the molecule!
 https://www.medchemexpress.com/simufilam.html
It's a greasy little turd with more chemical liabilities than you could shake a stick at. The mere idea that this could have a pM affinity is laughable when the most potent drugs on the market are 1000 times less potent. 
Anyone with a year of medicinal chemistry experience is laughing at the suckers buying this stock.
Me? I'm loading up on puts and call credit spreads. I think this comes tumbling down by year-end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvazhy/the_case_for_sava_to_0_from_an_industry_point_of/

Lots of Apes are investing in electrification. Tesla, Lucid, Electric planes, electric trucks, etc 
Additionally our world leaders are investing in green solution, electrification of transportation and renewable energy sources to support the E-vehicles. 


Heres the issue with renewable energy; its not on demand. To account for that we need to make 30-40% more energy at all times and ground the excess energy if we cant use it. Also sometimes theres no wind or sun then what? 

Drums roll: drdrdrdrdrdrdrdr 

Energy storage! Will solve this.
The next big market while everyone is focused on electric vehicles, will be energy to power these vehicles. 

Whats the best way to store energy efficiently right now? 

-Lithium-
Problem, lithium is now being used to support our electrified transportation and other devices. We cant use tonnes of it to store energy for cities as Itll increase the competition for lithium worldwide and governments dont want for the price of lithium metals to keep rising. Also wed need cooling systems, staff on site 24/7, fire proofing the whole building, etc. Itll be too expensive for the 10-15 life itll have, at that point might as well make more wind turbines and solar panels.

So now what? Should our governments just keep funding renewable energy and always make 30-40% more then what we need? This would cost trillions extra. 

If only there was a way to store energy efficient enough and cheap enough

It has already been tested to small scales and soon itll be tested fully: (being built now)

https://youtu.be/k3fy1u7Gj1w

Best part about this, is that the energy doesnt dissipate over time.

Theres many solutions nowadays for energy storage, like storing energy using pressurized air, water reserves with height, etc As en engineer let me tell you not only is this the cheapest method, its also the most efficient. Its literally using the rotors wind turbines use to create energy or use energy to rotate. Also this doesnt need a body of water or a hill. Itll work anywhere. 


So now what. Heres tips for you to collect money to buy these stonks and finally buy your wifes boyfriend a car. 

1. Steal your wifes boyfriends bike and sell it on market place.
2. Come home early and while your wifes boyfriend is over sneak into his pants pockets and steal his wallet.
3. Walk into hipster neighbourhoods and enter sketchy buildings. Look for holes in walls and place your mouth over one.
4. Sperm bank 
5. Open a banana stand at your local AMC theatre or GME store. 

Now that youve collected money, buy the stonks and thank me in 6-12 months when youre raising your wifes boyfriends kid. 

Cheers!

WISH has about $1.4 BILLION cash and virtually no debt. They have acknowledged significant issues and have already made some adjustments with more coming. They have also brought in legit new talent (google, PayPal, Amazon, Shutterfly) with backgrounds in FinTech and product development among other specialties. They have the balance sheet to pivot and reinvent themselves. They also are still generating a ton of revenue and have a big following with one of the most downloaded apps in the entire world. 

The key is getting in BEFORE the turnaround. Earnings are next week. Im expecting them to be shit. So is everyone else. There will quite possibly be one last dump next week, but anything under $5 is a gift. 

Having said that, I also feel like last quarter was the kitchen sink quarter where they ripped the band aid off and took their lumps. I wouldnt be surprised if this rips to the upside if they have better-than-expected numbers.

If you look at the chart you can see the shares have reached a bottom of $0.65c no matter how hard hedge funds try to short it, it wont go past it. Im pretty sure the same thing is happening again although now they have 756m to pump it back well above $1 to avoid being delisted.

1,"11/05/2021, 22:35:13",TSM - Is the next large cap to explode.,X-2357,"TSM - Taiwan semi-conduxter company, is the next large cap to explode. All you ever hear about with every tech company is chip shortages, and supply issues these days. Well, what about the suppliers? 

TSM is the world's largest semi conducter supplier. All this increased demand will raise prices and it's customers will have to pay whatever tsm asks. There's no choice and the demand for technology and gadgets will just keep rising. This makes tsm have all their inventory sold before its even made. It reminds me a the gold rush, when everyone was sifting for gold, the people getting rich were selling the shovels and pans. That's TSM.

It's the perfect recipe for a huge gap up in valuation. The only possible downside is Taiwan/China tension fears, but honestly the world is too small nowadays. Everyone would lose in a ""China invades Taiwan"" scenario and I'm confident betting against world War 3. Especially not within the next 6 months. *Knock on wood*

With Nvidia's recent run demonstrating how large caps can power up, TSM looks even more undervalued right now. I'm in shares, December calls, and March leaps.

Lets push some Action on or about it. NoBrain = HugeGain",IgnitionMan,"Updated BBIG/ZASH Major Catalyst List; Momentum Has Turned Bullish as Evidenced by Double Bottom Forming on Daily Chart; All Signs Point to Gamma Short Seller Squeeze; $54+ Price Target by Spring 2022 on Smart Money Accumulation; Spinoff Dividend Shares Info Coming Soon on Form 10 &amp; PR.

First off let me address those of you who are considering an investment/swing trade in BBIG/ZASH here. Yes it's true BBIG/ZASH is better positioned than GME was before the MOASSS with Zero debt, $491M in cash, a great new CEO and two MB$ income streams. Buy, buy, buy! These crazy-oversold share prices are a gift from God. The name change to ZASH Global Media &amp; Entertainment alone is telling for shareholders. New CEO Lisa King just gets it.

If you are holding BBIG/ZASH despite some red digital ink. As a battle-tested veteran Researcher &amp; Investor, I can assure you that red digital ink merely means ""not yet"" and nothing more. Patience and discipline are essential requirements for all investors. **BBIG/ZASH has two MB$ income streams that are rock solid in LoMo Records and LoMo the incredible 5-star smartphone app + AdRizer $100M/year + revenue from multiple subsidiaries + spinoff dividend shares of Cryptyde (solid gold), so the only folks selling here are the evil SS period.** Ignore all your emotions and turn on your Mr. Spock logic, there is simply no rational reason to panic sell a $54/share stock (minimum) now, tomorrow or two years from now. Hold for the gold!

If you don't understand the delay for BBIG/ZASH audit, SEC form 10 filing, and details on spinoff dividend shares of Cryptyde, well complex audits and SEC compliance take time. BBIG leadership alerted us that form 10 filing could only be completed after the completion of the audit. It's important to read and comprehend the details in SEC filings so you know what to expect going forward. Audits are often delayed. Now looking forward, let's reference **the Japanese Candlestick Chart below where we can definitely see a bullish double bottom chart pattern has emerged** (#1 most profitable chart pattern for value investors) on the six month daily chart. **We also have multiple gaps to fill and the US markets are notorious for almost never leaving unfilled gaps - Bullish!**

Please forget about the spinoff dividend, options &amp; all the B.S. from stock bashers/fake bulls, keep your focus on rapid double-digit growth of LoMo's monthly active users, the launch in India and the opening of the floodgates for our 2 MB$ income streams. The inevitable MOASSS in BBIG will likely be the best ROI of your life, especially if you've just invested in BBIG/ZASH recently. Congratulations to all those who added or entered BBIG at these crazy oversold prices! Think back on the rapid growth of AOL, Yahoo!, Google, MySpace, FB, IG, TikTok &amp; Twtr, they were focused on Ad rev and MAU. That's where we should be focused too. E.g., 100M active users per month x 20 cents for ads --&gt; 100M x 12 months x .20 cents = $240M; at 200M MAU that's $480M/year; at 300M MAU that's $720M/year.

Now that's just advertising income for basic users LoMo users. India has a population of about 1.38B people, let's say LoMo was to capture 25% of the population as users over the next 12 months that's 345M MAU **for India alone** (TikTok is banned in India) that would be 345M x 20 cents x 12 months = **$828M** in just 12 months (smartphones &amp; social media are huge in India).

Now add in premium video editing/graphics/frames/backgrounds for $99 per year for 3.5M subscribers there's $350M/year. Add in premium ad free service for streaming at $99/year for 2M = $200M; grand total $720M + $350M + $200M = **$1.27B/year**. Multiply by 2 for **$2.54B** in 2023, 3 for **$3.81B** in 2024 and 4 for **$5.08B** in 2025 and now your beginning to see the light. However, LoMo records will be combining low cost talent discovery contests with lucrative talent contracts and we could easily see a mutually beneficial strategic partnership with Cryptyde's e-NFT for mass distribution of digital music to music lovers everywhere. It's safe to say, LoMo Records will be a MB$ business too (Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group, Warner Music Group etc. = &gt; $20B in 2020 revenues).

Did I mention that Cryptyde has five rock-solid income streams? I know for sure that two of those five are currently producing revenues Kong (streamlined cryypto-currency mining services provider) and Ferguson Containers. Regarding dividend ratio and initial value of TYDE shares upon IPO - Let's just say, it's a wonderful bonus for loyal shareholders and TYDE shares will likely triple in value during the first 12-18 months because TYDE is in 4 red hot industries and spinoffs have a long history of solid returns on investment. [Direct link to Cryptyde investor presentation.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_657f59720410cb384498d5faf58c91a5/vincoventures/db/295/2312/pdf/cryptyde_INVESTORDECK_01_Final_F1-compressed%5B64%5D.pdf)

What can we expect on valuation from the audit in progress? We know the previous valuation was \~$5.0B and since then we added AdRizer ($100M+ rev.) &amp; LoMo Records (solid MB$ potential for 2022), so I say an absolute minimum of $6.0B (see conservative revenue projections above), so if we do the math $6.0B divided by 225M shares (yes warrants were exercised proof below) = $27/share. Now because of the inevitable MOASSS my ultra conservative price target is $54/share. Remember, TikToc's revenue was $34.4B in 2020. However, there is a good chance this could culminate in a gamma SS squeeze here because the relentless evil SS show no signs of letting up.

Apparently, the evil SS still do not know what a strong, loyal and massive following BBIG/ZASH has on social media and YouTube. Nor do they know how often we share information peer to peer and via social media. So fasten your seatbelts, there is a high probability we are going for a righteous rocket ride to the Moon.

Upcoming major catalysts for BBIG/ZASH:

1. **November 3rd-5th would be an ideal time to release new valuation, dividend details &amp; payout ratio on SEC Form 10.** This will generate a flurry of good PR and articles for investors and will likely result in a gap up. BBIG will give us full details at the appropriate time via press release/SEC filing. If you're on BBIG's list of investors to email notifications, you will find out pronto.
2. LoMo Records signs their first signer destined to become a multi-platinum album selling Artist. BBIG/ZASH launches LoMo advertising &amp; marketing campaign in India and is received well with 25M MAU in first 4 months. **Short Seller Squeeze with Low Float and FOMO Starts** as all negativity fades away. **Expect significant smart money accumulation in BBIG and a perfect storm of green candlesticks for weeks.** SS fails to deliver come due.
3. [Sr. leadership executes on name change from Vinco Ventures (BBIG) to ZASH Global Media &amp; Entertainment (ZASH), which requires a new CUSIP number.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zash-and-vinco-ventures-reposition-management-teams-across-all-zash-companies-301404387.html) Thus all illegal naked SS must buy to cover to exit their positions. The required notice was already given to all on 10/20 (click on link above for proof). **Expect significant smart money accumulation in BBIG.** **Whale investor entry alert!**
4. **Many evil SS will decide to go long in BBIG after covering** to benefit from the steep uptrend ahead. Margin calls and forced liquidations will force many evil SS to buy to cover. \*\*\*Expect bullish PR on LoMo's great 20% increase in Monthly Active Users (MAU).
5. **Analyst upgrades to buy/strong buy** are inevitable as BBIG will have $491.5M in cash and no debt, new CEO plus AdRizer purchase to unlock MB$ annual revenues from LoMo. **Expect significant smart money accumulation in BBIG. Whale investor entry alert.**
6. **A large volume of in the money call options that will expire on 11/19 &amp; 12/17 will be exercised resulting in a high volume of share purchases.** Look at bullish call-put ratios - [**https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBIG/options**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBIG/options)
7. **BBIG will appear** **regularly** **on the following lists:** Top Pre-Market Gainers $ &amp; Percentage Gainers, Highest Volume Gainers, Trending Up, **Gapping Up**, Top Gainers Lists and Trading software/scanners/trader's alert services will give traders BUY NOW ALERTS. These lists tend to attract large volumes of new investors, as a result gap ups are common for equities on these top performer lists. More smart money accumulation ahead. **FOMO! LoMo has first ever $500K month in advertising sales revenue thanks to AdRizer.**
8. **SEC filings disclose major whale/institutional/activist/special situations investor's new position. Mainstream media spreads this news to retail investors resulting in multiple feature articles, bullish speculation and a gap up on daily chart.**
9. **BBIG Feature Articles, CNBC Interviews, Press Releases, Q4 &amp; Q1 ER, Good News** etc. Margin calls and forced liquidations will force many evil SS to buy to cover. Analysts upgrades and higher price targets could result from improvements in daily JCS charts and technical analysis. \*\*\*Great news update on LoMotif's 25% increase in monthly active users (MAU). BBIG press release: LoMo has first ever $25M month in advertising revenues!
10. **November 19th Monthly Options Expiration Date (third Friday of Each Month). HIGH VOLUME OF CALL OPTIONS. All call options that expire in the money will soon be converted to purchases. Expect significant smart money accumulation in BBIG. FOMO!**
11. **Dividend payment date for spinoff dividend shares of Cryptyde.** Payment date is usually about a month after the record date. This should be announced with payout ratio details in investors meeting (latest). This press release will generate a lot of new investor interest/watchers/new buyers. LoMo has first ever &gt;$1.0M month in advertising revenues!
12. One or more BBIG insiders purchase over 100K of BBIG shares. Smart money accumulation continues. BBIG/ZASH now has 5 strong buy ratings from Analysts as share price soars past $60.
13. **Press releases on upcoming BBIG &amp; Cryptyde collaborations/joint ventures with E-NFTs, LoMotif, AdRizer, Kong, Volmax, Major Social Media Co., Ocuverse etc. New BBIG acquisition announced! BBIG shares rocket higher still for new all time highs.**
14. BBIG's due diligence team makes its presentation and recommendation to the Executives and Board of Directors. **A major accretive acquisition of company in entertainment sector is given the green light and press release is issued in Q4. BBIG hits fresh 52-week high.**
15. **Tik Tok takes a major tumble in MAU in US &amp; EU on**: China CCP data collection (spying) concerns, a worsening in US/EU China relations based on more China first behavior patterns strong arm CCP tactics in Hong Kong/Taiwan, new major Chinese Co. fraud designed to rip-off US/EU investors exposed, or more stolen military/defense/nuclear/trade secrets/IP etc. US intelligence agencies already NOT pleased with Tik Tok entering US market. LoMotif gains major market share in US and abroad on favorable publicity.
16. BBIG/ZASH surpasses 2022 goal of **$1.5B in worldwide sales and &gt; 500M MAU** only 12 months after finalized acquisition of Lomotif &amp; AdRizer. Details on revenue growth and income streams attached below. But, &gt; $2/month from ad sales with 50M users is $2 x 12 x 50M users = $1.2B and that's a super conservative projection for year one folks. From there WW revenues could double for the next three years in a row via diversified revenue streams and advanced user functionality.
17. **Q1 &amp; Q2 2022 beat Analysts' consensus estimates for revenue and EPS** thanks to more new highs in MAU for LoMotif, AdRizer revenue growth and subsidiary's revenue growth. Delta &amp; Mu Variants of Coronavirus are no longer a concern in US by June 2022. Economy and stock markets continue impressive recovery despite inflation concerns and rising interest rates on pent up consumer demand for restaurants, vacations/travel, shopping, entertainment (concerts, plays, major sports &amp; movies etc.), electronics/smartphones, new vehicles and homes. Cryptyde shares have already doubled in price by July 2020.
18. **New Product Rollout: LoMo for Kids is released in US featuring super simple controls** and state of the art parental controls with many must have features for only $10/year. Now kids are hooked on LoMo younger than ever and advertising sales increase to new all-time highs in 2022 with new kids' market.
19. **Blackrock, Accel Partners, NEA, Sequoia or Bessemer Ventures proposes a $100/share offer to take BBIG private in Q1 2022.** **Offer is increased to $133/share, again at $149/share and voted down because of positive guidance on last CC and very bright future ahead** for LoMo &amp; mutual synergies from BBIG's 2 recent acquisitions.
20. **Blockbuster material definite agreement for MM$ strategic partnership is signed** that incorporates AI (artificial intelligence) into a major offering. Share share price soars to new heights on a flurry of positive press. Even now there is rampant speculation that ZASH will partner with Cryptyde to stream live concerts via the metaverse for an immersive experience anyone can experience regardless of your geographic location.
21. Jan.--March. 2023 Rumors whirl on Wall Street... Then BBIG/ZASH announces **new plans for divestiture** **with spinoff dividend shares** for shareholders. CEO is featured on CNBC with Jim Cramer on Mad Money or Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network.
22. National News: Group of well-known dedicated short sellers admit defeat losing billions on BBIG/ZASH and permanently retire from short selling after **two more well-known billionaire investors join BBIG/ZASH with major stakes.**
23. **Buyout offer acknowledged from Facebook, Disney, Sony, Apple Inc., Microsoft or Berkshire Hathaway at a mind boggling $276/share in Q4 2023**. Offer accepted. BBIG CEO is a hero to shareholders. Best advice ever: Buy, hold &amp; accumulate BBIG long term. It's too darn good to trade.

If you are wondering where all the Wall Street Analyst coverage is, well the Analysts are mere employees and they must do as they are told. It's pretty obvious here the smart money is/will be piling into BBIG/ZASH because they can recognize opportunities for 10-20 x gains when they see them. Follow the smart money...

I just get the feeling that this is a ticker that the shorts are deeply underwater on. I noticed that over the past few days the price started rising a bit earlier and more gradually than the well-known basket of meme stocks. This is clearly a ticker which the shorts have control over, for now, but the way in which they were managing the price action recently relative to the other shorted stocks caught my attention. Maybe they are concerned and didnt want to call too much attention to this ticker during the hype earlier this week.

Some things I like about the company:

*They are actually able to turn a profit.

*The recent special dividend shows me that management is willing and able (since they have earnings) to take action in the best interest of shareholders.

*Their current business model intrigues me. Chase market share and continue to do so even as rates may rise. Originate the loans but unload most of them from the balance sheet and continue to service them. Most people in the public wont catch this subtlety  thus the brand continues to grow, downside risk is managed, and the company can leverage big data from a fintech perspective to pursue new revenue streams and enhance existing ones.

*They are headquartered on Main Street, not on Wall Street. I think this brand coupled with their focus on service will sustain a talent pool and the business.

First off let me address those of you who are considering an investment/swing trade in BBIG/ZASH here. Yes it's true BBIG/ZASH is better positioned than GME was before the MOASSS with Zero debt, $491M in cash, a great new CEO and two MB$ income streams. Buy, buy, buy! These crazy-oversold share prices are a gift from God. The name change to ZASH Global Media &amp; Entertainment alone is telling for shareholders. New CEO Lisa King just gets it.

If you are holding BBIG/ZASH despite some red digital ink. As a battle-tested veteran Researcher &amp; Investor, I can assure you that red digital ink merely means ""not yet"" and nothing more. Patience and discipline are essential requirements for all investors. **BBIG/ZASH has two MB$ income streams that are rock solid in LoMo Records and LoMo the incredible 5-star smartphone app + AdRizer $100M/year + revenue from multiple subsidiaries + spinoff dividend shares of CrypTyde (solid gold), so the only folks selling here are the evil SS period.** Ignore all your emotions and turn on your Mr. Spock logic, there is simply no rational reason to panic sell a $54/share stock (minimum) now, tomorrow or two years from now. Hold for the gold!

If you don't understand the delay for BBIG/ZASH audit, SEC form 10 filing, and details on spinoff dividend shares of Cryptyde, well complex audits and SEC compliance take time. BBIG leadership alerted us that form 10 filing could only be completed after the completion of the audit. It's important to read and comprehend the details in SEC filings so you know what to expect going forward. Audits are often delayed. Now looking forward, let's reference **the Japanese Candlestick Chart below where we can definitely see a bullish double bottom chart pattern has emerged** (#1 most profitable chart pattern for value investors) on the six month daily chart. **We also have multiple gaps to fill and the US markets are notorious for almost never leaving unfilled gaps - Bullish!**

Please forget about the spinoff dividend, options &amp; all the B.S. from stock bashers/fake bulls, keep your focus on rapid double-digit growth of LoMo's monthly active users, the launch in India and the opening of the floodgates for our 2 MB$ income streams. The inevitable MOASSS in BBIG will likely be the best ROI of your life, especially if you've just invested in BBIG/ZASH recently. Congratulations to all those who added or entered BBIG at these crazy oversold prices! Think back on the rapid growth of AOL, Yahoo!, Google, MySpace, FB, IG, TikTok &amp; Twtr, they were focused on Ad rev and MAU. That's where we should be focused too. E.g., 100M active users per month x 20 cents for ads --&gt; 100M x 12 months x .20 cents = $240M; at 200M MAU that's $480M/year; at 300M MAU that's $720M/year.

Now that's just advertising income for basic users LoMo users. India has a population of about 1.38B people, let's say LoMo was to capture 25% of the population as users over the next 12 months that's 345M MAU **for India alone** (TikTok is banned in India) that would be 345M x 20 cents x 12 months = **$828M** in just 12 months (smartphones &amp; social media are huge in India).

Now add in premium video editing/graphics/frames/backgrounds for $99 per year for 3.5M subscribers there's $350M/year. Add in premium ad free service for streaming at $99/year for 2M = $200M; grand total $720M + $350M + $200M = **$1.27B/year**. Multiply by 2 for **$2.54B** in 2023, 3 for **$3.81B** in 2024 and 4 for **$5.08B** in 2025 and now your beginning to see the light. However, LoMo records will be combining low cost talent discovery contests with lucrative talent contracts and we could easily see a mutually beneficial strategic partnership with Cryptyde's e-NFT for mass distribution of digital music to music lovers everywhere. It's safe to say, LoMo Records will be a MB$ business too (Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group, Warner Music Group etc. = &gt; $20B in 2020 revenues).

Did I mention that Cryptyde has five rock-solid income streams? I know for sure that two of those five are currently producing revenues Kong (streamlined cryypto-currency mining services provider) and Ferguson Containers. Regarding dividend ratio and initial value of TYDE shares upon IPO - Let's just say, it's a wonderful bonus for loyal shareholders and TYDE shares will likely triple in value during the first 12-18 months because TYDE is in 4 red hot industries and spinoffs have a long history of solid returns on investment. [Direct link to Cryptyde investor presentation.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_657f59720410cb384498d5faf58c91a5/vincoventures/db/295/2312/pdf/cryptyde_INVESTORDECK_01_Final_F1-compressed%5B64%5D.pdf)

What can we expect on valuation from the audit in progress? We know the previous valuation was \~$5.0B and since then we added AdRizer ($100M+ rev.) &amp; LoMo Records (solid MB$ potential for 2022), so I say an absolute minimum of $6.0B (see conservative revenue projections above), so if we do the math $6.0B divided by 225M shares (yes warrants were exercised proof below) = $27/share. Now because of the inevitable MOASSS my ultra conservative price target is $54/share. Remember, TikToc's revenue was $34.4B in 2020. However, there is a good chance this could culminate in a gamma SS squeeze here because the relentless evil SS show no signs of letting up.

Apparently, the evil SS still do not know what a strong, loyal and massive following BBIG/ZASH has on social media and YouTube. Nor do they know how often we share information peer to peer and via social media. So fasten your seatbelts, there is a high probability we are going for a righteous rocket ride to the Moon.

Upcoming major catalysts for BBIG/ZASH:

1. **November 3rd-5th would be an ideal time to release new valuation, dividend details &amp; payout ratio on SEC Form 10.** This will generate a flurry of good PR and articles for investors and will likely result in a gap up. BBIG will give us full details at the appropriate time via press release/SEC filing. If you're on BBIG's list of investors to email notifications, you will find out pronto.
2. LoMo Records signs their first signer destined to become a multi-platinum album selling Artist. BBIG/ZASH launches LoMo advertising &amp; marketing campaign in India and is received well with 25M MAU in first 4 months. **Short Seller Squeeze with Low Float and FOMO Starts** as all negativity fades away. **Expect significant smart money accumulation in BBIG and a perfect storm of green candlesticks for weeks.** SS fails to deliver come due.
3. [Sr. leadership executes on name change from Vinco Ventures (BBIG) to ZASH Global Media &amp; Entertainment (ZASH), which requires a new CUSIP number.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zash-and-vinco-ventures-reposition-management-teams-across-all-zash-companies-301404387.html) Thus all illegal naked SS must buy to cover to exit their positions. The required notice was already given to all on 10/20 (click on link above for proof). **Expect significant smart money accumulation in BBIG.** **Whale investor entry alert!**
4. **Many evil SS will decide to go long in BBIG after covering** to benefit from the steep uptrend ahead. Margin calls and forced liquidations will force many evil SS to buy to cover. \*\*\*Expect bullish PR on LoMo's great 20% increase in Monthly Active Users (MAU).
5. **Analyst upgrades to buy/strong buy** are inevitable as BBIG will have $491.5M in cash and no debt, new CEO plus AdRizer purchase to unlock MB$ annual revenues from LoMo. **Expect significant smart money accumulation in BBIG. Whale investor entry alert.**
6. **A large volume of in the money call options that will expire on 11/19 &amp; 12/17 will be exercised resulting in a high volume of share purchases.** Look at bullish call-put ratios - [**https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBIG/options**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBIG/options)
7. **BBIG will appear** **regularly** **on the following lists:** Top Pre-Market Gainers $ &amp; Percentage Gainers, Highest Volume Gainers, Trending Up, **Gapping Up**, Top Gainers Lists and Trading software/scanners/trader's alert services will give traders BUY NOW ALERTS. These lists tend to attract large volumes of new investors, as a result gap ups are common for equities on these top performer lists. More smart money accumulation ahead. **FOMO! LoMo has first ever $500K month in advertising sales revenue thanks to AdRizer.**
8. **SEC filings disclose major whale/institutional/activist/special situations investor's new position. Mainstream media spreads this news to retail investors resulting in multiple feature articles, bullish speculation and a gap up on daily chart.**
9. **BBIG Feature Articles, CNBC Interviews, Press Releases, Q4 &amp; Q1 ER, Good News** etc. Margin calls and forced liquidations will force many evil SS to buy to cover. Analysts upgrades and higher price targets could result from improvements in daily JCS charts and technical analysis. \*\*\*Great news update on LoMotif's 25% increase in monthly active users (MAU). BBIG press release: LoMo has first ever $25M month in advertising revenues!
10. **November 19th Monthly Options Expiration Date (third Friday of Each Month). HIGH VOLUME OF CALL OPTIONS. All call options that expire in the money will soon be converted to purchases. Expect significant smart money accumulation in BBIG. FOMO!**
11. **Dividend payment date for spinoff dividend shares of Cryptyde.** Payment date is usually about a month after the record date. This should be announced with payout ratio details in investors meeting (latest). This press release will generate a lot of new investor interest/watchers/new buyers. LoMo has first ever &gt;$1.0M month in advertising revenues!
12. One or more BBIG insiders purchase over 100K of BBIG shares. Smart money accumulation continues. BBIG/ZASH now has 5 strong buy ratings from Analysts as share price soars past $60.
13. **Press releases on upcoming BBIG &amp; Cryptyde collaborations/joint ventures with E-NFTs, LoMotif, AdRizer, Kong, Volmax, Major Social Media Co., Ocuverse etc. New BBIG acquisition announced! BBIG shares rocket higher still for new all time highs.**
14. BBIG's due diligence team makes its presentation and recommendation to the Executives and Board of Directors. **A major accretive acquisition of company in entertainment sector is given the green light and press release is issued in Q4. BBIG hits fresh 52-week high.**
15. **Tik Tok takes a major tumble in MAU in US &amp; EU on**: China CCP data collection (spying) concerns, a worsening in US/EU China relations based on more China first behavior patterns strong arm CCP tactics in Hong Kong/Taiwan, new major Chinese Co. fraud designed to rip-off US/EU investors exposed, or more stolen military/defense/nuclear/trade secrets/IP etc. US intelligence agencies already NOT pleased with Tik Tok entering US market. LoMotif gains major market share in US and abroad on favorable publicity.
16. BBIG/ZASH surpasses 2022 goal of **$1.5B in worldwide sales and &gt; 500M MAU** only 12 months after finalized acquisition of Lomotif &amp; AdRizer. Details on revenue growth and income streams attached below. But, &gt; $2/month from ad sales with 50M users is $2 x 12 x 50M users = $1.2B and that's a super conservative projection for year one folks. From there WW revenues could double for the next three years in a row via diversified revenue streams and advanced user functionality.
17. **Q1 &amp; Q2 2022 beat Analysts' consensus estimates for revenue and EPS** thanks to more new highs in MAU for LoMotif, AdRizer revenue growth and subsidiary's revenue growth. Delta &amp; Mu Variants of Coronavirus are no longer a concern in US by June 2022. Economy and stock markets continue impressive recovery despite inflation concerns and rising interest rates on pent up consumer demand for restaurants, vacations/travel, shopping, entertainment (concerts, plays, major sports &amp; movies etc.), electronics/smartphones, new vehicles and homes. Cryptyde shares have already doubled in price by July 2020.
18. **New Product Rollout: LoMo for Kids is released in US featuring super simple controls** and state of the art parental controls with many must have features for only $10/year. Now kids are hooked on LoMo younger than ever and advertising sales increase to new all-time highs in 2022 with new kids' market.
19. **Blackrock, Accel Partners, NEA, Sequoia or Bessemer Ventures proposes a $100/share offer to take BBIG private in Q1 2022.** **Offer is increased to $133/share, again at $149/share and voted down because of positive guidance on last CC and very bright future ahead** for LoMo &amp; mutual synergies from BBIG's 2 recent acquisitions.
20. **Blockbuster material definite agreement for MM$ strategic partnership is signed** that incorporates AI (artificial intelligence) into a major offering. Share share price soars to new heights on a flurry of positive press. Even now there is rampant speculation that ZASH will partner with Cryptyde to stream live concerts via the metaverse for an immersive experience anyone can experience regardless of your geographic location.
21. Jan.--March. 2023 Rumors whirl on Wall Street... Then BBIG/ZASH announces **new plans for divestiture** **with spinoff dividend shares** for shareholders. CEO is featured on CNBC with Jim Cramer on Mad Money or Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network.
22. National News: Group of well-known dedicated short sellers admit defeat losing billions on BBIG/ZASH and permanently retire from short selling after **two more well-known billionaire investors join BBIG/ZASH with major stakes.**
23. **Buyout offer acknowledged from Facebook, Disney, Sony, Apple Inc., Microsoft or Berkshire Hathaway at a mind boggling $276/share in Q4 2023**. Offer accepted. BBIG CEO is a hero to shareholders. Best advice ever: Buy, hold &amp; accumulate BBIG long term. It's too darn good to trade.

If you are wondering where all the Wall Street Analyst coverage is, well the Analysts are mere employees and they must do as they are told. It's pretty obvious here the smart money is/will be piling into BBIG/ZASH because they can recognize opportunities for 10-20 x gains when they see them. Follow the smart money...

1,"11/05/2021, 21:37:46",I just walked in here and I'm scared,Integrationist,"Hi. My name's Will. I live in a small apartment in Charleston, West Virginia. I'm writing this on my phone while pacing back and forth in the shower. I just got through an acrimonious divorce, and 5 days ago, my wife took our 10 month old son back to her mother's house in El Paso.

My family is in Long Island. The reason I am in the middle of America's most beautiful opium den is because my grandmother left me $11,000 in inheritance and I used it to buy a small house that I was fixing up. A week before my wife left, a guy with a chad beard walked up to me and offered me 20 grand for the house. I've only put two or three thousand in materials, so that's at least seven grand profit.

I just spoke to the big boss yesterday, and it looks like we're going through with the deal. I'm a manual laborer. I don't have any assets other than about a kilo of silver in a plastic Red Robin bag that I have stuffed in the basement of the house I was working on, and a few guns. I drive a 2012 Mazda 5 that my mom gave me, and it's dirty because I do landscaping out of it. I've been keeping chickens at the house that I was fixing up. If anyone's in West Virginia and you want some free chickens, let me know.

I need to spend at least a couple grand getting my ass down to Texas ASAP. Other than that, I'll probably walk away with 17 or 18 grand. Is there any way I can log into the computer machine, go to this Wall Street Bets thing, and turn my life into something better? Who else has done this? What is this all about? I like to think that I'm a pretty smart guy, but then again I have no assets and I'm chasing my ex-wife into the desert.

P.S. I don't know who's heard about the risperdal gynecomastia trials, but I was one of those kids who was diagnosed with Asperger's and given risperdal. And I grew little man tits and I had to have them surgically removed. I just got a call from my lawyers and they said that they settled, it's been in the news.

Unfortunately, they said the settlement process can take up to a year. They are doing it through a co-counsel and that's the time frame they've been given. So for now, I just have this 20 grand minus my travel expenses as I chase my ex-wife into the arid southwest so that I can be with my son.

That's a bit of a tangent. But for anyone who is wondering, yes, I actually did have a doctor tell me that I was autistic - at least, for long enough that they could prescribe me some off label drugs! Please pray that I get a good payout for my man tits next year, if the world hasn't exploded by then.

1,"11/05/2021, 21:22:05"," Market Crash of 2021, and ""The Greatest Depression"" of 2022? ",Thump4,"***The Great Depression:***

It took 30 years for the stock market to recover by reaching the same price level as the 1929 peak.  The crash was so bad that it wiped \~90% in market cap from the stock market ( 6,030 to 864 DJIA).  On just one day known as Black Tuesday, 12% was wiped out.

[9 Year Bull Market \(record at that time\) - Up 500&amp;#37; from nominal valuations](https://preview.redd.it/emd8289wwrx71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d613b0de1c2436887244c1d7f553415ced53025)

[Bank Failures - By the end of the decade, more than 9,000 banks failed](https://preview.redd.it/jbd5uh59yrx71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23185e4217a60f1f7ec36f6736e0cf872c9ad0bd)

The failure of banks led to the reduction in spending as well as the reduction in lending.  This exacerbated the situation, leading to an prolonged economic depression.

Workers were then laid off in droves.  Repossessions and evictions were taking place, forcing people out of their property.  Families had to travel in what was known as the great migration at the time, to seek new opportunities.

Tariffs were increased to help grow revenue sources via international imports.  Yet, these tariffs turned out to restrict economic activity due to the economic waste caused by the tax wedge.

Furthermore, environmental conditions, in the form of a drought, contributed to the worsening of the crisis.  Supply chains were rattled by dought and lack of soil-preservation led to the 'Dust Bowl'.  It would take a decade for the supply chain to fully recover.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Greatest Depression***

Similar in trend, duration, rate of growth, and percentage change, the current market resembles the peak-point of 1929, just prior to the epic crash.

[Today's Stock Market - NASDAQ Chart - Up 500&amp;#37; from nominal valuations](https://preview.redd.it/hex19u7xwrx71.jpg?width=498&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e1880e3fbb03cd4ab6338e28c7b28756b53e52)

Today, we see similar conditions as we saw in 1929.  Environmental crisis (climate change and CO2, leading to global spending on these policy agendas) is leading to lost corporate profits.  The COVID-19 pandemic led to record spending via the fed balance sheet and record corporate bond purchasing.  Inflation has not been this high ""in a very long time"" as Treasurer Janet Yellen phrased it.  Unemployment is slated as being around 5% (down from 20%), yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics still uses an '\*' (asterisk) symbol to define the change (it still assumes that the layoffs from COVID-19 were temporary).  This faulty unemployment percentage is a systemic fabrication of the current crisis.

Labor force participation is at an all time high - meaning that most people that would be classified as unemployed, cannot be, because they are out of the workforce.

[https://www.cnsnews.com/index.php/article/national/susan-jones/100450000-more-100-million-not-labor-force-14th-straight-month-no-job](https://www.cnsnews.com/index.php/article/national/susan-jones/100450000-more-100-million-not-labor-force-14th-straight-month-no-job)

Estimates are that real unemployment is actually around 20%, and actual productivity from raw employment is still stifled by the unique switch to remote-only work at most companies.  Few companies are turning profits, and those who are are expected to contribute to taxes and now environmental spending on climate change.

Furthermore, we have not seen the market cap to GDP ratio as being this high.  This implies that valuations are out of ordinary.

***TLDR; Conclusions***

Today's stock market is shown to have similar numerical features to that of 1929, just prior to the crash that contributed to the Great Depression.  The economy faces similar headwinds, such as unemployment, lack of labor force participation, poor output due to supply chains, environmental crises, yet this time we also have record money printed, record valuations, and egregious inflation.  Thus, it is safe to warn investors at this time of the considerable risks in the current market.

So a good quarter overall with no huge surprises - just solid execution on the strategy. Fuel Volumes back above Pre-Covid as activity is picking up at ports and airports. Trucking fleets volumes also up and trends are moving in the right direction.

I do not think EPS number should matter to anybody at all; that is not what this story is about right now. I also do not think anybody should care about non cash impacts to revenue; these are accounting adjustments that professional investors usually discount because they do not reflect changes to underlying business fundamentals. 

BUT Here is what I think was most interesting from the call and what LT investors should focus on as signs of progress

First lets discuss downstream business (ie selling RNG to customers):

1) AMZN now referred to as anchor customer. They are basically the customer that broke the chicken vs egg conundrum that CLNE needed to solve. You cant invest in RNG upstream production unless you know you can offload it; but nobody wants to commit to RNG trucking fleets if they do not know how to get the RNG fuel when and where they need it. Bottom line AMZN is confirmed fully committed to RNG if that was not already clear from their recently published sustainability report. Heavy duty trucks with Cummins engines are rolling out now and those launched are already fueling at 85 CLNE stations in 21 states (more to come as CLNE rolls out new stations in early 2022 per agreement with AMZN). Once the full AMZN fleet is deployed 2700 RNG trucks that alone equates to about 40mm gallons of RNG demand or 40 percent of the current gallons of RNG CNG LNG passing through CLNEs infrastructure per quarter. 

2) New cummins engine is a game changer. The availability of this truck should make switch to RNG engines more compelling for trucking fleets because it delivers extra power that older engines lacked. This is important. If trucking fleets do not trust the RNG equipment to meet performance specs they obviously wont spend the capex. But power difference is no longer an excuse vs diesel engines. From a sustainability angle they are Certified 90pct cleaner than diesel! So expectation is we are going to see RNG engine commitments roll in and We need to keep a close eye on Cummins updates on RNG engine sales which will be leading indicator of fuel demand. Good news is that so far interest in the new engines has exceeded cummins own expectations and Cummins has never been more bullish on adoption of RNG.

3) New customer wins: various new transit agencies in CA have signed up for RNG fueling representing total new demand of approx 5mm gallons of RNG per year. Not huge but every customer win adds up. I wish we could see one more big mega announcement (e.g. WMT or somebody else like that) but obviously we can not know this until it is announced. CLNE is talking about the AMZN effect - basically when other big operators see what AMZN is doing and then they get fomo and jump in because they do not want to be seen as unsustainable. 

4) Existing customer wins: also encouraging is that the big existing customers of CLNE are doubling down on RNG such as Republic Services (RSG) which is asking CLNE to build new fueling stations (and supply fuel) at new locations. Impact of this is small probably but again it all adds up. 

4) Hydrogen opportunity. Not new news but CLNE announced it has been awarded contract to build hydrogen fueling station. Good news is that customers see CLNE as having expertise in building fueling infrastructure. Its almost like an E&amp;C contract where they get paid to develop a fueling station and then manage it. The company did not explain economics but clearly if hydrogen demand grows CLNE will have a new business in developing hydrogen fuel stations. The customer has ordered Initial 30 hydrogen trucks to test out. Lets see what happens. But in my opinion the most interesting development is that 1/3 of the feedstock required to produce the hydrogen for this client will be RNG. In other words CLNE is testing out how RNG can be a fuel source for producing GREEN hydrogen. If this works out then clearly there is a big opportunity for RNG to become a bigger part of the fuel mix in the production of hydrogen. Most hydrogen produced today is NOT GREEN! It is produced using fuels that have a HIGHER carbon intensity than RNG so the sustainability benefit vs diesel is diminished.

5) LNG for ships. I do not think this gets any credit until CLNE can articulate a clearer strategy around how to grow this. One hawaiian ship operator is using LNG to fuel ships and CLNE was the fueling provider. If CLNE can articulate a clearer maritime strategy that would be nice. 

Now lets review developments at the upstream (RNG production) business:

1) Without committed demand for RNG you can not commit to capex heavy RNG production. This is the chicken vs egg conundrum mentioned. But the demand is there (again AMZN = anchor) so CLNE and its upstream partners are going full throttle on building its proprietary RNG supply base. 

2) CLNE already has 4 projects in midwest via BP. Next week it will be initiating one big project in Taxes with Total. And then soon to be announced is a deal with one of americas largest dairy farms in Idaho (2nd largest) to begin producing millions of gallons of negative carbon RNG per year. Thats the quote. CLNE cant say more but you can tell this one is big. It also sounds like this project can grow even further over time because the dairy farms is going to add tens of thousands of additional cow heads over time. Its already the 2nd biggest dairy farm but it will grow dramatically which means more RNG. All of these projects are coming on in 2023+. 

3) As demand from AMZN and others increases near term (see above Upstream discussion) CLNE cannot self supply all of the demand for RNG at its fueling stations. So it has to source RNG from third parties. The good news is that There is a lot of money pouring in. Basically a lot of private capital is being deployed to bring on RNG production and while this production is not owned by CLNE they are the ones that will sell the fuel via their fueling infrastructure. The infrastructure is what makes CLNE a partner to all the independent RNG producers out there who need them as a distribution hub. 

4) To put some math around the above, CLNE is saying that it has 50mm gallons of third party RNG secured and there is an additional 80mm gallons of third party off take RNG available that it has identified.  CLNE buys this and then resells it through their distribution infrastructure. Separately CLNE and its partners BP and Total have meaningful gallons in the pipeline coming in at various stages in the next 24 months+. These numbers are as of TODAY. CLNE cant commit to any exact numbers because various projects are being identified and negotiated as we speak including the big dairy project mentioned above. But this number is going up over time and Any new projects will increase this number. Need to keep an eye on it. 

5) Maybe this has been quantified before but I think the upstream TAM numbers provided are big and exciting. Basically Littlefair provided a TAM analysis of sorts in terms of gallons of methane available for capture. There are three ways to capture methane: Landfill, Wastewater, Farms. In total these 3 sources generate 25-30 billion gallons of methane. Farms which have the lowest CI methane generate a total of 3-4 billion gallons today. But note Today the entire upstream capacity of all the upstream operators including CLNE and its partners is 400mm gallons. There is massive opportunity for CLNE+BP+Total but there is also room for other third party players. The upstream business is in its very infancy and lots of room for upstream projects.

6) CLNE is monitoring the Carbon Intensity of the fuel it sells. Right now the CI of its RNG is +30/40 because its landfill RNG but it is coming down as the company moves to selling primarily RNG is going negative. But what is important to remember that landfill gas even at +30/40 CI is around 50% better than diesel. Bottom line from a sustainability angle the RNG fuel that CLNE is selling has great CI but that CI value proposition is only getting better. That is why AMZN and others have signed up with CLNE.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnau7v/clne_key_highlights_from_the_q_and_earnings_call/

I have a (probably) very dumb question. Pls dont be too hard on me, Im pretty sure my IQ is well below 80.
So in the last year I traded my portfolio from 2.5k to 5k with relatively conservative investments. I know, small numbers, but Im only 18yo. Now I have become interested in beginning to trade options, but want to understand them fully before doing so. 
Is there even a safe way to do it with this little money? 
Lets pretend I am sure Alibaba will go up after earnings on Nov18 , so I want to buy call options ( lets say 1USD so they cost me 100USD for one warrant) and they expire sometime in early 2022.
Say the stock actually goes up after earnings by a good amount and I want to lock in profits. Can I even do this? My call obviously wouldnt be covered because 100x alibaba stock @150  would be way more than I could buy. When I would sell there would be the danger that it rises even more and I get assigned right? Meaning i could be fucked hard. But when I keep, it might fall or it will be exercised on expiration date(where again, i wont have enough money for 100shares) . So can you really only sell a uncovered call  and realise your when you are certain the stock is gonna drop? 
And when so, how do these crazy gains here on wsb like 2.5k into 150k realise their gains, lets say when GME went crazy. Surely they cant cover their calls either, when the new buyer would have exercised them.
Thanks in advance ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnasyn/how_realise_option_gains/

1,"11/05/2021, 18:01:21",$COIN will crash after earnings,kg360,"This post is in response to 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmd72v/coin\_will\_print\_at\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmd72v/coin_will_print_at_earnings/)

TLDR:  Earnings are not going to be good.

Coinbase *seems* like it would be a good play.  Earnings last quarter were huge, coin trading is hyped right now, coins are at all time highs, $COIN advertised P/E ratio is very low, etc are all contributing factors to the bull run that $COIN is currently experiencing.  Coinbase earnings are releasing the 12th, and it is my opinion that COINBASE earnings will be far lower than expected leading to a large dump.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason 1:  Coin prices don't make Coinbase money, but volume does.**  

To put things into perspective, I calculated Coinbase's  quarterly trading volume in USD.  The numbers speak for themselves. (Source: [https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange](https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange)):

Q1: $337,726,593,729

Q2: $456,237,466,410

Q3: $324,071,319,552

**Reason 2: Q2 Earnings were great!  Or were they?**

Coinbase's Q1 income before taxes was  $996,666,000.  After taxes was  $771,463,000  (-$225,203,000)

Coinbase's Q2 income before taxes was $868,881,000.  After taxes was $1,606,349,000 (+$737,468,000)

How did this happen?  Coinbase received a one time tax credit relating to their IPO.  Notice the 12% drop in income even though volume was up 35%.  Following this trend, Coinbase will need a substantial increase in trade volume to see any growth.

**Reason 3: Dilution**

Q1's earning report shows that there were 126,996,000 diluted shares (79,373,000 basic) used to calculate their EPS.  Q2's earning report shows that there were 248,147,000 diluted shares (204,728,000 basic) used to calculate EPS.  If this trend continues into Q3, the earnings per share data could be disastrous.

**Reason 4: Insider selling**

On November 2nd, the director at Coinbase sold 77,562 shares of $COIN at prices ranging from $326.28-$344.33.  The total sold amount was $25,855,002.  Insider selling 10 days prior to an earnings report is probably not a good sign.

I talked about whether the stock will take an upturn and move up or go down even more. I also talked about how Covid-19 affected Norwegian Air Shuttle and what the stock price was and how it has evolved over time. 

Most of the comments talked about how it is a shit company and it has no value whatsoever. I also got comments like Norwegian turd shuttle and that you could work at Wendys and make more money. There were also comments that they were borderline filing for bankruptcy.  I am not saying that these comments are wrong, I am just trying to prove them wrong in this post. 

 They definitely had a hard time and had to almost file for bankruptcy. But why I think that they are on the upturn is because of what happened more than a year ago. Large airline companies invested large amounts in Norwegian Air Shuttle. One of the companies that invested was the Asian airline company BOC Aviation. They bought more than 12% of Norwegians shares and at the same time a Irish airway company also invested a large amount. The Irish company that invested was AerCap.  If you want to read it yourself, here's a link:[China Becomes The Second Biggest Shareholder of Norways Airline Company Norwegian](https://www.tnp.no/norway/economy/china-becomes-the-second-biggest-shareholder-of-norways-airline-company-norwegian). This is only two of the many companies that invested but they are probably the most significant ones. The consequence of this was that Norwegian Air Shuttle was guaranteed a loan of 3 billion NOK which is approximately  350 million dollars. The loan was guaranteed by the Norwegian government and for those who don't know, Norway is extremely rich and they have no problem paying out that loan. Who knows in the future they might even guarantee new loans to Norwegian Air Shuttle. 

And now to why I think it will go up, the loan and investments were  issued somewhere between May and July last year when Covid-19 was a big problem. But now when people are starting to travel again it might become an upturn in the stock. For example, Christmas is a time where a lot of people travel and celebrate Christmas abroad. At least it's  a Nordic thing to do, for example a lot of Swedes celebrate Christmas in Mallorca (Spain). Which airline do you choose? Norwegian Air Shuttle and why do you choose them because they are cheap. If you want to read for yourself here's a link:[Skytrax: World airline awards](https://www.worldairlineawards.com/worlds-best-low-cost-airlines-2021/), before you read scroll down to the European ranking because it's the most relevant in this example. 

So do i think that Norwegian Air Shuttle will go up to 2000 dollars, no not in the near future at least. But do i think that it will go up, absolutely and do i think it's undervalued yes. But I am not urging you to invest, do it on your own risk and by your own conditions. I am just saying what I think and I am giving you the basic information about the Norwegian Air Shuttle. Don't take it as facts take it as information and speculation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qn7jh1/norwegian_air_shuttle_to_the_moonpost_2/

By Spearmint Resources November 5, 2021

November 5, 2021  Spearmint Resources Inc. (CSE: SPMT) (OTC Pink: SPMTF) (FSE: A2AHL5) (the Company or Spearmint) is pleased to announce that the application for a permit to conduct exploration drilling on the Perron-East Gold Project has been submitted to the Quebec Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks. Spearmints 100-percent owned Perron-East gold project in Quebec is located in the direct vicinity of Amex Exploration Inc. (AMXEF  USA, AMX  TSX.V) and Starr Peak Mining Ltd. (STRPF  USA, STE  TSX.V). On October 13, 2021, Amex Exploration Inc. announced significant drill results including 6.9 m of 43.74 g/t Au at Perron in a shallow hole and 28.64 g/t Au over 5 m at depth. On November 2, 2021, Starr Peak Mining Ltd. announced significant drill results from its ongoing 2021 drilling campaign with multiple VMS intersects up to 6.65% zinc-equivalent over 13.45 m, including 3.83 per cent Cu over 2.25 m. Laurentia Exploration, the same geological team whove conducted significant drill programs for both Amex and Starr Peak, will be overseeing all aspects of Spearmints upcoming drill program on the Perron-East gold Project. Previous work programs on the Perron-East gold project have discovered multiple soil anomalies and an Induced Polarization (IP) survey over these anomalies have defined the highest priority drill targets. Spearmint is fully funded for this drill program using funds from a flow-through financing of $1 million dollars at twenty cents completed in May 2021, which included a lead investment by certain funds managed by Sprott Asset Management LP. Spearmint expects to begin this much anticipated and fully funded drill program in December 2021. Management cautions that past results or discoveries on properties in proximity to Spearmint may not necessarily be indicative to the presence of mineralization on the Companys properties.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

James Nelson, President of Spearmint Resources stated, We are very pleased to have now applied for a drill permit on the Perron-East gold project in Quebec, located in the direct vicinity of Amex Exploration Inc. and Starr Peak Mining Ltd. Both of these companies have recently undertaken significant drill programs utilizing the same geological team (Laurentia Exploration) that will be conducting Spearmints drill program. This drill program is fully funded using $1 million of flow-through funds already on hand, which included a lead investment by certain funds managed by Sprott Asset Management LP. We expect to commence this much anticipated drill program in December 2021. Spearmint also expects to be underway with another drill program shortly on our McGee Lithium Clay Project in Clayton Valley, Nevada, with the goal to build upon our maiden resource estimate of 815,000 indicated tonnes and 191,000 inferred tonnes for a total of 1,006,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE). Spearmint shares this blanket like lithium claystone formation with Cypress Development Corp. (CYDVF  USA, CYP  TSX.V) and lithium prices are currently at all-time highs. We expect to have two major drill programs started before the end of the year, at a time when most companies arent able to secure one drill contractor. Spearmint currently has approximately $3 million in the treasury with no need to raise additional funds. We look forward to building upon an already active and successful year and we are about to enter a major news flow cycle. The remainder of 2021 and beyond will be an extremely active period for Spearmint with potential catalysts coming ahead on multiple projects.

Pennsylvania-based INOVIO announced that it had received authorization from the Drug Controller General of India to proceed with the Phase 3 segment of INOVIO's global Phase 2/3 clinical trial for INO-4800, its DNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19.

India's regulatory authorization in India follows similar actions in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and the Philippines.

The global Phase 3 segment of INNOVATE study will evaluate the efficacy of INO-4800 in a two-dose regimen (2.0 mg per dose), administered one month apart, in 2-to-1 randomization in men and non-pregnant women 18 years of age and older.

The primary endpoint of this case-driven Phase 3 trial is virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19.

""INOVIO is pleased to receive regulatory authorization to proceed with our efficacy Phase 3 trial in India,"" said Dr. J. Joseph Kim, President, and CEO of INOVIO, in a press statement issued on October 3, 2021.

""INOVIO remains steadfast in its mission to fight COVID-19 through the development of INO-4800, which is designed to serve the needs of those in India and beyond, as both a primary series and a booster vaccine.""

INOVIO has partnered with Advaccine Biopharmaceuticals Suzhou Co., Ltd. to conduct the INNOVATE Phase 3 segment in multiple countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.

This news builds on INOVIO's previously announced authorization to proceed in China with two Advaccine-sponsored clinical trials investigating heterologous boost combinations' safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity with INO-4800.

The INO-4800 DNA vaccine candidate is composed of a precisely designed DNA plasmid injected intradermally followed by electroporation using a proprietary smart device, which delivers the DNA plasmid directly into cells in the body and is intended to produce a well-tolerated immune response.

As one of the only nucleic-acid-based vaccines stable at room temperature for more than a year, INO-4800 has a five-year projected shelf life at normal refrigeration temperature and does not need to be frozen during transport or storage.

Furthermore, INO-4800 is anticipated to be well-positioned for a primary series immunization as well as a booster, says the company.

Therefore high demand causes a supply chain issues. However Fed can't taper printing to 0, because economy is not as strong as Jp says 
Jp said they won't be increase the rates because economy is too strong, but being not able to increase rates is a sign of weak economy.
Debt limit 30T but when the tapering finishes it will be over,
The reason why economy looks strong( increasing in employment, spending..etc) is because low rates and printing so its a bubble economy. Again, Fed can't  taper to 0 anytime soon because economy is weak. Therefore, we have couple more years for markets to grow exponentially, we known from history that inflationary eras bring growth.

1) If people are exiting and making money, who is losing money?

When I look at the holdings I see that 85% of the nearly 16B fund is not stocks, but weird things such as ""ICE SEMICONDUCTOR INDEX SWAP"", ""DREYFUS GOVT CASH MGMT"" and ""GOLDMAN FINL SQ TRSRY INST 506"".

2) What are those?

I thought that maybe the losing side is the people who are investing in SOXS (3x leveraged bear), and indeed has negative holdings of the ""ICE SEMICONDUCTOR INDEX SWAP"". but SOXS's holdings are 2x smaller in magnitude than SOXL's holdings.

3) What is the reason for this disbalance?

For what it's worth, SOXS also has positive holdings of ""DREYFUS GOVT CASH MGMT"" and ""GOLDMAN FINL SQ TRSRY INST 506"".

4) Are the diabolical gains of SOXL sustainable?

5) Ultimately, have we not seen a crash because there is an uncoordinated arrangement where people are collectively refusing to take a profit in order to avoid crashing the fund?

Among Chinese developers, the company ranks second only to Evergrande in terms of issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated offshore high-yield bonds, according to Natixis.

After Evergrand and others Chinas Real Estate takes another hit. And theyre still suffering from blackouts and brownouts (Power Shortages). Expect China to make some more noise internationally for two reasons:

1) To take the worlds attention off their economic weakness at home by projecting military strength over Taiwan and the South China Sea, and through showcasing technological achievements in new military weapons. Perhaps some additional disagreement in international talks that stall world wide initiatives. 

2) To stoke nationalism among their population to distract Chinese Citizens from economic failures at home. The more China saber rattles to rally the people the worse conditions are on the mainland.

After years of watching the Chinese economy boom and bust every 3-5 years or so its like a broken record. 

TL;DR: Think hard about the Chinese Economy before investing in Chinese stocks, or companies heavily dependent on China (Which is nearly impossible). Remember the more noise they make internationally the worse things actually are in China. Chinese initiated uncertainty is therefore an indicator of a worsening Chinese economy.

Note: Remember that Chinese Citizens are heavily invested in real estate and real estate sales are a primary source of revenue for Chinese towns and cities",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qn4m59/chinese_real_estate_developer_kaisa_halts_trading/

1,"11/05/2021, 13:34:20",$COIN is a Sleeping Titan with a Trajectory for the Moon,bryanblair4,"Alright, Coinbase announces Q3 earnings this Monday, and I couldnt be more bullish.  

To start out, the company has been absolutely printing money, with a current P/E ratio of 33.50.  If you take just their most recent Q2 earnings, their P/E ratio is 13.56.  Compare that to any other rapidly growing tech stock, Im talking Square, Snapchat, AirBnB and other popular among youths stocks with P/E ratios of 100+.  Yes, this is largely in part to Coinbase absolutely crushing Q2 earnings, but at the rate things are going, I dont think that earnings report was an anomaly.  

According to multiple websites I found with a quick google search, Coinbase is now the most downloaded app on the App Store and second on the Play Store.  Ive seen the new ad campaigns all over the place, which is always a good indicator of a company becoming more established.  With customer acquisitions skyrocketing and the cryp\*o market as a whole reaching all time highs, I see no reason Coinbase cant demolish earnings the same way it did last quarter, perhaps even harder.  But this brings me to the one critique many have of $COIN: it follows the cryp\*o market too closely.  For example, if bi\*coin goes on a run, you can expect $COIN to follow it, and vice versa.  But this isnt necessarily a bad thing, nor does it have to be permanent.

The cryp\*o market as a whole has been on a tremendous bull run since its inception (for the most part of course), and with serious attempts at integrating cryp\*o into day to day life, I dont see this changing anytime soon.  Bi\*coin has dominated the cryp\*o space, and much like $COIN, other cryp\*os have a habit of following the price of bi\*coin.  However, other cryp\*os are starting to emerge with rocketing market caps, each one making bi\*coin a smaller piece of the overall pie.  With alternative coins like  diverging from bi\*coin, the cryp\*o space is likely to become more diverse as time continues, much like the stock market is today.  This will hopefully make for a healthier, less dominated market that will be less volatile as a whole.  So if bi\*coin has a rough day, other futuristic magic internet money can cushion the blow if theyve diversified the market enough at that point.  Besides, bi\*coin, despite having harsh swings, does majorly trend upward, so even if bi\*coin stays at the top,  $COIN following the cryp\*o market might not be so bad.

So, to sum up whats been stated, Coinbase has been growing rapidly, is extremely profitable, and has been majorly underestimated by investors across the board with a track record of demolishing expectations on earnings and customer acquisition expectations.  The only caveat for some being that it follows the price of a volatile market too closely, which is hardly a bad thing given that markets history in the long term is very green, and hopefully wont be the trend for the stock forever anyways. 

But do you want to know why I REALLY believe in Coinbase? Well, put on your tinfoil hats, because things are about to get fringe.  

To start, why has Tesla recently become a trillion plus dollar company?  Is it because of their profitability?  No, their P/E ratio is over 350.  Clearly its because of the prospect of whats to come.  The eventual decline of oil as the most environmentally conscious generation grows up and the worlds energy becomes renewable.  Everyone drives a Tesla, and lives on a clean, smog free planet.  When you buy into Tesla, youre not just buying into a car manufacturer, youre investing in the prospect of whats to come, and what Tesla represents as a whole: a bright optimistic future, and a revolutionary macroeconomic change.  So, if this is the case, what does that mean for Coinbase?

Well, I can see $COIN becoming a similar thing; a stock that not only is tied to a growing, healthy company, but as a way to buy into the overall long term trend of cryp\*o becoming mainstream.  Since Coinbase is the premier means of dipping your toes in the cryp\*o seas, buying the stock means you see the value in the cryp\*o market in the long term.  $COIN could grow to represent the anticipation of the cryp\*o market growing, just the same way I believe $TSLA represents the anticipation of an eco-friendly renewable future.  In the same way, it paints a bright optimistic future: the death of banks as cryp\*o rises and everyone races Teslas to compete in the annual Do\*ecoin Cup.  And investors eat up investments that emulate a bright future like candy.  Take weed stocks, the companies arent too great in their fundamentals, but, again, they represent a bright, utopian future for pot enthusiasts: weed being mainstream. 

But Coinbase still diverts from these companies paving the way for a utopian future in one major way:  IT PRINTS MONEY.  So even if you dont believe my philosophy that investors buy into companies because of what the perceived success of the company means as a whole (bright, utopian future on the horizon), the company is still phenomenal in its fundamentals.  

Ill be watching Mondays earnings with my whole 6 shares (shallow pockets boohoo) and a bag of popcorn in hand, as I watch the next trillion dollar company climb to the moon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qn48yx/coin_is_a_sleeping_titan_with_a_trajectory_for/

I literally cannot lose, and I know that gets said alot but can someone really tell me that in about 6 months from now Apple's stock isn't going to move at all? It almost just seems to good to be true, I also thought well the profit is not great obviously because this is a very directional position wth little risk but is that's why people aren't buying these then simply just buy more contracts at the strike. Another things that seems to good is if lets say Apple's stock moves up $2 tommorow which is fairly common I can sell my position for roughly $200 already?

1,"11/05/2021, 12:12:37",Easy way to understand options.,Sweaty-Glove-718,"Background: Ive been trading options for over a decade and I have no financial or business background. I learned before it was popular online and I am self taught. So Ill be explaining it the way I was able to understand it. There are better ways, but this is what helped me. I turned $1700 into $500,000 back in 2014. 


Options are basically lay aways for shares. So lets use a house as an example. 

If you bought a house for $1M and I come and offer you $1.2M (the strike price). The catch is I have a certain amount of time to decide if I want the house. You cannot back out but Im not obligated to buy it. So whats in it for you? I offer you a $10,000 deposit that you get to keep no matter what happens. Now what? 


I hold a CONTRACT between us that costed $10,000 and I give myself 6 month expiration date to decide if I want it. So now I am hoping the housing market goes up above $1.2M so lets go over a few scenarios. 

Benefit? I profit on a $1M house as if I own it even though I only paid $10,000. 

MARKET RISES
1. The housing market goes up and its now worth $1.4M within 3 months giving me 3 more months on the contract. So the contract is worth at least $200,000 because if I forced you to sell it (exercise). So I can go around and sell the contract to someone else and say look I can force them to sell for $200,000 today, so give me $200,000 + $20,000 for the 3 months because it could continue to rise. So they pay $200,000 to receive $200,000 in equity and $20,000 premium because the contract still has more time. Meaning if the housing market goes up to 1.5M The new owner of the contract can now exercise the contract (option) and profit $80,000 or 4X their investment. 

 MARKET DIPS
2. The housing market dips and the house is now worth $800,000. I would owe you $1.2M so I just wait the 6 months and hope it rises or I sell my contract $10,000 at a loss maybe like $3,000 to someone else hoping it jumps back up. Worse case if the time comes to an end i lose $10,000. 

MARKET RISES BUT NOT MUCH. 
1. You do not have to hit the price you bet to earn money. So if the market hits $1.1M within 1 month since there is 5 months left. I can sell the contract to someone else for more now thst its more likely to happen. So I can get $20,000 even though it didnt go over $1.2M. Im selling the contract to someone else and letting them hope it goes up. 

Now translating to stocks. 

1 option or contract is 100 shares per contract. 

So if you buy 6 contracts for apple to hit $300 you have 600 shares on hold for you. Every dollar above $300 you earn $600. Because you only owe the owner $300 so everything above is yours. 


So your call is you betting it goes up, and if you do a put, you are betting it goes down. Either way you will only ever lose the initial deposit or purchase price of the contract. 

Stock example I bet Nvidia will hit $360 by feb22 so I needed to pay the owner $15 per share as a down payment. So it was $1500 for the 1 option. Now the closer it gets to the price I said it would hit the price of the contract goes up because its now more likely to happen. 

So for example if I said your house will hit $2M by 3 months you wouldnt believe it would happen so you would accept a lower deposit say $1000 now imagine something happens and 1 week later your house jumps to $1.4M. Since its more likely to happen I could sell the contract to someone else for $2500 because its not as crazy and Ive made 150% in 2 weeks. 

You dont hold a contract till the date, you flip the contract to someone else when you make money on the deposit. 

How are they priced? The crazier your bet the cheaper it is. Tesla at $2000 within 2 months is probably impossible so it would be cheap. Tesla at $2000 by 2024 is more likely so it would cost more. 

I turned $1700 into $500,000 from options at 19 back in 2014. But Ive also lost $100,000 in a day when fedex dipped when gas was low because they buy gas in 6 month intervals. So their earnings were low and the stock dipped. With not that much time left I lost it all. So if its your first time, give your self some time in the expiration date . So be careful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qn308x/easy_way_to_understand_options/

I'm pretty sure some of us smooth brains have been paying attention to the recent AMD XILINX insane pull out as a FUCKING PAIR, let me explain to you why that it is an ABSOLUTE INFINITE MONEY GLITCH. The acquisition plan for the AMD XILINX deal is set at every 1xilinx share will be converted in to 1.7234 shares of AMD, as the deal approaches closing day the price of Xilinx will be infinitely close to the price of 1.7234 times the price of AMD. that means if every single one of us keep holding Xilinx and pump our robinhood gold money into amd, we can infinitely push our net higher due to the momentum and **getting more Robinhood gold in the same process.RAP.** At the current rate of how fucking hot these two are pulling up that means the market is  ready for this deal of the century! And guess what? IT GETS BETTER. AMD currently sits at a 5.72% of float  while Tesla has a short interest of 3.73% of float. A short squeeze may not be likely but a gamma squeeze might be already HAPPENING.

1,"11/05/2021, 10:49:20",SAVA is in gamma squeeze territory if it hits $100 tomorrow,100xgainer,"I don't care about the science or the long term viability of the stock. Good luck to those who do. Alzheimer's is a hell of a disease. 

But what I care about right now is the short squeeze potential. 

Shares short as of 10/15: **9.42million, ~25% of the float.**

That's already a good start, but with the hilariously bad timing of the QCM short report and price action from 10/15 until now, shorts have likely increased their position. My guess is as they were about to release the report, the shorts tried pushing the stock below the $45 mark. It failed. Now look where we are. So not only has short interest likely increased, it increased at a very bad price for them. Many of them may have averaged up today.

Now let's look at the options market. All the weekly options from $47 strike to $80 strike just went from out of the money to definitely in the money this week. That's 25 different strike prices that combine to 15,357 in open interest. **That is 1,535,700 shares that will need to be given to deep ITM call option holders that institutions weren't likely to expect to give this week**. That represents an additional 3.8% of the float.

Now here's where it can get really nasty for the shorts and call option writers. The amount of volume of the weekly calls today, with open interest the second number (data from YF):

$80 strike: 6,373, OI: 941

$85 strike: 4,898, OI: 375

$90 strike: 6,785, OI: 326

$95 strike: 3,372, OI: 393

$100 strike: 20,803, OI: 2,245

Now who knows how much of today's volume was flipped versus how much stayed as an open position. Let's say half of the volume translates to an open interest position for tomorrow. 

Those five strikes combined for 42,231 in volume. Carrying that 50% to open interest: 21,116. Adding the $85 to $100 strikes OI ($80 strike counted in the number above), that's a total OI of 24,445. **That would translate to 2,445,500 shares needing to be presented to call option holders if the stock lands above $100 tomorrow**. 

In summary:

40 million shares outstanding

9.42 million shares short as of 10/15

Like more shares shorted between 10/16 and 11/3 as shorts tried and failed to bring SAVA below $45

Some covering offset with some more shorting today.

1.54 million shares due to ITM call option holders from $47 to $80 strike that were out of the money at the start of this week.

2.45 million shares due to call option holders should SAVA hold above $100 tomorrow

= 13.41 million shares that need to be covered or provided in some way if the SP is $100 or higher.

Shit man! I had some fucking money! I made all my losses back plus an extra 10k or so. I finally accomplished something in my life! Why would I want it to end there though? I want more. So much more.

&amp;#x200B;

Sup. Made some gains in the past two weeks.  


It all started when I heard about the Gamestop fiasco. I pretty much started investing after the larger squeeze, so as you can imagine, I ended up bagholding and lost money. Now, after discovering options, I became slightly addicted and lost around 30k over the course of the year, transferring little by little from my bank account to RH. Pic related.

Now, I am down to my last 4.4k, what do I do with it? I gamble it on options of course! Little did I know, Hertz made an announcement to purchase Tesla vehicles. I just woke up to go to work and seen Tesla was rising. Here's the purchase and sells for that.

Shit man! I had some fucking money! I made all my losses back plus an extra 10k or so. I finally accomplished something in my life! Why would I want it to end there though? I want more. So much more.  


Nvidia and SPY have been doing great as well so I started to buy calls for those as well.

Golly gee! I'm high on a rush of gambling so I needed to continue. This put me at about 60k or so total. I took profit where I could and thats the way you should always play it.

It's not enough though. We gotta keep going don't we? It's NVIDIA time!

It is now November 3rd I have around 125000 in my RH account. Lifes good, but life can be great too. Here's where I YOLO this 100,000 to nearly make myself a millionaire.

I am just blown away. If it wasn't for WSB, shitposting, losing money, I would never have made this achievement. Can't forgot JPow either. Thanks!  


p.s. My current positions remaining are 100 310c 11/5 (down 64k) and 13 300c 11/5 (put 200 order in but didnt fill) I also am still holding SPY 400 266c 11/5.  
So, in 14 days, I raised my account by 680,000 for a 17,250% gain since Oct 5.

In between all of these options I did place some which either made so little difference or even lost money but overall I felt it didn't matter to put them in. Yes I couldve held some of the earlier ones longer for a way bigger profit, but sometimes you gotta take what you got and work with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qn18wf/44k_yolo_to_720k_in_2_weeks/

Look, I get it, there are some people who have gotten rich from $GME, $TSLA or other stocks. Thing is that investing is about discipline.

What do I mean? My examples: I sold $SAVA before today's jump. I bought $EVAX this morning at first bell just to see it drop like a rock. I held onto $GTE and had to wait a long while before I got into profit territory.

Regrets? Only that I did not start sooner. Painful lessons but they're burned into my brain:

* Research the stock. Understand how they make money and their industry. Memes can help but there is no substitute for research on your own.
* Take calculated risks with money you can afford to lose. This is bigger than options. Unrealized losses are not a big deal if they are a small part of your portfolio. You may have to wait, but there is a possibility that you can make money.
* Diversification is fine, but up to a point. Diversify your funds based on past performance and your own research. You have to spend money to make money: the $GME and $TSLA winners bet big and won big.
* You will be more likely to make money if you take a few lumps and learn lessons.

1,"11/05/2021, 08:44:07",How you can profit from the supply chain bottlenecks,New_Engineer8416," **Supply chain bottlenecks and 3D Printing:**

As we start to move away from the pandemic it has become clear it left one very destructive economic issue in its wake: disruptions to global supply chains.

The rapid spread of the virus in 2020 prompted shutdowns of industries around the world and, while most of us were in lockdown, there was lower consumer demand and industrial activity hit a new low. But as lockdowns ended and restrictions started loosening consumer demand skyrocketed back up. 

What we now are seeing is that supply chains that were disrupted during the global health crisis are still facing huge challenges and are struggling to bounce back and keep up with the demand. 

A record 73 cargo ships were forced to queue outside two of America's biggest ports, in the latest sign of supply chain disruption hitting the US.

https://preview.redd.it/xmd9kdtg8ox71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7502213f7264d3a19c35aeafc1716c31bad5819e

The ships are stuck outside the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, which handle 40% of all cargo containers entering the country.

Before Covid, it was unusual for more than one to wait for a berth. The backlog is not only linked to the surging demand for imports as the US economy has reopened, but the ports are short staffed and there are not enough truck drivers to get the goods out.

This has led to chaos for the manufacturers and distributors of goods who cannot produce or supply as much as they did pre-pandemic. And amid higher consumer demand for goods that have been in short supply, freight rates for merchandise coming from China to the U.S. and Europe have soared, while a shortage of truck drivers across both the latter regions has exacerbated the problem of getting goods to their final destinations, and has led to high prices once those products hit store shelves.

The pandemic has only served to highlight how interconnected, and how easily destabilized, global supply chains can be.

Now at their best, global supply chains lower costs for businesses, often due to reduced labor and operating costs linked to the location of the manufacturer of the products they want. But the pandemic has highlighted deep fragilities in these networks, with disruption in one part of the chain having a ripple-down effect on all parts of the chain, from manufacturers to suppliers and distributors with disruptions ultimately affecting consumers and economic growth.

**Now, how can we profit from this mess?**

As supply chains have been crippled by factors outside of their control like COVID-19, 3D-printing companies are helping brands regain control over the manufacturing process.

You see, for years now companies have relied on labor located in faraway places for its affordability to make its products. And some of these products require multiple components sourced from around the world to be shipped to one place for assembly, and COVID-19 disruptions have exposed how weak this system is to disruption. 3D-printing can help these companies take back control over their production line and reduce their dependence on the global supply chain by bringing the production back home to in house facilities closer to where the end product will be. 

**So what is 3D-printing you may ask?**

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from aCADmodel or a digital3D model.The term ""3D printing"" can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified undercomputer controlto create athree-dimensionalobjectwith material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused together), typically layer by layer by a machine. 

Cool, so now you know the basics of 3D-printing, and yes, it is a thing. 

Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing has been around for several years now. The industry itself grew by + 20% annually in the period between 2006 and 2016 before it accelerated to + 25% annual growth in the last three years. The + 25% growth rate for the industry is expected to continue into this decade as the total addressable market grows from $ 12 billion in 2019 to an estimated $ 146 billion in 2030.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lp8vphwm9ox71.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9600e286407c5d120e5c49ad9a61f292c5411576

My hypothesis is that the supply chain issues will force companies to adopt the technology at a much faster rate than expected and drive innovation in the industry. And we are all ready seeing this. 

As we touched on earlier, the sectors that will be most affected by the supply chain issues are transportation, construction and autos. Now this is good because 3D-printing technology has the most potential within these sectors thus making companies in that field more open to the technology.

Three days ago, shares of 3D printing company Desktop Metal ($DM) soared 24% on a news of a dramatic expansion in production capacity to keep up with demand for its 3D printers. This could have worked as an indicator for you that some of Desktop Metals competitors might be seeing the same demand, cause today Stratasys ($SSYS) another 3D-printing company reported earnings and absolutely smashed them sending the stock up as high as +33% before closing the day at +13%.   
 

**think that other 3D-printing companies will report better then expected earnings for Q3. I have a position in both $DM and $NNDM. They report earnings on the 15. and 18. Of November.**

1,"11/05/2021, 08:40:53",Oh my gourd: N.S. farmer could hold new record for longest gourd in North America,avctl,"Gourd futures are looking up, but just like your calls missing the close by that much.

A Nova Scotia farmer has grown what is believed to be the longest gourd in North America.

""It looks like a real long bean,"" Frank Ansems told CBC Radio's *Maritime Noon* on Friday.

Ansems'ginormous gourd  measuring 3.9 metres  was grown on his hobby farm in North Alton, near Kentville, N.S.

It was measured at the second annual [Great Howard Dill Pumpkin Classic](https://gpc1.org/event/the-great-howard-dill-pumpkin-classic/) in Windsor last Saturday, and is now believed to hold the North American record.

""It's a lot of fun watching them grow because you can almost see it at certain times  grow about five, six, seven inches a day,"" Ansems said.

Ansems, 80,grew the gourd this summer by hanging it from a trellis. The weight allows it to grow faster and longer.

""I had to dig a hole in the ground in order to accommodate the rest of it, because my trellises are not high enough,"" he said.

Ansems said not much is required to grow a record-setting gourd. Manure and agricultural lime are important, but other than that it's just ""a lot of water, alot of time,alot of patience.""

Although he's proud of his gourd, Ansemsisn't celebrating the North American record just yet.

He said there's still time to beat his record this growing season, which will likely end this month.

""It's never secured until it's all over,"" he said.

## 1 inch from world record

Ansemshas been growing larger-than-life gourds for about 11 years, and setting records runs in the family.

Ansems' nephew, Fred Ansems, [set the world record for longest gourd in 2013](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/behold-the-world-s-longest-gourd-1.1872657). At the time, his gourd measured 3.5 metres.

That record has since been broken by [Goran Lazic of Slovenia in 2019](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/491257-longest-gourd#:~:text=The%20longest%20gourd%20measures%203.954,was%20of%20the%20Kikinda%20variety.), who still holds the title.

Ansems said he was trying to beat the world record this year, but was just one inch short.

""You try to do your best,"" he said. ""If I would have pollinated it two days earlier or the weigh-off was a week later, it might have made it then.""

Next year, he'll try again for the world record.

""We've got a little ways to go. Gotta get that extra inch.""

1,"11/05/2021, 07:58:37",Why this bull run is FAR from over. WARNING: NSFB (not safe for bears),josh34521,"# Introduction

Hi everyone, are you tired of being assaulted with ""MARKET CRASH INBOUND"" and ""THIS IS THE TOP IT HAS TO BE"" comments from bears every time SPY hits new ATHs? If so, this is the post for you! Here, I am going to show why the market will likely continue this bull run for at least the next few years based on a historical analysis of SPX trends, monetary policy trends, and some other factors as well. Idk how you could construe this as financial advice but just in case: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice consult with a financial advisor or do your own research before making financial decisions. Finally, WARNING, this post may trigger you if you're a bear. 

**Thesis of this post**: we may be due for a modest correction in the near future, but this bull run can continue for years to come.

# Broad Historical Analysis

We all have that one friend who's like ""bro, bro the markets are just too high like this is crazy, 4500 bro, it's crazy, bro never happened before bro, I'm buying puts bro so I can catch up on my rent which I'm already behind on because of the last round of puts I bought.... bro."" These guys suck and they're always wrong (except that one time when they're right and never let you forget about it). Well, these guys are right - the market is suuuuuuper high on a nominal basis, but when you condense it down into percentages and compare it to historical market data, this current market isn't crazy high at all.

Here's what my broad historical analysis consisted of: 

1. I divided the SPX into trending and ranging markets on the 1 month chart using all available SPX data (from about 1930 to now). This uses a log scale so that all of the data fits. The purple lines represent ranging markets and everything else is a trending market. The blue arrows are the start and end of each trending market (and also obviously the start and end of each ranging market)
2. Obviously, there's subjectivity in drawing these lines and you could definitely argue that I should have drawn more consolidation zones or should adjust my support and resistance lines, but this is what I chose to do for this analysis and I think it gives a pretty good snapshot 

https://preview.redd.it/ict2g3tt4nx71.png?width=2338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520104a4d0da59c667915a9dd11a347b479b1e3c

Now, I am going to analyze each ranging and trending market more closely and will then get some statistics to put the current run in context. Therefore, there will be 6 periods that I will analyze:

https://preview.redd.it/bexjld0kbnx71.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb116851515006215102a2e8b41688ece758b0ae

&amp;#x200B;

[\*\*NOTE: type on the Average &amp;#37; increase for this one - should be 397.03&amp;#37; I accidentally added an extra zero!](https://preview.redd.it/g546znouanx71.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ca032bc0e49bc3d8c00be852a12932700ecb171)

Takeaways: obviously bull runs are larger than trending markets, so you'd expect the percent increase to be larger (the ranging market may be slightly distorted because I used the low of 4.41 rather than a support, which would've made it much smaller, but this doesn't matter that much because I'm drawing conclusions from the trending market stats). The trending market stats are what's important here. 

The current trending market that we are in was difficult to add because it's currently happening. Because of this, I did one set of stats with it and one without. Whether you include the current market or not, it is an outlier in both calculations. When including all three trending markets, the average length is just under 15 years. When you don't include this current market, the average is 18 years. This current run has lasted 8 years so far, which is WELL below each average in terms of length. You may be thinking to yourself ""ok, well this market is just moving at a faster pace,"" well that's where you're wrong, it's not. When you boil it down to percentages, this market is also an outlier in the same way that it was length. The average % increase was 397.03% (type in the chart, I added a zero) when you include all trending markets. If you exclude this one, the average is just under 500% increase. This market has increased just under 200% so far - again making it an outlier to the downside whether you include it in the average calculation or not. 

The big takeaway from this: when you compare this current market to historical ones, 2 misconceptions should be dismissed: this current run is unusually high and this current run is too long and will end soon. Using historical averages, this run should last for at least another 4 - 10 years. 

Now, you may be thinking, ""ok nice, you just broke 100 years of data into 6 sets and showed that the market is likely to go up for the next decade or so overall, big whoop. Your analysis is too high level and not helpful because there are still bull and bear markets within this giant trend."" Well that's a good point. So, how about I analyze these smaller trends. 

# A narrower historical analysis

The above analysis is useful in that it helps you get a broad direction of the market and gauge the market's ability to go higher from a VERY broad perspective and high view. That's kinda useless to retail traders, so here is a look at market corrections in this period. Below, I have noted all of the corrections (moves of -10% or more or a period of 9 months of price down trend) in trending markets (since we're currently in a trending market, the ranging market stats don't matter to us: 

https://preview.redd.it/ndumzv99gnx71.png?width=2324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5efd4627fd7ff17d36e7d22cb5603b6de3ed48d9

Here are the stats for each of those:

https://preview.redd.it/6d0sif1tqnx71.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0785060f3b73c7f51811a4315a4d6a028a8dc8a

Takeaways: IMO this further supports the idea that there is more to go with the current market and also gives some interesting trends. First, the current average % decrease of -23.57% for this run is larger than both the previous 2 trending markets and the averages (with or without the current market as a factor). Additionally, the time in between corrections for this current market is lower than both averages (which might be weighed down by an anomaly in the first run but you get the point). When taken together, this shows that in order for this current trending market's averages to revert to the overall mean, it needs another correction or 2 that are lower than the current average (in order to bring down its average) and it needs at least time between corrections to increase by having over 22 months between the next correction. This reinforces the idea that the current bull run is not over by a long shot and still has a long ways to go. Additionally, this current run has only had 3 corrections, while the others each had 5. 

This does, however, have a less happy part to it. We are 20 months away from the last correction of at least 10%. With the time between corrections being about 24 months on average, there is a very real possibility that we could have a 10% or larger correction in the next year. To most people, that should make sense - we haven't had a correction in a while, tapering is starting, and inflation is starting to show that it might be really ugly. HOWEVER, these stats should demonstrate that even if we have said correction, we should keep going up in the future above current all time highs and should continue this general bull run for the next few years or so. 

Side note: I also found it interesting that it seems as if there is wayyyyyy more time in between corrections as time passes but those corrections are more severe. This is especially true when you take the current trending market and the 2nd one and compare them to the 1st one. Thought that was pretty cool. 

# Economic Data 

You've probably seen stats such as US Debt/GDP, Shiller's PE ratio, GBP/SPX deviation, etc. all of these stats show that the market is definitely oversold right now especially compared to historical trends. This definitely supports the idea that the market is due for a correction in the coming months but these metrics can be misleading because the US's GDP has been suppressed due to Covid for the past year and will continue to grow strongly as the months/years go by. IMO, the market jumped ahead of the economy and essentially predicted this would happen. Now, the market two must mean revert. In this case, I believe that the market will correct slightly in the next few months and the economy will continue to grow. In the long term, as I said before, the market will continue to rise, however. 

# Monetary Policy

By now, I'm guessing that most of you understand what's happening at the FED with quantitative easing. The FED is buying $200B per month in US treasuries, MBS, and corporate bonds. This lowers yields and interest rates, facilitates credit and liquidity, and makes equities much more attractive so it usually has the effect of pushing up the stock market. Combine that with the FED's extremely low (near zero) interest rates, and the market environment makes complete and total sense. Here is a chart showing SPX to the balance sheets of major central banks (does not include 2020-2021 which, as you can imagine, just continue this trend to the extreme). 

https://preview.redd.it/jsljrlm9ynx71.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f39b2453459e00c03368f39db22cb61c168cad64

As most of us tragically know, JPOW has signaled that money printer will soon not go brrrrrrr. However, this does not signal a setback in any way whatsoever. Instead of money printer going brrrrrrr it will go brrrr. Because of how fragile the economy is from Covid, the FED still wants to facilitate credit and liquidity, so it is TAPERING, it is not pulling a Canada and just straight up ending it. So, QE will now begin to taper and interest rates will stay near zero for about a year (they won't be higher than 2% tho for sure so still low). So we will continue to have a high liquidity, easy money environment again for the foreseeable future. All of this further adds to my thesis that the market may correct in the short term but has a long way to go in the long term.

# What will cause the next big crash?

When I say ""crash"" I don't mean some little 10% blip, I mean an all out tits up crash that makes you cry and even consider...... buying puts \*gasp\*. I know exactly what will cause the next crash and exactly what won't cause the next crash. First, what won't cause the next crash: what people are commonly talking about. You've heard the sayings about the masses always getting this stuff wrong (see 2000, 2008, Covid, etc.). It's pretty easy to notice this stuff too, for the past year, every time the market has 2 down days in a row, analysts call out for a 10% correction and it never happens (it obviously will at some points but I'm just pointing out how wrong they've been). Additionally, think of all the recent things that were supposed to crash the market: Evergrande, taper tantrums, inflation numbers, reverse repo (I could write a whole fucking book about how wrong people are about RRP being concerning - it's the opposite of concerning, it's working like it's supposed to, but I digress). So basically, anytime you hear something in the news or on Reddit that predicts the market crash - odds are that's not it. 

With that being said, I know exactly what will cause the next market crash: something very few people know of or saw coming. This is called a black swan event and it is the cause of basically every major market crash. 2008: most people didn't even know what MBS were let alone credit default swaps. Even of the few who caught it, none of them timed it perfectly. 2020: everyone got the warnings about Covid in January and the market didn't even crash until March. Even though people got the warnings, very few actually identified this as a black swan event (except my boi Billy Ackman). 1987: a combination of bad algos, futures discrepancies, and general investor panic to make things worse. I could go on and on. The point is, when an economic collapse happens, very few can predict what will cause it, almost now one can time it well, it's often systematic (or it affects the whole system) and it's usually from something that you wouldn't expect. So could my entire thesis be wrong because of a black swan event? Absolutely. However, the point of me bringing this up is kind of to shut the bears up: No pal, you're not gonna predict the market crash and time it perfectly, but I'll definitely keep selling you those deep otm puts. In all seriousness tho: market strong, stonks only go up, tendies galore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmybzx/why_this_bull_run_is_far_from_over_warning_nsfb/

* Stocks rose to a new high as traders reduced their expectations on the Fed's rate of tightening, while bond yields fell.
* The S&amp;P 500 was led higher by technology and retail stocks, while the NASDAQ 100 extended its winning streak to a ninth straight day, the longest since December. A positive outlook from semiconductor giant Qualcomm contributed to evidence that the industry's squeeze is lessening. Short-maturity Treasury yields fell as global investors reviewed the future for monetary policy after the Bank of England defied expectations by leaving interest rates unchanged.
* The decision came after weeks of speculation that the BoE would be the first major central bank to boost borrowing costs since the pandemic began. It also occurred a day after Fed's Powell announced the beginning of a pullback in asset purchases while indicating policymakers may be patient with rises. Interest-rate futures contracts, which had priced in two quarter-point increases in 2022, pushed the second one into 2023.
* ""We thought the amount of market pricing for Fed hikes really around the middle of next year was very full, and that should come down,"" said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Global Research.
* Saudi oil output will top 10 million barrels per day for the first time since the pandemic, according to al Arabiya TV.
* OPEC+ decides to ease cuts by 400k in December - sources.
* JMMC supports no change to OPEC policy of easing cuts by 400k bpd - sources WTI weakened
* Traders push out the first 15bps BoE hike to February, and see 1% in September.
* BoE Gov. Bailey warns on the scale of rate wagers viewed in markets.

What do I mean?  My examples: I sold $SAVA before today's jump.  I bought $EVAX this morning at first bell just to see it drop like a rock.  I held onto $GTE and had to wait a long while before I got into profit territory.

Regrets?  Only that I did not start sooner.  Painful lessons but they're burned into my brain:

* Research the stock.  Understand how they make money and their industry.  Much more important than meme talk.
* Take calculated risks with money you can afford to lose.  This is bigger than options.  Unrealized losses are not a big deal if they are a small part of your portfolio.  You may have to wait, but there is a possibility that you can make money.
* Diversification is fine, but up to a point.  Diversify your funds based on past performance and your own research.  You have to spend money to make money: the $GME and $TSLA winners bet big and won big.
* You will be more likely to make money if you take a few lumps and learn lessons.

Hi all,  


Instead of getting proper health insurance, I elected to have a high deductible health insurance policy which allowed me to contribute 3k annually into a Health Savings Account. What's fascinating about having an HSA is you are allowed to trade stocks in a tax-advantaged brokerage account. Starting in 2017, I contributed 2k of my own money post-tax, and my company contributed 1k on my behalf, and with a little as $54/weekly contribution into my HSA TD Ameritrade account, turned it to 58k! Early notable trades were $GBTC in early 2017, but I sold too soon back then. My biggest loser was $CPNG unfortunately. Luckily I jumped on the NVDA, AMD, and SQ train. +544.55% in NVDA in my HSA. Thank you based boss Jensen and niece Lisa Su!

1,"11/05/2021, 06:09:31",Stop loss. Use them. Saved me over 25% today on PTON.,Artivist,"PTON allowed me to more than double my HSA account. I was long since it was in the 40s pre pandemic and went all the way to 150+ within a year. It's a great product with an extremely high user satisfaction. They ran into the same problem as Tesla where the supply couldn't keep up with the demand. Plus, a big part of their revenue is subscription. 

So, when it was hovering around 80, I got in thinking it was a steal. However, I made sure to minimize my risk as much as I could. So, I kept stop loss just below a strong support or previous resistance (over a longer time period). And, if the price went up I would move my stop loss higher. 

Yes, there is a risk that stop loss can get triggered frequently, but I'm more than happy to sell it than be a bag holder. Today, PTON dropped 28% after earnings. My stop loss got triggered right before the big dump. Saved me a few grand. And, this is not the first time. I have had my stop losses triggered on BABA, NIO, PYPL to name a few. Meanwhile, I have had great success on others like AFRM.

1,"11/05/2021, 06:02:37",Lets talk about OTRK,Sjakek,"First off, let me say this is not financial advice. Do your own research. Dont listen to me. Etc etc. 

Alright, now thats out of the way, listen up you idiots and you savants (you know which camp you fall into).

OTRK, a company once described in these hallowed halls as having a CEO that was Jordan Belfort-Lite just released their earnings this afternoon. They significantly outperformed expectations and had better than expected forward guidance. Stock is up 25%. Woohoo.

Heres where it gets interesting:
-OTRK was down nearly 90% from their peak earlier this year. 
-But, theyve added 3 key new people to their leadership in Q3, well after they settled into the $10 price range: Mary Osbourne (CCO), Arik Hill (CIO), and Robert Accordino (chief medical officer). Short words for small minds? This is not the leadership team that the market priced in over the summer, and this is the first quarter that theyve had to start turning things around, already with better than expected results 
-This company does AI in healthcare, which is basically a Daily Double for growth prospects. Specifically, they sell a product for anxiety, depression, and other chronic disorders. Growth industry!
-There are 18.2M shares outstanding and 8.3M shares shorted. Theyre over 30% short interest, and their short ratio is 4.8 days. Shorts dont have time to get out of this thing for cheap. 
-the analyst consensus on this stock is $18 for the price target, still nearly 50% upside after the market moved on the earnings. This is a stock where the shorts are on the wrong side of the fundamental valuation, and we have a hot-off-the-presses earnings to prove it. 

Now I want to remind you: dont listen to anything I say. 

This stock has a new set of leaders, it is one of the most shorted in the market, has relatively strong fundamentals vs its price, and just had its canary in the coal mine for the short investors being caught sleeping. Now ask yourself: you getting on this sucker, or watching it ride by?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmvw47/lets_talk_about_otrk/

1,"11/05/2021, 05:44:15",SAVA is in gamma squeeze territory if it hits $100 tomorrow.,jsmith108,"I don't care about the science or the long term viability of the stock. Good luck to those who do. Alzheimer's is a hell of a disease. 

But what I care about right now is the short squeeze potential. 

Shares short as of 10/15: **9.42million, \~25% of the float.**

That's already a good start, but with the hilariously bad timing of the QCM short report and price action from 10/15 until now, shorts have likely increased their position. My guess is as they were about to release the report, the shorts tried pushing the stock below the $45 mark. It failed. Now look where we are. So not only has short interest likely increased, it increased at a very bad price for them. Many of them may have averaged up today.

Now let's look at the options market. All the weekly options from $47 strike to $80 strike just went from out of the money to definitely in the money this week. That's 25 different strike prices that combine to 15,357 in open interest. **That is 1,535,700 shares that will need to be given to deep ITM call option holders that institutions weren't likely to expect to give this week**. That represents an additional 3.8% of the float.

Now here's where it can get really nasty for the shorts and call option writers. The amount of volume of the weekly calls today, with open interest the second number (data from YF):

$80 strike: 6,373, OI: 941

$85 strike: 4,898, OI: 375

$90 strike: 6,785, OI: 326

$95 strike: 3,372, OI: 393

$100 strike: 20,803, OI: 2,245

Now who knows how much of today's volume was flipped versus how much stayed as an open position. Let's say half of the volume translates to an open interest position for tomorrow. 

Those five strikes combined for 42,231 in volume. Carrying that 50% to open interest: 21,116. Adding the $85 to $100 strikes OI ($80 strike counted in the number above), that's a total OI of 24,445. **That would translate to 2,445,500 shares needing to be presented to call option holders if the stock lands above $100 tomorrow**. 

In summary:

40 million shares outstanding

9.42 million shares short as of 10/15

Like more shares shorted between 10/16 and 11/3 as shorts tried and failed to bring SAVA below $45

Some covering offset with some more shorting today.

1.54 million shares due to ITM call option holders from $47 to $80 strike that were out of the money at the start of this week.

2.45 million shares due to call option holders should SAVA hold above $100 tomorrow

= 13.41 million shares that need to be covered or provided in some way if the SP is $100 or higher. 

=33.5% of the float

I started doing some digging and found several things about Kirkland interesting. First it's has an incredibly low float at only 13.89 million shares. Not to mention that the short interest percent of the float is  32.20%. I'm sure Kirkland may have some legit business issues going on, but come on their products sold in Costco are awesome! With such a low float and high short interest I think the potential is there. It's also just now swinging into a bullish crossover. Here are some screen caps to back up my numbers stated above.

TQQQ is a 3x leveraged version of the tech-heavy index, QQQ, containing 100 beauitful stocks. I know what you're thinking. bUt WhAt aBOuT LevErAgE DeCAy?!/1!? Leverage decay affects the slow-moving, boomer indexes like the leveraged DOW index, UDOW. Techs go up fast, and go up often. When a leveraged index goes up and down a lot, then it gets fucked by leverage decay. This is not the case for TQQQ. Just take a look at this 5-year chart. Does it look like TQQQ gives a fuck about leverage decay? 

https://preview.redd.it/jaxri19d3nx71.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91d0f9bd5890da7c0875f0dc7929da17601982a5

So not only does this index fucking move, but its actually a VERY safe long term hold. Yes, it crashes HARD when the market is doing bad, but guess what? It comes back HARDER. Like Mike Tyson did a line of crack before the 12th round, it punches past its previous high with ease. It's an index. It won't ever crash and stay down. For that to happen, 100 of the most revolutionary companies would have to shit the bed and go bankrupt. That won't happen. On top of this, the index is updated every now and then to get rid of the old boomer stocks slowing it down, and is replaced with new and upcoming market movers.

Humans are greedy by heart. I'm a greedy motherfucker and so are you reading this. I've cashed out a 500% return in the last year and a half on this bad boy. This index will allow you to get rich quick, SAFELY. Just in the last 1 month, it's gone up 40%. That's more than what the NASDAQ will do in a year. Get out of the boomer indexes, get out of the meme shit, and retards, join me and make the best decision of your life and buy this shit up. It's already passed the moon.

After earnings were released, NKLA jumped 20+% giving the company a market cap of over $6B. But it's important to understand that **the company is really only worth  $700M.** The company makes no revenue whatsoever and burns through millions of dollars every week to fund its projects.

Let's say Nikola does what they told investors and sells the 20 trucks that they manufactured to their customers by the end of 2021. Best case scenario, they are making minuscule amounts of revenue, and even if some of those sales were somehow profits they would literally still have a P/E of at least 300.

People say that them settling with the SEC is a good thing for the company but you do realize that they are still paying $100M+? Which by the way in case you didn't realize is only going to further depreciate the company because **they make no money.**

Please understand that even if they fucking exceeded every benchmark that they had for selling trucks, they still wouldn't make a single fucking dime until AT LEAST 2023.

THE ONLY WAY FOR THEM TO STAY IN BUSINESS IS BY DILUTING SHAREHOLDERS BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY HAVE NO OTHER WAY TO RAISE CASH.

That is why I am asking you, if you really want to make the easiest fucking money of your life, short the stock. IT IS UP 30% THIS MONTH OFF OF NOTHING RELATED TO FUNDAMENTALS.

Open Lending specializes in Loan software specifically for automobiles. They help their customers know which of you retards will actually pay them back if they are dumb enough to loan you money. This is exactly what $UPST did but for Personal Loans and look how that stock has done the past year. This stock is literally the perfect kindle just sitting there ready to get lit and blow up just in time for you to buy your ex wife a Christmas present  

Now lets look at the Numbers. $LPRO IPOd last year and has had 6 consecutive quarters of beating analyst estimates on Revenue and EPS and is on track to beat next week 11/9 for their next earnings. They are ALREADY a profitable company and brought in $60M last quarter which comes out to ~$250M FY. Let me remind you the market cap is only $4.2bn right now. $UPST is $25 and got as high as $35Bn. Thats a 10x bagger right there. 

Heres the fun part. The Option Chains havent been touched for the next ER and if they blow out earnings and get more volume, this thing is a powder keg ready to give all of you a 10x+ bagger. Ive specifically added some Dec $35 and $40 calls and looking to add to my position tomorrow. 

Let this be the stock you actually got into early and not be chasing it when its $100+ by next year. AI is the future and $LPRO is capitalizing on it in the automobile Loan sector. Cash cow baby, suck on them tiddies. Hopefully your wife lets you suck on hers after you multi bag off this gem. 

TLDR: $LPRO is an untouched gem and at the forefront of AI loans for automobiles AKA next $UPST

So Zillow just Lehman'd itself in absolutely dramatic fashion and now Gen Z'ers who did not live through the Great Financial Crisis are all bears on leveraged housing speculation...yet you YOLO weekly options.  I get it, inconsistency is cool.  Let's review $OPEN to understand whether it's the next victim in this 'house of cards' or whether it is a good investment opportunity.

I present to you:  $OPEN:  Not the POS You Think It Is.  

Zillow blew itself up because it was using Zestimates to compete with Open Door.  Now it is having a fire sale of all the houses it over paid for.  The market believes $OPEN is next.  I believe $OPEN in fact now has an OPEN LANE without meaningful competition 

&amp;#x200B;

**So what is $OPEN?**    

Opendoor (OPEN) is a digital platform for residential real estate. Founded in 2014, OPEN sought to reinvent one of lifes most important transactions that has been stuck in the past with high-cost, inconvenient, and burdensome costs to the consumer. Importantly, the traditional real estate industry leaves homeowners often stuck in the lurch  not able to move without first selling their house. Each housing transaction depends on the cooperation of several parties, any of which can delay or break a deal. Real estate desperately needs a market maker to provide liquidity to homeowners and decrease the market friction. 

**Why do we care?**

The market is huge**:** In an average year, 5.6MM homes in the U.S. are sold, equating to \~$2TN in transactions. The market is huge, highly fragmented, and ripe for disruption.   Key to disruption is whether something is materially better than the existing solution, and/or materially changes the economics. The existing model requires a seller to hire an agent, pay to ready the house for sale (staging, repairs, etc), list the house and bear the carrying costs and uncertainty, host open houses, assume deal risk, wait for close etc. A subsequent house purchase might then require a contingency on selling the original house, significantly limiting the ability of the buyer to close on the new house. It is hard and expensive to be double long real estate. 

**How is iBuying positioned?**

iBuying allows a seller to transfer the risk, cost, and time required for a typical sale to the intermediary, in this case, OPEN. Like any market maker, OPEN is a central warehouse of risk and across a portfolio, should be the efficient low-cost provider vs. the risk laying with each individual seller. Despite having obvious economics of scale that make the model attractive to the seller, iBuying is also a luxury service that adds to any cost efficiencies that an aggregator can achieve

**DETAILS THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION:** In the spirt of keeping this short, let me just share a few things that stuck out to me as I researched the Company:

 **LOW COST PLATFORM:** From inception, $OPEN has been focused on being the lowest cost platform and invested heavily to build for scale, centralization, and automation

 **BRAND:** Crucial to being a low cost platform is having a brand. Similar to $CVNAs brand, $OPEN is showing signs of successful brand building, with a significant increase in direct traffic. An analysis of web traffic shows encouraging signs that while on a smaller absolute scale than $Zs web traffic, shows a lot of direct search and organic traffic

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j85sktewomx71.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b7bd04c189451710d11c0384d48b29cf4c8a7b1

https://preview.redd.it/pb021taxomx71.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=148931bd67b62dac91d5d0f4a68a4637184bb327

 **TWO-WAY FLOW / MATCHING:** Being able to self-clear on your market place gives huge advantages. Currently, OPEN is able to sell one house out of every two houses it buys to intern flow. This gives increased efficiency to the platform b/c more fees are avoided

 **UNFAIR ADVANTAGE:** While I initially thought $Z had the advantage at what usually matters the most  attracting customers at the lowest cost, it turns out that $OPEN in fact has the advantage. Why? $OPEN was built for one purpose  iBuying. It has become very good at attracting and targeting high-intent sellers. $Z was built to generate leads for brokers. While they have great top of funnel, are those users looking for an offer on their home? $OPEN was able to purpose-build the platform for one thing, and has built a lead in acquiring home sellers, at pricing homes, and managing risk. Zillow, by contrast, is an agent marketing product and had committed to agents that they would not be brokers. $Z is paying agent commissions on all 4 legs of the 2 sides of the iBuying transaction, which is a larger burden than what $OPEN pays, which is only the last leg of the transaction for the buyers broker. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 5s6f4vsiqmx71...*

 **ACCUMULATION BENEFIT:** It turns out that being in the market matters. With volume and transaction history, $OPEN has shown an ability to price risk more effectively. Its important to understand when scale conveys an accumulated benefit to a player. It appears to be the case in iBuying where better data is accumulated based on cumulative scale and transaction volume on a local level. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0pb62uczomx71.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe59d031b39b89c3870627b091c30f0509c4b277

 **PRODUCT ROADMAP:** The iBuying transaction is a pathway to attaching to many high value products. By owning the home sale transaction, $OPEN is in a position to offer title, mortgage, home renovations, home warranty, etc and significantly improve the economics that we see today

 **PLATFORM:**  We are also seeing $OPEN become the scale platform for home builders as a channel for inventory distribution (Lennar is an investor and uses them to sell homes) as well as an acquisition platform for REITs.  This is similar in a way to $CVNA's deal with Hertz.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zdz926t6pmx71.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4f947401d065e50e32a3b67883718b2675993ee

Here is a smart thing I found during my research that summarizes a lot of these points, but also contextualizes the opportunity

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/91p5cgxuomx71.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa010be4d96a8ff82fa00263c47fb2520080d93f

**Now here's what matters.  The math!**

What do we want?  A few things:

&amp;#x200B;

* Good unit economics:  OPEN makes \~$30K on each sale and spends \~$8k to acquire each house.  This has continued to trend up, admittedly with some tailwinds from home price appreciation.  But, OPEN will be able to monetize better in the future as it attaches more products
* Scalability:  OPEN has been able to scale the number of houses it buys with a cost per acquired house that goes DOWN.  Why?  It's building a brand.  OPEN has organic traffic.  This is crucial. 
* Operating leverage:  With incremental contribution margin, fixed costs (Ex. stock comp) has been stable.  As OPEN scales, cash flow will surge

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jasna4ncpmx71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3b22245928dd00d03705db5eb6356f882e3848

**CONCLUSION:**  The stable CAC per house bought, the 60% growth rate, the clear contribution margin spread over fixed costs, and accumulation benefit of data, and the purpose-built unfair advantage are enough for me to conclude that [$OPEN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24OPEN&amp;src=cashtag_click) might not be the POS you think it is 

Oh, PS, the co-founder accidently tweeted that the company was going to crush Q3 numbers last night when he was in a twitter war :)

The basic issue is that right now everything is dumb. You can complain about that, or you can embrace it. In investing in 2021, my channel checks and fundamental modeling suggest that this company will grow earnings faster than the market expects so I will buy it with a price target 20% above todays price might sound smarter than this companys chief executive officer just tweeted a picture of a dog at Elon Musk so Im going to buy out-of-the-money call options expiring Friday because the stock will go up 200% today, but the latter approach happens to work better right now. 

This is all well and good if youre a retail investor on Reddit; you just buy the right memes at the right time and get rich. (This is really, really not investing advice!) You are essentially a passive observer; your job is to notice which companies are doing the dumbest things and then buy them. (Read the previous parenthetical!)

But other people are active participants in this dumb economy and can nudge companies to be dumber so their stocks will go up. This most obviously works for the chief executive officers of companies. If you are the CEO of a public company, I want you to consider very seriously going to an investment conference with no pants on. Your stock will go up, your shareholders will be happy and your cost of financing will go down. Why would my stock go up because I dont wear pants, you ask me, and I say, shh, shh, it just will, dont ask why. I have my dignity, I am not going to go to an important business conference with no pants on just to amuse some apes on Reddit, you say, and I say: You are not as committed to maximizing shareholder value as I thought you were.

My problem is living in a country struggling with high inflation. The dollar and euro exchange rates are also increasing day by day. I can't save money. I cannot invest in anything. I have the knowledge to start my own business. But I can't do that either due to high loan interest rates.

 I can't even afford a $5,000 crappy car, even though I've been working day and night non-stop. The money I work for goes only to food and rent. Car prices are also constantly increasing. Since I don't have a car, I have to get up at 5 o'clock every day.

 Many of my friends have gone to work in other countries. That doesn't seem like an honorable thing to me. It doesn't suit me. I tried Dropshipping to earn dollars. Since I don't have much money to use, my income was also low. It wasn't worth the time I spent. I tried to work freelance. but then I can't spare time for my work place. 

&amp;#x200B;

How does a salaried employee deal with high inflation? Can high inflation be used wisely? When I researched, I saw that some people said that in high inflation, it is necessary to borrow on credit. But how can you borrow money if you don't already have money to pay?  

 I don't think I will live like this for the rest of my life. It does not seem that the inflation problem in my country can be solved in the short term. Do you know a source that I can read and follow on this subject? Or do you have a suggestion?

# Introduction

Robinhood sucks, we can all agree on that. They're restricting users from buying stocks or just take their money right away. Yet, many users still use it and keep complaining about it. There are many alternatives, but even some of them block stocks like GME or AMC. Currently, If you don't want to use Robinhood, you have to constantly switch and deal with other issues.

# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

The reason the platforms are able to restrict users from buying certain stocks, is because they're centralized and custodial. Decentralized Finance is based on cryptocurrencies, but is not limited to them. Decentralized Finance is not controlled by anyone. No one can block buying stocks, even if they wanted to. Even the Government. Of course it's completely safe and legal.

# Terra &amp; Mirror Protocol

Terra is a Smart Contract platform. Smart Contracts are like decentralized servers that can run any code. Mirror Protocol is one of them smart contracts, which adds lots of additional stablecoins not available natively on Terra. Those stablecoins include **tokens pegged to values of stocks**.

You can use it to trade, transfer, borrow and lend stocks, with a small fee of 0.1%.

# How?

First of all, I recommend you to [learn about Terra](https://www.reddit.com/r/terraluna/comments/p8m4s1/terra_is_an_ecosystem_of_stablecoins_and_this_is/) and optionally [Mirror Protocol](https://docs.mirror.finance/) before you start.

Once you do that, you need to convert some money to UST, it's a dollar stablecoin. You won't have to interact with any cryptocurrency assets. I'm not going to recommend you any ways, but it's pretty easy, just google it.

To trade stocks, you go to [https://terra.mirror.finance/](https://terra.mirror.finance/) and that's it. It's that easy.

**This DD is my own analysis. I put my money where my mouth is but this is definitely not financial advice. Do your own DD.**

There is a lot of speculation going around IPOF and it's possible targets, so I'll try to go over the recent events, filings and news in order to give you a better insight into the company. I'm also going to explain the research that I've done and how I discovered that IPOF is currently very undervalued.

I will also attach links to the news sources and videos where I got my information from.

&amp;#x200B;

* **1. Intro**

A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is a company that has no commercial operations and is formed strictly to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company.

IPOF is a SPAC with over $1B in it's trust. This makes it Chamath's largest possible deal in terms of funds.

https://preview.redd.it/uio5jovnfmx71.png?width=2158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14e7986c475ca423526e9966dccf7fb474d5799

SPACs that are trading at NAV (10$ in our case) have a very limited downside and unlimited upside potential. If no deal is struck, all shareholders will be reimbursed the initial $10 after the deadline is over. Now, the most painful part about betting on a SPAC is that you never know when a deal is announced.

It is currently trading at $10.25. At this price, you're risking 0.25$ for what I deemed earlier as unlimited upside potential.

Another thing to consider is the recent cash burn in IPOF (2.15 million), also followed by a recent[8-K filing for a $2.5m loan](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-122014/) (which could be to pay for the lawyer fees and everything involved in the process of releasing the Definitive Agreement).

(NOTE: nobody knows when the DA could be announced, they can release it tomorrow or it can take another 3 months)

&amp;#x200B;

* **2. Recent events in the SPAC market**

We have all seen what happened to DWAC two weeks ago. Luckily, Trump more or less reignited the SPAC flame that was dying out. Now suddenly SPACs started flying left and right. With an eye back on SPACs, a lot of people seem to have overlooked IPOF, as it's share price barely moved.

I will get into detail in the next part of this DD on how IPOF could be attached to Elon Musks name and how early we are at what could possibly a subsidiary of SpaceX (Starlink) being brought out to the public.

Chamath's reputation in the SPAC world is very well known, and [he knows it too](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1449152491665297409). He has been hinting at something big coming up but we might not have realized how big it possibly could be.

&amp;#x200B;

* **3. Possible targets**

This part is pure speculation. We're going to take a look at all the possible targets and the rumors that have circulated in the past couple of months.

# Impossible Foods

Impossible Foods is currently going through [a round of fundraising](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/impossible-foods-is-said-to-eye-7-billion-value-in-fundraising), which would give them a valuation of around 7B. This would give IPOF a stake of around 15% if they decided to go public through a SPAC. Impossible Foods is the direct competitor to Beyond Meat ([BYND](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BYND:US)), one of the current leading plant based meat producers out there.

# Discord

Discord has a valuation of  [$15 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/chat-app-discord-is-worth-15-billion-after-new-funding). Although this would only give IPOF a 5-6% stake in the company, a [PIPE](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/publications/the-role-of-private-investment-in-public-equity-pipe-in-financing-spacs-business-combinations) investment coming from Chamath, on top of the 1B$ trust, would bring us closer to the 10% ownership.

1. The greek subsidiaries opened for previous Chamath SPACs all had something to do with the company that they were merging with. For IPOB it was the Hestia Merger Sub, Hestia meaning domesticity and home. That SPAC ended up merging with a real estate company. For IPOC it was Asclepius Merger Sub, Asclepius being the god of medicine in ancient Greek mythology. That ended up merging with a healthcare company. For IPOE it was the Plutus Merger Sub, Plutus being the god of wealth. That ended up merging with a fintech company. And now he has just registered a so called Eris Merger Sub, Eris being the goddess chaos, strife and discord.
2. Microsoft talks to buy out Discord were ended in April
3. Dragoneer financing news (Bloomberg), stating that they invested $500 million in Discord, although this may just be a PIPE rumor after all..
4. The hiring of a [senior manger and a stock administrator](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-stock-administrator-at-discord-2775234648) at Discord.

# Starlink

This is the one that everyone should be talking about. Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by SpaceX, providing satellite Internet access to most of the Earth.

SpaceX is a private company and Elon has been very clear about not wanting to take SpaceX public anytime soon. On the other hand, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said last year that Starlink could be spun off from SpaceX for an initial public offering.

Elon has been very open about his dislike of traditional IPO's because of hedgefunds getting their hands on the shares first, and handing the bag to the retail investors later. He also said that he wants to reward and [give Tesla shareholders a chance to get their hands on Starlink first](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407877220543180800).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tcaas3oqfmx71.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3d4809112a0c936858bef714ce9b516b41b9166

On top of it, Chamath and Elon are very good friends, so it would be very likely that Elon would have someone close to him bring Starlink public.

Chamath was present at Elon's 50th birthday in Italy [https://youtu.be/-Cyu00cyw60](https://youtu.be/-Cyu00cyw60) At 4:45, Chamath makes a reference to a friend he saw in Italy who is celebrating his 50th birthday. He refers to him as being one of the richest people in the world and loves rockets. He doesnt mention his name but I the person he is referring to is Elon Musk. Note Elon Musk just turned 50 this June.

Chamath exited his entire position in [TSLA](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1443707466072551430?lang=en) and [SPCE](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1339425375063953409?s=21), to avoid a possible conflict of interest, something that hints towards the event of IPOF merging with Starlink. He has done this in the past, where he dropped hints on his podcast, for example the hints about Richard Branson's space flight before it was public.

Also on his podcast, Chamath revealed that's he's traveling to Africa this December to work on something that ""he's very excited about"", which he said he couldn't reveal just yet. Coincidentally, it just so happens that [Starlink plans to launch in Africa late in 2021](https://africanews.space/starlink-satellite-internet-target-africa-coverage-late-2021-2022/).

[SpaceX also bought Swarm](https://www.space.com/spacex-to-acquire-swarm-technologies-starlink-satellites). Swarm Technologies, Inc. is a private company building a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for communications with Internet Of Things devices using a Store and forward design. Social Capital (Chamath) incubated Swarm.On July 16, 2021, Swarm entered into an agreement to become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX.

With this being said, the effect of IPOF being attached to Elon's name could lead to this stock being one of the biggest dormant monsters on the stock market at the moment.

* **4. Strategies on how to play this**

Something that makes this play so interesting is the fact that the price is still so close to the NAV, while it's 52 week high is 17$.

The fact that it's been hovering around the 10$ range for so long, totally killed the IV of the options. You can buy ITM 10c expiring this month for 0.25$ which translates to as little as $0.01-0.02 in premium. LEAPS also have very very small premiums, so people that want to take a less risky approach to trading this, Jan/Mar/Apr calls are probably the ones suitable for you.

Everyone should trade according to their own risk tolerance.

If you don't feel like risking too much with options, you can go for the safer approach and buy IPOF shares or IPOF warrants. A warrant is a contract that gives the holder the right to purchase from the issuer a certain number of additional shares of common stock in the future at a certain price, often a premium to the stock price at the time the warrant is issued ($11.5 in our case).

The YOLO approach to this play is obviously the OTM calls, but these should be treated carefully, as you're paying pure premium, and their value can eventually go to 0$ the closer they get to expiration. (we all love to see those 50:1 returns tho)

Source: https://www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/10/12/3-covid-stocks-that-can-turn-1000-into-10000/

Doximity was created to allow doctors and other healthcare professionals to network over the internet. The company is like Facebook or Microsoft's LinkedIn for doctors. Eighty percent of American physicians are on the platform, as are 90% of medical school students. The company has seen amazing growth, even before the pandemic emerged. And the network effect will keep its monopoly intact.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company had two main business lines. Drug companies and other healthcare players would pay to reach the company's vast physician network. And the company would help doctors and other healthcare workers navigate employment opportunities. The company achieved profitability fairly quickly, and it enjoys a 30% profit margin today.

When COVID-19 upset the world, Doximity responded by quickly rolling out its third business line -- its new telehealth service, Dialer. This free service allowed physicians to use the internet to communicate with their patients. And Doximity charged physicians additional fees when they wanted to expand the service. 

Dialer was extremely popular with the doctors on the network. The company reported 63 million telehealth visits in 2020, a number that dwarfs all the other telehealth players. (Teladoc had 11 million visits.) So revenue has zoomed during the pandemic, running up 100% in the most recent quarter. (Cont)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmqjxa/docs_squeeze/

\- DropBox is profitable, and growing

\- HelloSign (owned by dropbox) operates in the high margin electronic signature space and is starting to really contribute to revenue

\- P/E is around 30 and dropping as revenue has been increasing year over year for 5+ years with share price relatively stagnant (except for run-up this year after bottoming out). 

\- Integration of service with Atlassian, Zoom and many other service providers has the potential to drive growth from outside their own free user base

Personally I believe that DropBox is an uncut gem that have gone largely overlooked by ecosystem investors due to their heavy reliance on free users. This is changing and people may not in large have noticed their more enterprise friendly newer offerings. 

DropBox report their earnings after market today, and I think they could be gearing up for a rally.

1,"11/05/2021, 01:54:45",TTD Pre-Earnings Thesis,BDRBDRBDR,"Anyone who follows The Trade Desk (TTD) closely enough should be aware of the company's role in the digital advertising ecosystem: auctioning ad space and placing ads. What's strange is how the stock has acted during the past few weeks. It's almost as if large swaths of investors don't understand how their business works and how TTD's exposure to varying facets of the digital advertising market is different from that of other players. 

So what I have seen is significant drops in the price of TTD shares following earnings reports from the likes of SNAP and FB, which I understand are largely driven by concerns about changes to the Apple iOS ecosystem that make it really difficult to target advertising on mobile. The changes are absolutely a concern; media reports conservatively place the revenue losses at nearly $10bn this quarter. However, these barely affect TTD, which disclosed earlier in 2021 that they expect no material impact from the iOS changes (they have spent much of the past couple of years developing workarounds).

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-magnite-the-trade-desk-and-other-ad-tech-stocks-tanked-friday-2021-10-23](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-magnite-the-trade-desk-and-other-ad-tech-stocks-tanked-friday-2021-10-23)

Of course, Google's earnings report and guidance demonstrated that secular weakness in digital advertising isn't as great a threat as folks might have thought. And (frankly) TTD's business is more like Google's than it is like FB or SNAP's. Which brings me to today's developments. It's difficult to see why TTD is down by 5.5% today until you realize that ROKU reported earnings yesterday evening and tanked. ROKU is, of course, a HUGE player in the ads space- it's the real reason why it makes and sells TVs and dongles and such. But their placement of ads and thus their ad revenue is HEAVILY dependent upon two things: hardware sales and adding users. ROKU apparently added new users this quarter, but its hardware sales tanked because supply chain. ROKU is also seeing some of its hardware partners drop out and it is seeing increased competition from Amazon in this space as well. TTD faces none of these headwinds

I am fairly confident TTD will beat and raise and that those who have spent the past couple of weeks selling TTD on bad news from other advertisers are correlating things badly. They report 11/8; I dropped $20k in call options for 11/12 at the $75 strike. I may add to this today or tomorrow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmqdxg/ttd_preearnings_thesis/

&amp;#x200B;

First off, let me start by saying that most of this seems to be an indictment of the previous management regimes there and CEO's and some of this is likely mitigated with the recent executive sweeping they've been doing and getting actual industry professionals into the org with authority. Nevertheless, the repeated failures of cornerstone products to make it in the market and customer announcements that no longer appear on their customer lists begs the question, wtf is going on over there? And more importantly, is it specifically a problem with the technology, the manufacturing, or total mismanagement of the org, maybe all the above?! One thing they have NOT announced in the last several years was ANY real technology advancement or new developments (their decks talk about incremental increases in energy and power density which is code for they're swapping in new cells from their cell suppliers but that's not their tech advancement it's the cell suppliers). That is what spurred this DD because I see lots of people pumping the stock and hanging on every announcement like it's going to MOON any second now, but after this dive, it looks more like a long, prolonged, trudge through reorganizing the company, redeveloping processes and manufacturing lines/methods, and actually developing new tech through validation to hit the market - having done this before, this is a 2-4 year process soooo yeah...

For context, I follow the EV and battery industries and know quite a bit about batteries and battery manufacturing at a technical level so I'm always reading in between the lines with announcements related to this technology.

Sound good in theory, but no tangible proof of these being legitimate binding orders (remember Lordstown's giant order book?) or that translating into revenue. Time will tell if this is real I suppose but this article is almost a year old and no significant revenue has been achieved (save the calls for the ""global supply chain shortage"" shield, I'll get to that later...)

Partnership with Komatsu and Thunder forklift battery packs...Komatsu not on any current customer lists or decks and Thunder pack appears to have been mothballed as it's not on the website and they moved totally to heavy-industrial class 4 and up. So what happened here? Komatsu is a major player with zillions of vehicles in the field and sold annually so there was retrofit and new vehicle opportunity here. The announcement is from years ago, should have showed up as revenue in their pre-IPO financials but as we know, they barely had any meaningful revenue for most of their existance.

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170718005129/en/Romeo-Power-Introduces-First-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Pack-Adaptable-for-Any-Electric-Forklift-Make-or-Model](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170718005129/en/Romeo-Power-Introduces-First-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Pack-Adaptable-for-Any-Electric-Forklift-Make-or-Model)

THUNDER PACKs design, materials and thermals, combined with Power Designers advanced charging algorithm **are totally winning the day with our customers  especially big, name-brand packaged goods and food companies with massive fleets of forklifts in their warehouses.**

Where were all these customers that were totally winning with their massive fleets? Where's the revenue from all those sales of this industry leading battery pack? I didn't see it on the pre-IPO financials...did you?

Another failed product, but this time in the customer handheld battery arena. But the really interesting thing is this comment in the article:

**""Itsays it has design contracts with five of the six biggest automakers, but Patterson declined to say which ones. The company has raised $40 million in funding to-date.""**

Oh really?! That's a very very big deal, to have contracts with 5 of the 6 majors OEMs...where are they on the pre-IPO customer lists/investor deck? Where are they now? Where was the revenue from these deals back then?

[https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-romeo-battery-20170125-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-romeo-battery-20170125-story.html)

Romeo is starting out with niche customers. **The company said its got orders with a builder of small commuter cars in Brazil, a bus company thats adding battery-powered buses to its hydrogen fuel lineup and even a forklift battery company**, where lead acid batteries will be replaced with lithium ion versions.

Let's assume the hydrogen guy is Nikola who actually IS on a customer list for them, but the Brazilian bus company orders?? ...Those are massive batteries...should have fetched some sizable revenue which is no where to be found. We've already discussed the forklift batteries above as well so I assume that was Komatsu but that seems to have resulted in nothing.

[https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/with-bold-claims-about-its-battery-power-romeo-power-closes-on-30-million-in-seed-funding/](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/with-bold-claims-about-its-battery-power-romeo-power-closes-on-30-million-in-seed-funding/)

Is that special packaging process enough to sway big customers? Unsurprisingly, **the company says it is. According to Patterson, Romeo has booked $65 million in manufacturing contracts with its 15 customers, including five automotive companies  two of which are among the big three in Detroit, he says, referring to Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.**

Ah more mention of lots of customers including major OEMs again. That $65M of booked contracts...yeah, sure, must not have been dollars I guess because not even a fraction of that shows up on any financial documents that company released pre-IPO or post.

Lastly, this one is a bit of an oddball but I had a SERIOUS gripe with them when they wrote down most of their forecast revenue right after the IPO and cited cell supply constraints globally because they have a guy whose job appears to SPECIFICALLY BE PREVENTING THIS KIND OF SHIT. He's been working there for years and I'm not saying he's bad at his job, but it looks like this is what he does and why he exists, so they should have been prepared for supply chain issues and locking down cell supply commitments years in advance with all that contracted revenue they kept yapping about...Cells are THEE most important thing to a battery pack manufacturer, without them you do not have a business. SUMMARY: THIS DOES NOT ADD UP!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so all that said, let me pacify all the people that are going to cry about them being a startup and this is mostly in the past, startups pivot, or it's part of the game, or they got rid of the crappy execs, or they saw bigger opportunity in class 4-8 so they strategically chose to dump those products and customers...Sure that's all has some potentially legitimacy but are you trying to tell me they walked away from $65M dollars contracted from top tier auto OEMs while they were an early stage startup starving for revenue and looking for long term contract commitments?! Those would have been very big, very steady sales and immediately legitimized their tech, manufacturing, business operations, etc.. (i.e. MADE THEM A REAL COMPANY AND NOT A STARTUP). Also are we to assume they dumped a strategic partnership with Komatsu, who's one of the top forklift manufacturers in the globally with tens of thousands of vehicles sold annually (again, huge opportunity for lead-acid retrofit replacement and new vehicles)? Come on now guy....Again, all I'm saying is that these things don't add up, so back to the original question: **is it specifically a problem with the technology, the manufacturing, or total mismanagement of the org, maybe all the above?!**

None of these announcements seem to have panned out into real actual, auditable revenue or accounts receivable on their financials....SOOOO how much faith should we all be putting into the touted $234M in Lion Electric contracted orders that they advertised? Why do people think this is going to MOON/ROCKET/BLABLA with any surface level announcement that's made? The fact that the share price is over $4 is a gift imho given the long history of all sizzle and no steak. Right now their A/R from the last quarterly sits at $2M of sales and the previous quarter was $1.4M, so they sold $600k worth of batteries over that time. The next financial report out is supposed to be Nov 8th and I'm going to be watching and listening like a hawk for what they are REALLY saying and I suggest any other investors do too because the analysts on the calls ask a lot of meaningless softball questions so I'm waiting for when someone knowledgeable about actual battery design and manufacturing asks pretty basic and simple questions that hold the management to task.

For the ""diamond hands"" and the kool-aid chuggers, keep getting excited over meaningless PR like HQ move, or sensor collaboration, blabla...none of that directly impacts their actual manufacturing and sales except as an impediment or distraction from the core business.

1,"11/05/2021, 01:32:58","FASHIONETTE - Finally, a startup IPO that hasn't been previously inflated by private equity and offers private investors a ""tenbagger flight"" in a rocket",fredllllllll,"Fashionette is like a non-listed startup. Extremely much private equity in the background, which at the moment does not allow big players to step in the door. Genui GmbH holds 39%. That's stock market like two decades ago when you could grab an early piece of the pie from Amazon &amp; Co. Today, private equity investors usually blow up a startup, take it public and then cash out their shares at the expense of the small shareholders. Here you can secure a share 50% below a fair IPO price! 

In principle, Fashionette was already a buy at the time of the IPO. Then the price was massively punished. There was a sales revision because there was a change in logistics (this change was also referred to in the IPO prospectus). For this reason, the delivery promise could not be kept in the short term and there was a sales revision. It is assumed that sales over the year will be approximately EUR 10 million lower (now approximately EUR 140 million in sales for 2021). At the end of September, we received feedback that all problems had been solved again. In the future, the logistics change is excellent. The new partner is now the globally known ITG with 15 warehouses in Europe. Fashionette uses the main warehouse in Oberhausen there. This brings with the excellent connection incredible advantages. The cut-off times are significantly lower. This means that a package can be handed over to the carrier even later and the delivery time is reduced. Why did they change? With further acquisitions, they expect revenues in the range of one billion by 2025 (I think that's unrealistic, but even half that would be an absolute hammer). Fashionette is reaching a size where a professional partner is necessary for the future. The old partner would not have been able to support the future volume. A changeover simply delivers a quarter of problems. The outdoor label RevolutionRace was able to increase their sales by over 100%, also thanks to the help of this logistics partner.

Profits are not interesting at the moment. Why? Growth is the priority. Marketing expenses have doubled. Nevertheless, Fashionette is break-even. Without logistics changes, there would be a profit on the books. Why am I extremely bullish now? First, Fashionette acquired Brandfield at the end of the 2021 half year. Brandfield is active in a similar segment with focus on BeNeLux. Brandfield will deliver EUR 20 million in sales for the Fashionette balance sheet in 2021. The remaining EUR 20 million in sales (Brandfield generates EUR 40 million in sales per year) may only be included in the balance sheet next year. Without Brandfield, Fashionette grows independently by 25% this year (without logistics change it would be 30%). This means that Fashionette will have sales of approximately EUR 200 million in 2022. The calculation is 140 as in 2021 + the additional 20 from Brandfield and 25-30% growth thereafter. The purchase of Brandfield was financed from the IPO proceeds.

The most important reason why I am convinced that Fashionette has an incredible future is the product portfolio. Comparisons with ASOS or Zalando show that a net return of 2.5 - 4% is realistic. BUT Fashionette operates mainly in the luxury segment WITHOUT clothing. Clothing has the huge disadvantage that it often does not fit due to size or cut. With bags or accessories, this disadvantage does not apply. This is also reflected in the lower return rate. That's why I think a net return of up to 7.5% is realistic. Furthermore, Fashionette is constantly expanding its assortment. Most recently, items from the beauty segment with perfumes were added to the platform.

Fashionette now has a market capitalization of less than EUR 100 million with at the same time EUR 140 million sales in 2021. There will probably be a price sales ratio of 0.5 for 2022!!! Fashionette has no debt. Future profits can be constantly reinvested. The market for luxury items is booming enormously. Large parts of the company are held by major shareholders. This is a part for small investors!!! PS: The CEO bought at a price of around 24 after the share price plummeted by 60k after the publication of the sales revision. Today the price is below 16.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmpwwd/fashionette_finally_a_startup_ipo_that_hasnt_been/

1,"11/05/2021, 01:21:49","$BGFV - A fundamentally undervalued, technically bullish GME-like dark horse primed for a huge ramp up by 11/17",GMEsquoze," 

If your time is short, below are my  talking points on why I believe $BGFV is about to explode upwards,  explained later in this DD.

1. Strong Balance Sheet
2. Stock Buybacks
3. Special Dividends
4. Positive EPS
5. Low PE ratio
6. Undervalued at face value
7. All fundamental metrics favorable
8. Operational strategic advantage regarding supply chain and political conditions
9. Potential acquisition target if market cap continues to be low
10. Massive short interest presenting GME like technicals
11. **Strong balance sheet:**  Their recent quarterly earning reports that their balance sheet had  $114m in cash / cash equivalents on hand with zero debt. This presents a  $36m improvement on cash since the start of the year despite their  stellar record of stock buybacks and issuance of dividends.
12. **Stock buybacks:** BGFV has repurchased 100,498 shares over the course of the 3rd quarter.
13. **Special dividend on top of regular dividend:**  Announcement of a $1.00 special dividend payable on 12/01/2021, to  shareholders of record as of 11/17/2021; $0.25 regular dividend payable  on 12/15/2021 to shareholders of record as of 12/01/2021
14. **Positive EPS:**  Diluted EPS for the 39 weeks ending in 10/03 is $3.81/share. 4th  quarter guidance for the final quarter of 2021 is $0.55 - $0.70, so the  forward EPS for the 2021 year is approx $4.36 - $4.51 EPS.
15. **Low forward PE ratio:**  With a stock price of $31 / share and a forward EPS guidance of $4.44 /  share, forward PE ratio is approx 6.9. Compare this to the the industry  average at 21.15, and SP500 at 29.36, this presents nearly a 310%  discount compared to peers. (to put in perspective, for BGFV to be  trading fairly among peers would price it at $93 / share. Another  perspective, Walmart's PE ratio is 23.72)
16. **Undervalued at face value**:  For a company with over 430 stores spread across over 11 states (3  planned to open within the coming quarter), positive operating cash  flow, and free shareholder equity of 280m; with the stock trading at  31/share, it is valued at merely $620.8M.
17. **Valuation  involving profitability, dividend, growth rates, operating  effectiveness, and financial strength/ stability metrics are all  favorable:** As mentioned earlier, PE ratio is low, presenting a  310% discount compared to peers. It also pays dividends, which is  impressive since most companies in the sector don't even pay a dividend.  The dividend is also sustainable and don't impact the company's bottom  line despite being a massive 3.6% yield. BGFV's returns on asset, return  on equity, revenue per employee are 15.18%, 47.94%, and $142,187  respectively, which is among the leaders of the sector. As mentioned  earlier, BGFV uses little to no debt and have very little financial  risk. In regards with profitability, BGFV's net profit margin is 9.02%,  when the industry is -10.76%
18. **Strategically advantageous supply chain management and operating environment**:  During a time when supply chain management mattered most, BGFV's supply  chain is strategically placing stores within range of their  distribution centers, the west coast, with California being the state  with the largest sum of stores. This focus on California another  strategic advantage, especially for ammo purchases, since California  requires brick and mortar stores to complete ammo sales; [at a time when new gun ownership have rocketed to unseen heights.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)  To bring another catalyst to this, BGFV has retained it's firearm and  ammunition business when other big box retailers such as Walmart and  Dicks Sporting goods have begin to wind down their firearms segment.  Further exacerbating the catalyst is the democratic president elected  (which historically always increase ammo/firearm purchases compared to  republican presidents in power).
19. **Potential target for acquisition with the appointment of Lily Chang to the board**:  Lily Chang is the Chief portfolio officer of LGP which is  coincidentally the same company that took BGFV public back in 2002. This  is entirely speculation, but with the market cap as low as 600m, this  is potentially foreboding a takeover in the near future.
20. **And  finally, despite everything said and done, the stock is the 3rd most  shorted stock on US exchanges, and like GME, presents a huge opportunity  for a short-squeze like event:** Short squeezes are events where  certain catalysts need to be present. The stock must have high  percentage of public shares shorted; the cost to borrow must be high;  the shares available to short must be low; a dividend, share buyback, or  other catalyst must be present; and it must have high trading volume. A  couple weeks ago, not all of these were present. The stock is over 43%  of float shorted as of the date of this post (8,480,000 shares), the  shares avail to short is 150k (which is moderately low), cost to borrow  was around 2% (which is very low), and no dividend was announced.. until  now. The upcoming 11/17 ex-dividend is the catalyst we've been looking  for. The last time the stock did a dividend, it drained shares avail to  borrow, spiked cost to borrow, and spiked the stock price from $23 to  $32 over a couple days. [That time, the % of shares sold short was less than 38%](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bgfv/comments/pq9gsi/1y_chart_cross_referencing_stock_price_shares/).  It has never been as high as it has been now, and I am predicting that  the price movement on or before 11/17 when the dividend is 2.8% yield  will violently margin call anyone who is short BGFV. If this occurs when  the stock price is trading at $35 (now), it presents a 41% upside. This  only gets worst for people with bear positions as the stock trades  higher.

To that end I started with the NASDAQ earnings calendar:  [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings)   By default it lists by market cap which is good because I only want bigger companies that might have more volatility.  I went down each list looking at the top 30 or so companies and then checked each chart.  I only wanted to buy calls that were at least ITM sometime in the last year and I also didn't want to spend more then $25 a pop.  I figured I'd buy 4 or 5 per week, each week, and see what happens.  If a single one hits big in a month, like BBBY, it would cover all the costs for the rest.  Each call was bought at the expiration closest to after earnings.  Each strike was bought simply based on the cost being under $25 so some are really OTM.  If getting the price resulted in a super OTM call I just skipped it and looked at another.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my first batch that I bought yesterday.  I plan on selling each the day after earnings if it's green and will put a stop loss on it if it's red:

&amp;#x200B;

11/05 UBER 54c - $20 (down $1)

11/12 DIS 200c - $12 (up $1)

11/12 RBLX 110c - $14 (up $1)

11/12 SOFI 31c - $13 (down $2)

11/12 SPCE 26c - $15 (down $2)

11/12 TME 9.5c - $10 (down $3)

11/19 CPNG 37.5c - $15 (even)

11/19 ROOT 7.5c - $15 (even)

&amp;#x200B;

Will look at earnings for the week of 11/15 and buy more calls next week.  Please feel free to call me a idiot.  I'll update this post when I lose all the money I spent.

1,"11/05/2021, 00:48:11",Tesla is valued fairly,Wowowiwa69,"I think people misunderstand TSLAs valuation. Every post thats complaining and moaning about how crazy Teslas valuation is simply misses the most important points: 

1) its a subscription company. Tesla offers paid services in their cars. The premium connectivity package that cost $10 per month. With current production rate if 1 million EVs and 1.5 million next year, Teslas revenue will increase significantly not just through selling cars but also through the premium connectivity subscriptions. Moreover, the FSD capability is also going to be under the subscription model which will cost $199/month, according to electrek. 

(https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/?_gl=1*185lamx*_ga*YW1wLWZkZ01jdFNRT25KRXk4NjlYVjRLMEJUV2RPWDRkYjU4TG9tRDAyUDFZWWJ2RFVLT3NKRGlDeE1adklPZzlfc04.)

In technical terms, with estimated 40 million Teslas on the road by the end of this decade, that will add up to a shit ton of money that comes from software subscriptions. 

A good case scenario is this: (40,000,000) cars x ($210 monthly fee) x 12 months = shit ton of money/annual revenue. (Or $100.8 Billion annually.) 

2) its a utility company. Imagine being GM and owning most gas stations around the US. Tesla has the biggest and best charging network in the world that is only getting bigger and better. It is also opening up to other EVs which will have a subscription option or a higher one time payment option. And that already works today. 

(https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-hyundai-ioniq-mach-e-test-video/) 

Also, not to mention the actual utility business of solar and power wall, which papa Musk mentioned that it will be as big of a business as their car business. And we do see evidence of that too. 

( https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-solar-and-energy-storage-business-rakes-in-810m-finally-exceeds-cost-of-revenue/) 

That being said, supply shortage is the biggest problem, but its just a matter of time before it is solved. 

3) Its a Dojo company. The Dojo project is a mind blowing supercomputer which will be at the core of Teslas growth. The supercomputer that makes every Tesla the superior car. If there is a future with on demand robotaxis, it is one that as of now only Tesla is able to create. Monetary value will come in a form of subscriptions, licensing to other car makers, or direct to consumers. Either way, that by itself is worth a SHIT TON of money. 

4) its an Elon Musk company. Daddy Musk doesnt fail - dont bet against him. 

Conclusion: Tesla will be worth much more in the future and it doesnt take a genius to see that. You could probably double or triple your money with Tesla within 5 years even if you bought the stock today.
 
TLDR: Tesla is aight. s should stop moaning, and start thinking logically.

1,"11/05/2021, 00:32:12",Why $BNTX and $MRNA are down today,Nofapdeity,"You may have seen my [dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlbvwn/bntx_could_be_an_amazing_play_in_the_next_23_weeks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) on $BNTX yesterday and I called it a good buy. You can go to that post if you want more info on the stock. Others wrote DDs on the company yesterday as well. 

In my bearish section, I wrote that if MRNA had a bad earnings, BNTX would fall like a waterfall. Sadly that happened and MRNA had an extremely horrible earnings report that brought the stock down almost $60. Sucks for those holding mrna. BNTX even though it actually benefits from a bad MRNA earnings, followed suit and dropped a good $30 today. Like I said, BNTX follows mrna like a puppy. 

However, I am still bullish. PFE had an excellent earnings, and that gives us a good idea of what $BNTX will look like next week since they have a partnership. MRNA earnings should not affect us for long, and I have a good feeling $BNTX earnings report will bounce it up. The numbers dont lie. We now know BNTX and PFE are the vaccine kings. MRNA failed in getting their children vaccine approved in time. The government is buying vaccines like its Halloween candy. Your kids are getting the PFE vaccine. Governments are balls deep in PFE stock (it is one of the top stocks congress likes) and now BNTX is very closely associated with them. 

The gap between mrna and BNTX is closer than ever right now, this morning it was only $9 apart. There is a possibility that BNTX overtakes mrna in price very soon and becomes the higher priced stock, which is huge. This could stop MRNA from affecting BNTX on every drop. 

TLDR: We can basically thank MRNA for bringing us back to the high 260s low 270s because of the crap earnings.

1,"11/05/2021, 00:31:09",Amazon,Quintilien,"Hello, Im kinda new to the stock market. I only have positions un ETF but Im looking for few solid stocks to enter.
So I tried to calculate the intrinsec value of few stocks.
I used this formula:
EPS*(1+ estimated growth for the next 5 years)^5 * PER over 5 years

For the estimated growth I lower the number by -25%

For AMZN it gives me : 

Growth 36% -25% = 27%
ESP 51,1
PER 135,79

Wich gives me

51,1*3,3*135,79= 22 898$

If I want to have a growth of 16% over the years :

22898/(1.16)^5 = 10 900$

And I divide it by 2 to have a margin of safety :

5 450$

Yet the AMZN price is at 3 455$

Which means it would be a good price and a good invest.

Am I totaly wrong ? My calculus is ludicrous ?

Earnings will be on November 15th 2021!! (Released November 3, 2021)

In my other post I stated I will narrow down my DD to one. Good Luck!

My other plays are in the following: $Dole (stock/calls), $NVDA (stock), $ERX calls, $GME and now $POWW (Stock @ 6.26 and Calls exp 12/16/2022).

$POWW  Ammo, Inc.

**Reason:** Covid vaccine could turn people into zombies. 34.7% of the globe or 2.71B people are vaccinated and could be zombies. Zombies bad, $POWW good.

**Case:** Short-term Bullish on upcoming earnings, not a short squeeze but a huge earnings catalyst. Recent DOD contracts, current 200% sales backlog (not including DOD contract), last earnings release announcement net revenue increased over 360%. POSITIVE FCF/EBITDA/NI. Long-term planning - new facility will be up and running in summer of 2022 will increase revenue substantially and capacity constraints removed.

**Summary:** $POWW is vertically integrated with ammo manufacturing, distribution through big box and mom/pop retail outlets, ecommerce and the recently acquired Gunbroker.com platform. Oh and recently approved military contracts. **Manufacturing, Distribution, Technology Platform, DOD Contracts, Multiple Marketing Channels.** Management is structuring the organization for the long haul and will be a driving force in the industry.

**Catalysts**:

1.) Zombies.

2.) **Acquired Gunbroker.com** (May  2021)  You know, the eBay for guns, ammo, and other cool things to take out zombies. This acquisition assumed the debt of $50m (essentially the only debt on Ammo, Inc books) and kicks out approximately $40m in EBITDA a year. Transaction valuation was placed at $240m, or 6.0x EV/EBITDA, seriously, 6.0x EBITDA for the eBay of guns. Talk about an absolute freaking robbery value to acquire Gunbroker.com. Super value add play that has not yet been integrated to its fullest.

The question is what can you do with the extra $40m in EBITDA per year from an asset light, low working capital acquisition?

Sell your manufactured ammo to millions of consumers directly with limited marketing expense. $POWW. Oh and take that $40m to pay for growth CapEx. Wait What? Building a new, larger manufacturing facility to meet the demand of ammo for a potential zombie shit storm.

Buzz words that create further value creations: **Proprietary Technology Platform, Brand Value, Leading Industry Credibility, Unmatched Scale, STRONG Barriers to ENTRY.**

3.) **New Manufacturing Facility**  Too many people are preparing for zombies and those people are also scared of democrats in office. Currently under construction, a new 165,000 sqft facility, this makes sense because the **current backlog sits at 200%!!**

4.) **Industry Tailwinds Thanks Democrats!**  Firearm background checks are up, which is a leading indicator to buying more ammo, grew 61% YOY in 2020, 78% YOY 1-2021. More guns purchased more ammo needed. **Guns go $poww, ammo go bye bye, zombies go splat, consumers buy more product.**

5.) **Earnings Report in November ** I mentioned the 200% backlog, right? What about management raising the 2Q-22 Fiscal revenue estimate from $51m to $55m? Who cares its only a $4m increase, or management is potentially trying to communicate to its investors, Hey fool, do I have your attention? We killed it 1Q-22, net revenue was up 360% compared to last year, ammunition sales are up 342% as well. Our backlog was $238m at the end of 1Q-22 and we probably have a larger increase than $4m but we are trying to get your damn attention, Nice!!

**6.)** **Awarded U.S. DOD Contract 09/23/21 ** Holy shit the Department of Defense is zombie prepping too! I forgot to mention the patented products $POWW offers. Opps, oh well. Awarded a contract by the Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate (IWTSD), formerly CTTSO, formed and operating under the U.S. Department of Defense, to design and manufacture signature-on-target rounds (SoT) in support of U.S. military operations. **Frickin Laser Beam Bullets.**

Summarizing for those that cant read charts.

Insiders increased position by 1.4m shares or $8.4m in the past 12 months.

Institutions increased their positions by 14m shares or $84m, now own approximately 30%! Niceeee!! Thats huge. **Basically, institutions doubled their position! Insiders/Institutions own close to 60% and are doubling down.**

**SHORT INTEREST:**

 Dark Pool Short Volume Ratio 51.80% - source: FINRA 

**Options Chain:**

OPTIONS ARE DIRT CHEAP!!!! You check it out. I got tired of writing this. Looks like zombies should be nervous. Huge ITM option impact on 10/15, but who cares. Followed by huge ITM option impact on 11/19, I bet the earnings report will be around this one. Pop goes the weasel.

**Price Target Estimate:**

$12.00 without flexing too hard.

$14.20 with the flex.

**TLDR:**

I got tired or writing this, as I have other stuff to do. But there is lots more to this, so do your own diligence. Lots of catalysts for earnings to pop in 30 days. None of this is financial advice and you do you, I will do me. But for me, I am terrified of zombies potentially taking over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmobk0/poww_due_diligence_earnings_nov_15th/

\- 5x revenue is cheap for a tech company growing revenue by 30% year, but only if its losing money. EBIX has had a healthy profit margin for years, ewww, it should stay at 1x revenue. Stick with DASH (24x revenue), they bleed plenty of cash and people will definitely order food from their basement forever.

\- Their fast-growing EBIX cash business is becoming a household name in India and is going to spin off and IPO on the Bombay stock exchange. Which doesnt really matter because theres not that many Indians left and they eek by on casino money.

Upside is to $150-200/sh.  Model Lumber prices at $450-600 mbf.  I get EPS of $15-20.  
What do you want to pay for that 1x P/E?

There are only 10 million shares out, so very small supply, company has no intention of raising equity.  Lumber futures are steady - better is to look at cash rates from Random Lengths.   We are talking flat to up since end of July.  LONG and strong.  You might as well because if EPS is $15-20, the stock price should be much higher.

I know how much we all love losing money in this sub so I was thinking about running this strategy by the more educated options traders here. This strategy is based off of the covered call ETF NUSI, but inverted.

NUSI strat:

\- Buy 100 shares

\- Sell covered call ATM

\- Use part of premium to buy slightly OTM put to manage risk

The NUSI ETF returns about 8% dividends with minimal downside. My thought is to do the same thing, but inverted for the coming   market (because eventually JPOW is gonna fuck off with that printer, we all know it).

My strat:

\- Sell 100 shares short

\- Sell put option ATM

\- Buy slightly OTM calls to cover downside (if the price goes up)

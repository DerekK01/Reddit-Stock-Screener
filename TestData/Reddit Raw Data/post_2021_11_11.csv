&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the smartest tool in the shed, but frankly i'm done living my life as a wageslave.

So I'm willing to risk everything i've got on the YOLO of a lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you guys give me some pointers how and where (safe platforms with working cash out functions, and where i can get the highest leverage) to bet.

I'm thinking 'bout buying leveraged longs on BTX, and trying to ride a (hopefully) 10% wave.

Do you think this is feaseable?

Also I dont have any knowledge of this stuff, would it be possible to get leveraged \*100 for a long with a timespan of 1 year +? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance,",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrochd/degenerate_looking_for_the_yolo_of_a_lifetime/

1,"11/11/2021, 23:54:12",CLNE Catalysts playing out just as expected. BP deal and Cummins earnings confirm we are on track. Stay tuned for positive momentum to continue.,Disasterdujour888,"Post earnings there has been a bit of profit taking. The selldown yesterday also spooked the weak hands. Noobs panicked. 

But as has been highlighted by many the positive newsflow cycle is only just beginning. The list of catalysts below was shared earlier this week. In just those few days two catalysts have already played out.

Read Cummins transcript. RNG trucks are the future. Cummins is betting big on diesel replacement. 

And today BP and CLNE announced agreement to expand relationship. Iowa dairy farm project announced adding 7mm gallons of RNG. Expect more such deals. 

Be on the right side of history with CLNE. Embrace RNG. GLTAL. Not investing advice. Always do your own DD. 

Catalysts:

1) COP26 action: world leaders have just spent the last week pontificating how bad methane is, how we need to do more to capture it, how dairies landfills and wastewater is all contributing more than we realize blah blah blah. Well after all the big talk government will have to actually act and do something. So expect some announcements in the upcoming weeks as countries move towards action. In the US the infra bill is now passed and Biden has already pledged implicitly that alternative fuels are part of the official US energy plan. We just need to see explicit details on how RNG will benefit directly. More news to come. Its just a matter of time. 

2) CLNE mentioned that various states are already preparing their own legislative initiatives to move in the direction of CA. Basically create support initiatives to incentivize clean fuel adoption at the state level which would include RNG. Lets see what happens but I welcome discussion of RNG in state politics. New York is expected to lead the way; other states usually follow. CLNE appears to be involved in some of these state efforts FYI which makes sense as they are a key stakeholder. 

3) AMZN was referred to as anchor customer on CLNEs call last week. They are basically the customer that broke the chicken vs egg conundrum that CLNE needed to solve. You cant invest in RNG upstream production unless you know you can offload it; but nobody wants to commit to RNG trucking fleets if they do not know how to get the RNG fuel when and where they need it. Bottom line AMZN is confirmed fully committed to RNG if that was not already clear from their recently published sustainability report. And D Day for rollout and full deployment of 2700 RNG is early 2022. These are heavy duty trucks with Cummins engines. Once the full AMZN fleet is deployed 2700 RNG trucks will be criss crossing the US and that alone equates to about 40mm gallons of RNG demand or 40 percent of the current gallons of RNG CNG LNG passing through CLNEs infrastructure per quarter. Confirmation that AMZN is fully deployed should be an important milestone (and of course it will
be reflected in Q1 earnings). 

4) CLNE this Q talked about the AMZN effect - basically when other big operators see what AMZN is doing (deploying 2700 RNG trucks) they get FOMO and jump in because they do not want to be seen as unsustainable or behind the curve. CLNE would not have said this unless they have had inquiries. They cant name names but Another big customer win would be huge. 

5) New cummins engine is a game changer and we will Hear more about it as cummins doubles down on its anti-diesel initiatives. The availability of this truck should make switch to RNG engines more compelling for trucking fleets because it delivers extra power that older engines lacked. This is important. If trucking fleets do not trust the RNG equipment to meet performance specs they obviously wont spend the capex. But power difference is no longer an excuse vs diesel engines. From a sustainability angle they are Certified 90pct cleaner than diesel! So expectation is we are going to see RNG engine commitments roll in and We need to keep a close eye on Cummins updates on RNG engine sales which will be leading indicator of fuel demand. Good news is that so far interest in the new engines has exceeded cummins own expectations and Cummins has never been more bullish on adoption of RNG. Any more news from Cummins will be a catalyst for CLNE. 

6) Without committed demand for RNG you can not commit to capex heavy RNG production. This is the chicken vs egg conundrum. But the demand is there (again AMZN = anchor) so CLNE and its upstream partners are going full throttle on building its proprietary RNG supply base. CLNE already has 4 projects in midwest via BP. Next week it will be initiating one big project in Taxes with Total. And then soon to be announced is a deal with one of americas largest dairy farms in Idaho (2nd largest) to begin producing millions of gallons of negative carbon RNG per year. Thats the quote. CLNE cant say more but you can tell this one is big. It also sounds like this project can scale up even further over time because the dairy farms is going to add tens of thousands of additional cow heads over time. Its already the 2nd biggest dairy farm but it will grow dramatically which means more RNG. CLNE is going to have to make some public announcements about this project in the upcoming weeks. Its material and signals major shift in the dairy industry. Any announcement and fanfare around this project would be a great catalyst supporting the upstream side of the RNG story. 

7) CLNE has never been great about giving investors specific numbers. Investors need clarity and guidance but CLNE has found it difficult to articulate their growth in numbers because there have been too many moving pieces. That has been a problem and one of the shortcomings of Littlefair and his management team to date. But that is about to change.  CLNE hinted that they will be providing some updated numbers soon. What we know today is that CLNE and its partners BP and Total have approx 10-25mm gallons of RNG Production in their proprietary pipeline coming in at various stages in the next 18-24 months+. This number is as of TODAY. various projects are being identified and negotiated as we speak including the big dairy project mentioned above so This number is going up. Any new projects will only increase this number and with some Big projects in the works the jump could be meaningful. Stay tuned for the big announcement.

More importantly, they specifically have amassed a huge inventory of what were previously 10-20k cars to appeal to the lower/middle income demographic. This range has appreciated more than any range of used vehicle. Were talking 50-60% from a couple years ago in many cases.

Anecdotally, I have friends and family who have purchased from Shift and they unanimously have said its infinitely easier than trying to buy from Carvana, or even a dealership for that matter. That notion is supported across Reddit as well.

Shift is rapidly stealing market share from Carvana, yet is valued at only 600mil to Carvanas 49Bil valuation. I think Shift has been mainly overlooked since it was part of the recent several-month long de-SPAC slaughter.

Shift reports earnings today after market close. I implore you, dont miss this opportunity.

From what I researched back then, it was going to be the only non-ADR US stock with direct exposure to the insane transpacific-eastbound markets, and they happen to be Israeli-owned, making them a potential long-term hold for stability purposes (no matter what happens, commodities will always need to move). They're almost exclusively a charter business with relatively low market share, which can be a pro and a con. The biggest con is that they're leasing vessels for long periods of time and don't actually own them, but the pro is that this provides them with a great deal of flexibility to adapt and ""Go where the market goes"" on a long-term. I've been holding for a minute and have some ITM calls expiring early next year that I'm happily watching.

As always, however, it is important to manage risk as these runs tend to be climactic. The inflow in calls, which was much higher than puts as you can see below, helped support the uptrend. Ironically, the total net premium tends to peak at the top of the run. Another leg up matched with some mega-flow should be a sign that things might reverse.

As far as I can see DKNG periodically has nice run-ups (and retractions).

Lets set aside fantasies about manipulation.  The fact is that stocks go up when there is buying and accumulation, and they go down when there is selling.

Goodmorning traders, Happy veterans' day to all the veterans. Every day I come into the trading day trying to be objective, I am not a Perma bull or a Perma bear, I trade what I see that day. There are fundamental keys that make it hard to not lean with a bearish bias, but on the way up fundamentals dontreally matter. There are 2 stocks that have a choke hold on the market, Nvidia and Tesla. As Nvidia and Tesla goes, so goes the market. Can the irrational activity in these two stocks keep pace or does it end with a massive unwinding. Right now, these two stocks unwound a bit and ran so far so fast to the down side that they now have to catch their breath. In the title I made a pun about market breadth as seeing how it had no bearing on the market. Usuallymarket breadth (the number of stocks ticking up versus ticking down) is good way to measure market strength. However, when you have some of the largest market caps with a volatility of over 75% moving at a beta of one and a half times the market you get a condition where 450 stocks in the S&amp;P could be moving up but with these few stocks moving down, the market follows the few giving us miss leading market breadth. A very positiveadvance decline line with a market down close to .8%, beware of big tech. Also, now we have a clear momentum change on the daily chart. All keys to a bearish bias. With all that said I smell a bounce coming together. 

Now fortoday'sscenarios...

1) range day bias as we build energy for an even bigger move in the near future. This range day will be all over the place possibly endingwith a bullish tilt to it. We establish primary high of 465 area then establish a primary low of 462 and possibly over shooting to 461 area. Then we could quite possible end the day pushing and stretching the range day high to a new level. **42% probability** 

2) trend day up structure. We open gap up moving to fill the gap back to 463.62 finding support around this area. We get a reverse in trend mid-morning back to the up side first target of 466.79. Getting our midday chop along the way giving way to a slight pull back before resuming the morning primary trend. **38% probability** 

3) rounded reversal (trange day). We open up gaining momentum to the up side (gap and go). We head toward a target of 466.79/467 area then reaching our midday chop before reversing back down. Remember in this scenario the clue is a diverging indicator almost from the beginning of cash open. **20% probability**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrluqx/warming_up_but_let_me_catch_my_breadth_111121/

But here comes the kicker! You can cancel the Subscription INSTANTLY after starting your trail and Amazon will pay me 10$ for absolutely nothing! You also won't spend a single penny! It is free money lying on the floor around waiting to get collected!

&amp;#x200B;

So in theory it will just take 100.000 degenerates of WallStreetBets to start a trail, cancel it and help me to become a Millionaire with the age of 22 and make Jeff Bezos lose $1.000.000. And there is no Limit to the Top!

I would never ask for anything from random Degenerates in the WallstreetBets Subreddit. But this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to become a Millionaire in under a Month when this Post blows up!!

# [Stock futures inch higher after sell-off induced by hot inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures inched higher in early morning trading on Thursday following a tech-driven sell-off on Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 40 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Disney shares fell more than 5% in premarket trading after the media giant missed on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Disney+ subscribers also came in short of estimates.
*****
&gt; The major averages dipped on Wednesday after a hot inflation report pushed up bond yields. The rise in yields especially pressured growth pockets of the market.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240 points. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.7% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
&gt; The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 dropped 1.6% on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Fresh economic data released Wednesday showed persistent inflation. The consumer price index, which tracks a basket of products ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents, rose 6.2% in October from a year ago, hitting its highest level in three decades. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.9% against the 0.6% estimate.
*****
&gt; Inflation remains stubbornly high, to the surprise of many that expected prices to come back to earth sooner, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. The truth is you cant shut down a $20 trillion economy and not feel some bumps as it restarts, but we are hopeful the supply chain issues will resolve over the coming quarters and inflation should calm down as well.
*****
&gt; Following the CPI data, traders moved up their expectations for when the first Fed rate hike would occur. The Fed funds futures market now sees greater odds of the central banks first full rate hike coming in July 2022.

&gt; **Walt Disney (DIS)**  Disney shares fell nearly 5% in early morning trading Thursday after missing top and bottom-line estimates for its third-quarter results. The media giant reported a profit of 37 cents per share on revenue of $18.53 billion, compared with analyst estimates of 51 cents per share on revenue of $18.79 billion, according to Refinitiv. Subscriptions for Disney+ also feel short of estimates.

Started with a little over $5k in shares, looking to build out to over $25k today.

As a biopharma investor, here's what I see:
-Heavy insider/institutional ownership of float. Volume could lead to gamma squeeze (which is why I'm in shares and not options), which could also lead to a short squeeze.
-Hints at partnership with at least three major pharma players. This could quickly lead to a BO, via a bidding war, mostly for their highly-efficient novel drug delivery system.
-Possible sale of current therapeutics in the works.
-Earnings indicates financial streamlining (trimming of fat), which often precludes an M&amp;A deal in speculative bios.

Both of the above should push down the demand for long term bonds, and should push up yields and tank bond prices. 

The next CPI numbers get released on the 10th of December and the FOMC is scheduled to meet on the 14-15th of December. This is gonna make a shit storm of a couple days if the predictions I make are at least somewhat correct. We saw a 1% rise in yields just from the inflation data and the auction results. If the FED decides to hike rates, this could be 1.5% - 2% change over that 5 day period. 

What I'm trying to figure out is what is the optimal way to play this. Ofcourse we have bond futures that we could short. Then there's puts on the futures too, but again, it all depends on the optimal risk-reward ratio. I will take on massive amounts of risk, if the upside potential is equally huge.

Palantir Government Share vs Global Market share

In this post I will share current share of Government contracts for the year 2021 vs global market share in Software to really understand the value that Palantir can unlock in global markets.

It seems with the hire of over a 100 sales employees, We are on a roll for great growth in the future:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Market share from Government contracts 658 M](https://preview.redd.it/m1v9q5ckcyy71.png?width=865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb5f49ba58aa7819bdb3632e4856b69c131ef032)

 

Palantir 2021 revenue share from Government contracts is 658 M USD almost 0.6 % of total global market share of 108 B in Software services, Not to forget that these spending are expensive and inefficient just by looking on how governments are unsuccessful with dealing with current day challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Government spending on Software 118 B](https://preview.redd.it/t2or5ebncyy71.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36d219db367b0b8e572518ba709ee979197d7584)

If Palantir can further capture market share in the market, for example by 10% in the next 5 years - that will be an incremental of 10B in revenue from government contracts on annual basis.

With compliments of a commercial revenue growth to match the government segment putting total revenue at 20B annual revenue.

In the future, government budgets will continue to address recovery and growth needs of communities and businesses. In addition, investments to address digital equity and access to remote government services will be prioritized.

Currently pacing at 1 B in revenue, Papa Karp surprisingly within second 20 of the video link below he mentions that there is no reason this company shouldn't be 20 times bigger.

If you just climbed out of hibernation, you have some catching up to do. After I had posted the [first part](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnhy0t/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla/) of my DD on Friday and Elon had decided to get some marketing credit on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088?s=20), he began exercising his due options and selling shares to cover his tax bill. In Part 2 I look at his SEC filings and track his progress.

Interesting tidbit: a trading plan for an orderly sale has been in place since Sep 14, 2021^((1)). It puts into question the motives for the Twitter poll, or at least it should for those who still think it was not a marketing tactic.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not have time right now nor feel very comfortable with doing a forecast, but I am now expecting:

1. All 2012 award options to be exercised by the end of the year (no short-term impact, Tesla is getting \~$143M from Elon, shareholders get 2.2% dilution).
2. The supposed plan calls for an orderly sale, so it would make sense to keep the 	current pace, never selling more than 5% of the daily volume per day. That gives us a low-bound of 6 more sell-off days like Nov 9 left with a daily moves of -12%. The high-bound is at least 4 more tranches of 3-day periods like we just experienced spread out timewise, but still completed until the end of 2022Q1.

2 There is a question on how many options are to be exercised. For now, I am sticking with the 2020FY number from my original thesis, although the current SEC filing puts the number \~2.5M higher.

Ready for the gamma squezee !!!,Potential_Permit_436,"Root grows dramatically yesterday after closing the market and announcing the financial results, with a considerable increase in revenue to 204 M (v.s 170 M estimates) and an EPS of - 0.53 (v.s. - 0.69 estimates). And this is just the beginning ... The partnership with Carvana $CVNA will develop in the 4th quarter, and many cars sold by Carvana will have an advantageous Root insurance package, and Root sales will double soon ... 

I am glad that Root will shut the mouths of many who blamed this company, Root being one of the most sorted (48% SI) shares in the last 8 months, making the share decrease by 83% (from  27$ to  4.60 $) .... Root has been permanently attacked and sabotaged because it is the first tech insurance company to revolutionize the insurance market, and this has bothered many ... 

We are also waiting for the partnership with Tesla $TSLA, which after a long time managed to authorize its own insurance (similar to Root) only in one state (Texas). Elon, instead of wasting years with permits in all states, you can turn to Root because in 2022 they will have coverage throughout the US ... 

Also yesterday, Root announced the initiation of a discussion with BlackRock for a financing line, in this way Root will develop more and will preserve the cash he has now (approximately 1 billion). 

I estimate that Root after Q4 will reach 30$ per share, and starting with Q1 2022 it is possible to see the first quarterly profit, and Root will explode over  50$ per share ..... 

!!! Listen today the earnins call that will be held until the opening of the market, there will be many news about the partnership with Carvana and possibly even Tesla, we will see ....

1,"11/11/2021, 12:45:12",DON'T FALL FOR FEAR-MONGERING,kviehdor,"There as been a lot of negative press over the past week about potential ""crashes,"" inflation, etc. Remember back to Chomsky and Manufacturing Consent to recognize that corporations always sell ideas that are profitable. I am a firm believer that the elite control markets in their own ways, and will always look for ways to screw over the working class investors and the likes of us at WSB.
Historically, one could say that large hedge funds and elites actually prefer cyclical bear markets and occasional crashes because they are the most opportune times to organize and control the environment of the working class. In these last two months of the year, there is too much potential economic loss for the elite to justify a major selloff so quickly. I believe the short-term fear-mongering will likely cool off because these tiny cycles can be used as huge leverage by forcing major selloffs from easily-swayed investors. If we look at cycles of crashes and bear markets, the most likely ""catalyst"" months are February, March, and October.
This isn't me attempting 5th dimension quantum analysis; it just seems to be incredibly simple application of societal motivations and historical cycles. 
Just hold the line through the holidays would be my bet based off of these acknowledgements.

In case you haven't heard, the third biggest bnpl in the USA (Quadpay) was globalized under the name **Zip** a few months back and also took on a whole new logo under the rebranding.

Now  I know some of you are onto this as over 700mn Zip shares were bought in the USA on OTC in the last few months but here's what you don't know-  JPMorgan Chase are committed to shorting this share down to nothing in order to smash bnpl into non-existence.

Look, the numbers on Zip are good but what has crushed the SP is that JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that he 'is willing to spend whatever it takes to battle BNPL'. For any money that JPMorgan Chase loses by shorting a share they own, they prolong their old banking/lending  investments.

The more the share is  smashed, the more likely it is that Zip won't be able to raise further capital to deliver the wipe out to the old credit card model. Not that Zip needs to raise capital but, the standing or status of the share is being injured by the actions of big players wanting to destroy newer upstart credit models.

So as I write, the share has dropped in price by about 5% in 48hrs from  Australian $6.20 down to $5.73  And here's a sample of the manipulating  that is going on by the big players as JPMC might well buy back in again next week in a bid to do more damage:

It makes no sense that in the last year Afterpay went from less than $10 to around $140 before being bought out, as Zip's a business with good fundamentals and growing profits- it should be around $90 SP to me. 

This Christmas will be Zip's best ever with marketing that is laser focused on ladies with jobs who like to spend on quality upmarket branded goods. The numbers are there (DYOR) for all to see.

Sure, it's not that much money to most of you guys (or even to me), but still, it's not fun to realize that I've wasted more than 10 hours of work for nothing. Anyways, here's a few lessons I got from that trade:

- Options can be way riskier than stocks if you haven't done extensive research on the company in question. Only buy them if you're really confident that the stock will behave the way you predict it to. And they're not made to YOLO your entire savings into either, as much as you're confident with the future behaviour of a particular stock.

- Not only invest only the money you can afford to lose, but also the money you're ready to lose without then having a psychological breakdown. I'm personally cannot sleep restfully knowing my money is unsafe, so I'm gonna stay with overall safe stocks and maybe play with 1/10 of my money.

- As some of you stated, the stock market is a big casino for the most part. The winners will most often get the losers' money. Like gambling, it can become really addictive too, so you have to cool your head after big losses and not try to get deeper into risky stuff to cover them.

https://preview.redd.it/fs7gzbu5xvy71.jpg?width=419&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3afdaaa3c81f33fe409e66212b230eae8fcc7ff

Ok, listen apes, lets just put $TSLA aside for the sake of this argument as it is an outliner and Im not saying $F nor $GM should be given a valuation similar to $TSLA. Its obvious they cant as they dont have king Elon.

Today, Rivian just went public (Nov 11th) and jump from $78 to over $100 per share valuing the company over $85B. It is worth more than $F ($77B) and as much as $GM($86B).  Even $LCID ($65B) is almost as valuable as $F. Yet, Rivian (and $LCID)  is operating at a loss, sold way less EVs than these two legacy auto companies, yet wallstreets are giving them a way higher and richer valuation than these two.

So whats gives?  It appear wallstreets are not interested in their boring and old internal combustion engine (ICE) products, no matter how profitable they are.  As long as ICE are lumped into EVs, $F and $GM can never be seen as a tech and/or growth company as ICE is old technology. Since ICE currently generates the bulk of its revenue and profit, this makes it really hard (and confusing) for wallstreet to see them as a tech company to give it a higher valuation.  Therefore, to exponentially unlock hundreds of billions of dollars from these two, they need to be spun off, or split from their parent company. As you probably know by now, $GE is beginning to realize that and is planning to split in 3 after a couple decades of being a one-size fit all giant.  United Technologies split up a while back to become Otis, Carrier and Raytheon (through merger) and the sum of these 3 surely worth more than they are combined. 

**So How?**

Take $GM as an example.  Morgan Stanleys Adam Jonas once describe what he call SPACtopus (see image below) and how he believed if GM spin off any of these divisions, theyll have discrete value and perhaps worth more separately.  ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-gm-spa-ctopus-taking-on-ev-market-185152539.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-gm-spa-ctopus-taking-on-ev-market-185152539.html))

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t2uwsav9xvy71.jpg?width=705&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47a1a737f5129f7f8a814e04a86ebd930bdd2b89

Obviously, the Cruise and EV/Ultium divisions at least would be given a higher valuation as they would be considered a growth tech.  As long as legacy businesses are lump in with the tech it is too hard for wallstreet to value the company as a whole.

The stand-alone EV division of $GM and  $F  SHOULD be worth more than Rivian. Now since even if $GM or$F spin off their EV division, this separate division will likely operate as a loss. So it would be hard to compare and value them with Rivian (also operating as a loss) on EPS. How about if we value them based on their sales or backlog of orders to show growth? After all, growth is what companies get reward for on wallstreets.

Now for comparison sake, let's consider $F EV division only (excluding ICE, financial, etc) and Rivian.  Rivian  delivered so far.. 50? 60? trucks and have backlog order of 55,000 trucks + 100,000 Amazon vans.  $F have already delivered over 47,000 Mustang Mach E  EV to date and last month sold over 2,800+ Mache E.  Then there are 160,000+ pre-order/backlog for the F-150 Lightning and an unknown sold out number of electric Transit Connect.

Based on the numbers of EV deliveries and backlog orders alone (forget about profit/revenue for now as both are likely to be unprofitable for the time being), without question $F EV as a stand alone company will be worth more than Rivian.  And on top of that all the other divisions of $F are just icing on the cake. As ridiculous as it may sound, $F EV division as a stand alone is worth even more than all the $F combined. Think about that for a second. Because as a combined company wallstreets find it really hard to evaluate $F growth. As a stand alone, wallstreets can see clearly how $F EV is growing compare to sat Rivian.

**The Plan to Unlock Value in $F and $GM: Pull an Eugine No. 1**

If you dont know what Eugine No. 1 is, they are an unheard of activist firm that took a tiny stake in Exxon Mobil $XOM and force it to fight climate change and reduce carbon emission. Really? Yes, and Im not kidding:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/engine-no-1-takes-climate-fight-to-other-big-oil-companies-after-underdog-win-at-exxon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/engine-no-1-takes-climate-fight-to-other-big-oil-companies-after-underdog-win-at-exxon.html)

They do this by winning the proxy vote and elect directors/board seats who will advocate for the changes they want.  Now that Eugine No 1 has won out, $XOM has no choice but to come up with some plan to fight climate change.  Had Eugine No 1 not done this, $XOM would have not tried hard like other oil companies such as Shell or BP, going more green or investing in cleaner energies which both companies have.

So what we really need to do is pull an Eugine No 1. Somehow we need to put up a proxy vote. We could, but not necessarily nominate a board member, but can put up a resolution (i.e. spin off or separate EV business) which can also be impactful.  As shareholders we are owners of the company and publicly traded companies have to report to their shareholders. If a majority of shareholders agrees, it will force the companys hand.  

I cant speak for everyone, but if those of you apes who agree with me that both $F and $GM is a value trap, we can help to unlock shareholder values by forcing the company to do so.  $GM may be easier to force to change as $F has a voting structure in which the family owns a huge chuck of votes.  However, even if we lose the proxy vote, any news/rumors of spinning off the EV division (even if it is not going to happen) will definitely push shares higher. So it is a win-win even if we win or lose.

Now you apes have been known to do the impossible, like sending stocks that hedge funds and analysis say are worthless or a piece of shit ( $GME and $AMC ), to the moon.  We can do this, if enough apes buy shares in $F and $GM and someone proposes a spin-off on a proxy vote resolution.  If enough apes on /WSB agrees, we can make the changes and finally unlock hidden values in $F and $GM. Im more than sure that there are a lot of other shareholders who agree, but we need an ape to pull an Engine No 1 to get the ball rolling.

Or my personal favorite when we would release shrimp or other sea creatures and watch their frantic-lunatic movements to discern if we should do calls or puts?

Well those days are sadly gone.  Maybe some day those great days will return :)

It was these times and before that we use to have really complex DD and some cool ass complex moves when it came to options and betting.  This sub was fucking the shit back then :)

Then PRPL came around.

It was like crack.. It was kind of the first time the forum got completely memorized by a meme.  It was way before the ape days, way before the I WISH I had a gun to shoot myself days, way before even the silver surfers (SLV).

We had guys like dhsmatt2 who was a pretty interesting character.

I noticed about a month ago what seemed to be a lot of shill accounts and posts related to PRPL.

I also noticed today it broke a very important resistance point.

So for those that like to remember the good old days what does this bring to mind?

For those of you that held calls to long R.I.P.

For those of you that held puts may your gay bear pimp juice cups always be full.

1,"11/11/2021, 09:59:12",$wish A deep value bet thesis,RestaurantShort5833,"Valued at a fraction of what their peers are on a P/S basis.
Their revenue almost equals their market cap.
They have virtually no debt with upwards of 1.7 billion in cash.
Currently at 1/4 of IPO price.
Over 100 million active monthly users.

In this article I will be laying out why I believe this company is massively undervalued and deserves to be closer to its IPO price if not higher. I will also go over things that we currently know as well as comparing this stock to its peers on a P/S basis.

Comparison To Peers:

Below is a list with the revenue and market caps of the closest peers for comparison purposes. If we go off of this alone, we see that Wish is drastically undervalued compared to any peers, even the weaker peers such as Etsy have over a 10x P/S valuation while Wish barely has a 1x P/S ratio. If we were to get a rock bottom fair valuation of 10x P/S, we would be at around $50.00 per share.

Keep in mind that with this comparison, Wish has virtually no debt and close to 1.7 billion in cash available. Yes that is correct, its not a typo, Wish has half of its market cap in cash.

$SE $4.2B Revenue, $192B MC

$MELI $3.9B Revenue , $75B MC

$SHOP $2.9B Revenue, $175B MC

$ETSY $1.7B Revenue, $27B MC

$WISH $2.5B Revenue, $3B MC

Paid Advertisements Appear To Be Back

It looks like the company is utilizing paid advertisements based on some of the popular and reliable SEO tools. We have also seen Google advertisements directly so we know that paid ads are back.

Logistics Business Taking Off Like A Rocket!

Wish Local is expanding at an incredible rate and with Wish Local the company is at a severe advantage over traditionally online retailers as their warehousing costs are significantly lower. The logistics portion of the business generated over 228 million dollars in revenue last quarter alone, up over 100% year over year.

The Dollar Store Of The Internet

One of the more common arguments I have come across is the quality of some of their products (which they are launching several initiatives to improve). When I hear this though the first thing that comes to mind is the typical ""dollar stores"" and how quickly they have grown.

If there is no demand for these level quality products, then why are there 5 Dollar General stores within 15 minutes of my home?

Summary

In summary I believe this is one of those rare opportunities to own something that will be absolutely massive in the future. Wish is currently going for 1/4 of their IPO price meaning just a return to this would be a 400% return but long term this should grow to be valued even higher than that. My opinion is that this will someday become one of those ""I wish I would of bought it at $5"" stocks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qra3v9/wish_a_deep_value_bet_thesis/

Overall launch window ranges from the 11th-24th of this month with possible launch imminent around 8:30pm West Coast or 11:30 pm East Coast Time. What the fuck does this have to do with Palantir? Well here comes BlackSky.. not only can you invest cheaper than that fucking Maven Alex Karp that we all love and drastically hate,  (BlackSky current price $9.96 he bought $8 million at $10.00 ) but Palantir is the actual Metaverse not joining with Facebook (Ill never say Schmeta) and not even Zucky McRobotFace knows this but with Blackskywho serves to create near real time geospatial intelligence for its select customer base (National Reconnaissance  Office             
 and other benevolent 3 letter agencies) plus varying vetted public customers. Again what the fuck does that have to do with Palantir? Well if youve noticed from any of the presentations, PLTR seems to always mention and strives to create sensor fusion presented in a manageable way for customers (Military Industrial Complex) to make informed decisions. BlackSky is one of those steps to success Seeking to NETwork the SKY, Palantir and BlackSky have partnered together to put the Gotham program in space Thats right this SkyNet will be powered by Palantirs incredible data analytics and fusion programs, with BlackSkys networked near real time global monitoring capability through its satellite constellation..           Forget about the Schmetaverse with Facebook, thats for holding your fake boyfriends fake dong in a fake world Palantir is creating the metaverse in REAL TIME to protect Western interests and to annihilate anyone that even curls a lip in our direction Sensor Fusion (Metaverse) is the future..Today is one small step for Man and another big step to killing people and tracking the idiots who show up at their funerals more efficiently.. Palantir, RocketLab, BlackSky a brighter tomorrow, for Us. 

TLDR: Rockets Fly.. Moon Soon 

As always, please make informed decisions. You are a brilliant and wonderfully sculpted person on the inside and outside, launches fail and people can paper hand on 103% commercial growth (PLTR) your choices are your happy own.

(linked at the bottom)  Note: Elon sold 934,091 shares on Monday, he has about 18,000,000 more to sell and will likely do so this year.  Unfortunately because Tesla is heavily weighted in the S&amp;P 500 that means the volatility he has created will keep VIX elevated so we're looking at some wild days.  It's not that there won't be a Santa Rally but we have to be more careful.  FYI - watch the SEC filings, if he's selling every day we'll start seeing the filings.  Now, if he is selling every day people may panic and tank the price. I'm tired but will dig in more later.  Of interest might be that people think he is done so we could be in for some wild swings in Tesla itself.

What we are currently seeing is a trend of investors waiting for earnings releases and if they are not absolutely amazing - investors choose to park reallocate their assets in safer or different investments that might including more mature companies or even transferring out that money in cash. 

General market outlook is not extremely positive, with high inflation, some supply chain hurdles, and no more of that pandemic money. People are starting to travel, go out, and spend the money they saved up during the pandemic - which for the period of COVID could be allocated towards investments in stocks.

Less and less do you see companies that are losing millions get rewarded and valued at insane multiples - sure there are still hinders fo examples like Tesla and even Rivian today, but as you see from earnings over the past two weeks, a major sel off happens if companys performance doesnt follow insane growth trajectory. 

Overall, I would say that the markets have been going ham since March of 2020, and now that inflation is stopping fed from dumping insane amounts of money on asset repurchases, we will see capital dry up in the capital markets, leading to lower valuations and possibly some rapid crashes over the next few months.

With rising prices many retail investors will need to decide how much money they can allocate into the stock market if they cant afford to put Gus in their car. 

I am not a gay bear and most of my positions are long, but we are definitely seeing a shift in the markets, and I think this is worth a discussion. 

Many of you fuckers started stonk trading in the past year or two, and have not seen or felt a major crash yet.

Mulling around a new strategy

I just bought as many CRL Nov 18 2022 calls as I could get my hands on at the $660 strike in my Roth. 75% OTM!  

As we all know, Tesla has had a huge increase in price due to Elon Musk owning 20% of the stock, and dumb money large passive indexes buying the rest, ever since it joined the S&amp;P 500. As the TSLA share price increases, the index fund inflows buy more and more stock in a continuous feedback loop!

Huge passive S&amp;P 500 ETF inflows are ALSO triggering a melt up in Charles River Laboratories, just like Tesla!! And CRL has a 20B market cap instead of 1T!

Take a look at the ownership of CRL by index funds. Super high relative to other S&amp;P 500 companies.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRL/holders?p=CRL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRL/holders?p=CRL)

The 1 year and 5 year charts of CRL look exactly like one INSANE TORRENT of ETF buying through out the past several years, especially 2021, which has been setting records already! Very consistently going up, just like Tesla. Just take a look at the stock during trading hours. It goes up 90% of the time, minus a couple large losses on poor earning reporting days. 

Basically, the theory is that it will increase 100% next year, due to continual inflows, not due to fundamentals. Just like Tesla. And then the calls will be worth about 35x's what you paid for them a year from now. 

And the best part is that you get to front run all those dumb money record setting size passive index fund inflows on super cheap options!!

* As a scorching inflation reading roiled financial markets, US stocks plunged the most in a month and bond yields surged higher.
* After a 30-year treasury auction yielded greater than expected, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, extending earlier losses. Two-year yields also jumped as statistics revealed the fastest annual inflation rate since 1990, upending bets on when the Fed will raise rates next.
* The Nasdaq 100 led markets lower, as its highly valued tech members are thought to be the most vulnerable to inflation. The dollar reached a 52-week high, oil fell more than 3%, and gold rose.
* Stocks and bonds are becoming riskier as persistently high inflation forces the Federal Reserve to taper at a quicker pace or raise interest rates sooner than expected.
* The consumer price index in the US jumped 6.2% in October, exceeding predictions of 5.9%.
* Yellen restated her belief that high inflation in the US will not last beyond next year, and that the Fed will not accept price increases similar to those seen in the 1970s. Traders are concerned that the recent data may be enough to persuade the Fed to increase rates as soon as June 2022, when it will have completed tapering its asset-purchase programme.
* The five-year breakeven rate on government inflation-protected securities in the US hit a new high. In the meantime, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose 13 basis points to 1.56%.

I have been doing some thinking.

Small cap tends to move with large cap (SPY) but just has more volatility. If you want to see more potential upside in your bets, why not use small cap ETFs like IWO? 

I have slowly built a larger small cap position over time and am confident on this for long term index investing. You could basically just hold SPY for 40 years and do just fine. But if were so confident on the long term appreciation of SPY, why wouldnt you take the larger upside with IWO (which has historically outperformed SPY).

**Gravity $GRVY**

Its a south Korean gaming company that mainly focusing on the Ragnarok IP, and recently launched their latest version to North America. It Asian so the P/E ratio is much lower than western peers, even though it just has about 2-3% of revenue coming from mainland China. For the moment

 Market Cap 724,604,886 USD

P/E Ration 10.5

They have very solid finances cash200 M USD profitable, check this for quick overview

[https://www.gravity.co.kr/en/ir/pds/download.asp?curseq=144&amp;curfileSeq=1](https://www.gravity.co.kr/en/ir/pds/download.asp?curseq=144&amp;curfileSeq=1)

Another reason for the low price is unknown company in a region where its hard to extract information. Also they are not investing they strong cash position to increase there growth.

**The case**

The company had a good 2020, with new releases. (they make a game then release it on different market, like SAE, Japan, Korea, NA, Europe). First half of 2021 there was no new releases and the Revenue decreased as well as the stock price.  (toped at about 220 USD and high volume). 

However, in June new game was released in Japan and South Asia. A twitter user follow the data on sensor tower them each month so u get a relative good picture of rev and until now it been pretty accurate.[https://twitter.com/SickValue/status/1455862706377039874](https://twitter.com/SickValue/status/1455862706377039874)

&amp;#x200B;

If we compare this to the reported quarter, we can see it pretty accurate (relative number)

Rev Q2(2021) (US$ 73,965 thousand) (04,05,06)

Rev Q1(2021) (US$ 93,243 thousand) (01,02,03)

RevQ4(2020) (US$ 95,000  thousand)  (10,11,12)

&amp;#x200B;

More and more pay using3 part payment so the number cant be translated directly but it gives a picture of the trend. If this is correct and PC and 3 part payment stay on same level Q3 should have a revenue in line with Q3 (2021)(some part are PC and is not shown I the graph, Q3 2020 PC was a bit bigger)

**The short squeeze**

Secondly what makes it interesting is that recently the short interest increased to record level 

Short interest increased to  113K shares (About 4 days avg volume).

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/grvy/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/grvy/short-interest)

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/grvy/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/grvy/institutional-holdings)

This is a low float and low volume stock Institutional holding is 10% and one mayor holder Gungho is holding 60%, ie out of 6.9M shared we got about 2.1M on the market which is about 3% of the free float, not much but can be a squish if the report is as good as I tink.

Quarter report November 11,   as one can see now Q3 looks stronger than ever, if just PC side does OK it should be in pair with 2020.  Also the line-up for the coming month is strong, they are making classic remake, they are making NBA game etc.  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gravity-revealed-g-star-2021-100000095.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gravity-revealed-g-star-2021-100000095.html)

The covavax NVAX vaccine-induced heart inflammation of any severity still warrants concern, especially without a known root cause. Myocarditis and pericarditis skewed to kill more boys than females.    
The number of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis reported with the vaccines in the UK remains to  continue to closely affect more young adults these events reported in the UK and internationally. Symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis can vary but often include shortness of breath, a forceful heartbeat that may be irregular, and chest pain. Heart inflammation is a complication seen to stop heart beat.  Novavax will almost certainly fall short of its hopes to position with COVAVAX as the long-awaited FAILURE ADDED TO LIST Synagis (palivizumab), leaving the market for competitors to have market share. The major clinical update expecting, Novavax, vaccine ongoing study show in pregnant women to make issues with birth.  Irregular effects on birth from vaccine by manufacturing having low standards caused unexpected delays from the process of contaminated vials.  

In short, Novavax released a nothing burger  -- drawing the ire of investors that bought this stock in anticipation of a more robust news event. Unfortunately, it's commonplace for companies like Novavax, that are struggling to meet the standards. Novavax has No FDA approval. So until then, it might be best to simply watch this developmental-stage biotech from the safety of the sidelines.

This week there will be a couple of posts with the top companies based on their performance over the last week. I track various indirect companies' metrics to spot the sharp increases/decreases which may affect the price of the stocks.

In this post, I've analyzed the most discussed companies on Twitter over the last week. Some companies have posted their Q3 reports on November 4th, which caused lots of social activity around the tickers. It's a nice indicator for making the investments - the more positive/negative social discussions around the company's ticker - the more chances to see the change in its stock.

**1. Fat Brands Inc. (**[**$FATBB**](https://contora.ai/ticker/FATBB)**)** \- a multi-brand restaurant franchising company. It develops, markets, and acquires predominantly fast casual and casual dining restaurant concepts.

$FATBB shares skyrocketed almost 200% and were halted at some point of the day after the company announced it was purchasing Fazoli's restaurant chain for $130M. The shares appeared to be jumping after mentions on social media such as StockTwits, with some mentioning the stock's low float and lack of shares available to short. Keep a closer eye on this stock this week as well, the traders say that its a runner with a nice dividend.

**2. Qurate Retail Inc. (**[**$QRTEA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/QRTEA)**)** \- the company is engaged in the video and online commerce industries.

The company has announced its Q3 earnings results on Thursday, November 4th, where its revenue decreased 7% to $3.1 billion. While there are near-term industry challenges to work through, I couldnt be more excited about the long-term opportunity at Qurate Retail to accelerate growth and drive shareholder value, said David Rawlinson, President and CEO of Qurate Retail

But what's the point of studying when there are only candles to look at?! Just like you would on your birthday, close your eyes, wish for the best, but instead of blowing out your candles, we're going to blow through the your cash by buying into a volatile green candle. We call this ""FOMO,"" because you don't miss out if you're not in!

A slew of green candles will flash before your eyes and it's the sign of ""CHA-CHING,"" MONEY being made, but the only thing you're going to get out of it is a nice, long, red candle right kicking your assets. -20% loss, but 100% lesson learned!

Some of you asked how was I able to obtain such an amazing feat by losing my entire account in such a short period. Well, ""to make money, you have to spend money,"" but if I learned anything from university, government spending and economics, is spending money and building a nice portfolio of debt.

I'd like to thank my contributors $KERN and $KMX for existing in the stock market. A special shout out to:

Kern $4.20 cost/sh ($8k) loss: Bought after hours 

147c KMX 10/15 (11k) loss: Bought a few days before earnings and riding it all the way down as one of the biggest gap downs on the market that day.

The rest of me entire balances were lost in minor accidents and are still missing 'til this day. If you have any information about their whereabouts, please contact ""congratulations and fuck you."" 

&amp;#x200B;

**^(\*After posting my losses and receiving both positive and negative feedback, I've come to terms with it and accept my ill fate. It doesn't mater what people think, say or do because it boils down to what you want to evaluate and take from your life experiences. Take people's kind words and soak them up as much as possible. If you're going to repeat about criticism or thoughts, allow them to be productive and uplifting because nobody is coming to save you. Once you're alone and dealing with every day life, it is your mentality, emotions and actions that will get you through it all. Good luck and trade better than I did.)**

1,"11/11/2021, 04:59:30",Weekly monsters: top 5 most discussed companies on Twitter over the last week,vilnitskiy,"Hi everyone! This week there will be a couple of posts with the top companies based on their performance over the last week. I track various indirect companies' metrics to spot the sharp increases/decreases which may affect the price of the stocks. 

In this post, I've analyzed the most discussed companies on Twitter over the last week. Some companies have posted their Q3 reports on November 4th, which caused lots of social activity around the tickers. It's a nice indicator for making the investments - the more positive/negative social buzz around the company's ticker - the more chances to see the change in its stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Fat Brands Inc. (**[**$FATBB**](https://contora.ai/ticker/FATBB)**)** \- a multi-brand restaurant franchising company. It develops, markets, and acquires predominantly fast casual and casual dining restaurant concepts.

$FATBB shares skyrocketed almost 200% and were halted at some point of the day after the company announced it was purchasing Fazoli's restaurant chain for $130M. The shares appeared to be jumping after mentions on social media such as StockTwits, with some mentioning the stock's low float and lack of shares available to short. Keep a closer eye on this stock this week as well, the traders say that its a runner with a nice dividend.

[$FATBB](https://preview.redd.it/t7wa1ud1sty71.png?width=1215&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69aa0da8c8617a59f929684d0aeffb023b8a7da)

**2. Deciphera Pharmaceuticals Inc. (**[**$DCPH**](https://contora.ai/ticker/DCPH)**)** \- a biotechnology company, which develops and manufactures kinase-inhibiting drugs for the treatment of cancers and immunological diseases.

The social buzz was caused by Deciphera announcing the results of its [Phase 3 QINLOCK study](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-did-deciphera-stock-plunge-124010791.html). Keep in mind, this is the key drug candidate the company has in its pipeline. For investors in DCPH stock, this was a big blow because now it isnt Decipheras only drug. However, investors clearly had forecasted a significant amount of long-term cash-flow growth on the basis of this drug being approved. Accordingly, this is a stock thats likely to continue its price discovery in the coming days.

[$DCPH](https://preview.redd.it/71wm1qu9sty71.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=919b1a7cae29958123eb74581db4d320d18e2618)

**3.  Qurate Retail Inc. (**[**$QRTEA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/QRTEA)**)** \- the company is engaged in the video and online commerce industries.

The company has announced its Q3 earnings results on Thursday, November 4th, where its revenue decreased 7% to $3.1 billion. While there are near-term industry challenges to work through, I couldnt be more excited about the long-term opportunity at Qurate Retail to accelerate growth and drive shareholder value, said David Rawlinson, President and CEO of Qurate Retail

[$QRTEA](https://preview.redd.it/otf83noesty71.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=326c407f6876e4712e48d9876065592c015ae1bc)

**4. Alpine Immune Science Inc. (**[**$ALPN**](https://contora.ai/ticker/ALPN)**)** \- is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. It is engaged in discovering and developing innovative, protein-based immunotherapies to treat cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc showed great current-quarter revenue growth of 945.50%.

[$ALPN](https://preview.redd.it/ol6e4t8jsty71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a85f2f198ac19900a3ed72ddfedec95c417c62d)

**5.** **US Foods Holdings Inc. (**[**$USFD**](https://contora.ai/ticker/USFD)**)** \- US Foods is the second-largest U.S. food-service distributor behind Sysco, holding a 10% market share of the highly fragmented food-service distribution industry.

[$USFD](https://preview.redd.it/0p4usutlsty71.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64fc98a5075f43563a66c31a5c7087e0299bc9b0)

I am big on this company. I am not rich so I only own around 180 shares.

I read their release for their third quarter earnings. They didn't realize a profit yet, but they reduced their debt to 0.

I understand they are still growing and are entering a competitive market, but my novice mind doesn't comprehend why they would be down 8 percent after the below.

**Comstock Announces Third Quarter 2021 Results and Business Update6:45 AM ET 11/10/21 | GlobeNewswire**Comstock Announces Third Quarter 2021 Results and Business Update

Commercializing Breakthroughs in both Lithium and Carbon Extractions

VIRGINIA CITY, Nev., Nov. 10, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comstock Mining Inc. (NYSE: LODE) (""Comstock"" and the ""Company""), a developer of advanced new clean technologies for use in meeting the rapidly increasing global demand for clean energy, carbon-neutrality, and natural products, today announced its unaudited financial results for the period ending September 30, 2021, and provided a business update.

""We are now enabling systemic decarbonization, that is our mission,"" said Corrado De Gasperis, Comstock's Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our acquisitions have assembled breakthrough clean technologies with intellectual property, operating systems, facilities and a senior management team focused on one goal: to accelerate decarbonization through self-sustaining, throughput generating businesses capable of exponential growth.""

Selected Strategic Highlights  
\-- Cellulosic Fuels. Acquired Plain Sight Innovations Corporation (""PSI"") with its first facility expected to scale up to an initial capacity exceeding 330,000 tons per year of forestry wastes over its first three years of operations, as it extracts and refines carbon-neutral woody biomasses into ethanol, biodiesel and marine fuels. -- Lithium-ion Battery Metal Recycling. Acquired the rights to a majority equity stake in LINICO Corporation, a lithium-ion battery (""LIB"") recycling company that owns the rights to a 100,000 ton per annum state-of-the-art battery metal recycling facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial (""TRI"") Center in Storey County, Nevada. -- Enabling Lithium Extraction. LINICO's facility and separation systems are designed for, and situated to, receive, crush and separate battery materials into high purity black mass, and is currently enabling a breakthrough, front-end lithium extraction technology. -- Engineering, Construction and Manufacturing. Acquired Renewable Process Solutions (RPS) with the direct engineering and construction management for engineering, manufacturing, and commissioning state of the art cellulosic fuel extraction facilities and unique LIB crushing, separating and lithium extraction solutions. -- Mineral Extraction and Remediation. Acquired fifty percent of MCU Philippines Inc. (MCU-P), currently operating in Monkayo, Davao de Oro, Philippines, as the Naboc River Rehabilitation begins full ramp up. -- Quantum Sensing and Material Generation. Acquired the rights to a fifty percent equity stake in Quantum Generative Materials LLC (GenMat), which is accelerating the generation of new materials for use in batteries, carbon capture and utilization, aerospace, and mining applications.  
""We are systemically strengthening our organization in ways that sustainably contribute to humanity's rapidly-escalating demand for increasingly scarce natural resources, including the strategic resources needed to fuel the worldwide surge in, and transition to, clean energy and carbon-neutrality,"" added DeGasperis. ""We have a singular focus on a few, breakthrough businesses that will lead in renewable minerals and fuels used mostly in transportation.""

\-- Total operating costs were $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, corresponding to a 13.9% decrease from the comparable prior period due to lower mining and mine claim costs and reclamation liability estimates, offset somewhat by higher selling, general and administrative costs. -- Net loss was $7.6 million, or a loss of $0.17 per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to net income of $18.3 million, or $0.63 per common share, for the comparable 2020 period. The 2021 loss primarily was the result of a $3.0 million loss from operations, versus a $3.9 million loss from operations for the comparable prior year period, a $2.7 million decrease in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities, and $2.2 million of unrealized losses on Tonogold common shares. The 2020 income was primarily attributed to the gain on the sale to Tonogold of the entity owning the Lucerne mine. -- Total assets increased to $107.4 million at September 30, 2021, a 149% increase from December 31, 2020; -- Total debt decreased to $0, a 100% decrease from year end 2020, as all debt obligations were extinguished; -- Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at September 30, 2021 was $3.4 million; and, -- Common shares outstanding at September 30, 2021, were 64,402,789.  
Mr. De Gasperis stated, ""We have transformed our balance sheet, enhanced our senior management, completely repositioned our system into renewable growth assets, significantly increased director and officer stock ownership, and aligned compensation with our shareholders. If we do not deliver, we do not vest, it's that simple.""

Focus on Value Creation from Throughput and Decarbonization

""Speed of cash generation and decarbonization are the lowest common denominators in each of our businesses,"" continued DeGasperis. ""Our team is focused on the tactical activities necessary to enable rapid and exponential financial, natural and social gains. We've structured each of our acquisitions to minimize dilution while positioning each line of business with its own cash, equity, and balance sheets, for this growth. We believe this will accelerate and exceed our pledge to sustainably deliver more than $12 per share by 2023. Frankly, we believe our existing platform is already worth multiples of that target based on comparable valuations.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr2q21/lode_third_quarter_earnings/

1,"11/11/2021, 03:47:34",Beyond Meat: A Nothing Burger that costs $6.3B,OrcaBull,"**Thesis:** Lifting of government restrictions in many places lets people get back to enjoying a dine-in experience at a restaurant and demand for at-home meal ingredients will soften. People for the past year were experimenting with exotic ingredients as they started cooking. This enthusiasm is weaning. The product is nothing unique. Veggie burgers have existed before humans formed civilizations. **They report after market today and I am betting on a post report collapse.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Evidence:** 

Exhibit A: August restaurant dining was 5% higher this year than last year. BYND reported a 14.3% drop in grocery sales for the second quarter, providing a concrete measure of the trend. Beef burger orders at restaurants increased 12% between June 2020 and June 2021 while orders for plant-based menu items have remained basically flat during that period.  Burger King, reported an approximately 50% drop in Impossible Whopper sales between its August 2019 launch and late 2020. Many start-ups are small, some major players with deep pockets are also getting in on the faux meat game.  The company also has virtually no margin because it sells products at a loss in a bid to secure shelf space and establish brand recognition. BYND doesnt have any kind of competitive advantage. 

Exhibit B: Is the house on fire? Former CFO Mark Nelson retired in May, while COO Sanjay Shah stepped down in early September, less than two years after joining.

Exhibit C: Drop in daily visitors to their site. Why? b/c customers don't need to look up info about a product that they are not buying.

Exhibit D: It's backed by sophisticated investors such as Snoop Dogg and Liza Koshy. We all know that they do extensive analysis. 

Exhibit E:  In November 2020, Beyond Meat announced sales had only grown by 2% year-on-year compared to an expected increase of 40% . They used Covid as scape-goat. Well, the evidence points at a fundamental problem at the business model. If I want a burger I would order a real one and if I want a vegetarian meal I would order a real vegetarian meal. 

Exhibit F: We are all looking for tendies! Fret no more they have you covered. They make chicken strips which journalist described as ""likeness to real chicken was tolerable, at best"", and the chicken product was discontinued in 2019.

1,"11/11/2021, 03:26:55",SOHU DD *chinese gaming,Pale-Championship-11,"**SOHU**

Chinese gaming and advertising company which offers advertising and gaming services.

Why it's undervalued:

* At a market cap of \~800m Sohu.com is undervalued.
* Net profit per quarter recently has been around \~45m and projected profit this year is around \~170m which would give it a p/e ratio of around 5. Not only is the p/e low, but this company could boom in years to come.
* Earnings are expected to rise significantly and a conservative price target would be around $26, a 30% upside.
* Revenue for 2021 is expected to be 20% higher than last year and the company is expected to finally turn a profit. The company has already beat EPS estimates and will be set for steller yearly earnings if the company can produce great results in Q3 earnings.
* The company also has over $349 million in cash on hand.
* Large margin.
* 3 billion in assets, 1.8 billion in liabilities.

Why it's a good long term play:

* Currently, Chinese tensions are high, institutional investors are wary of investing in china. There are two ways this situation could play out, China increases regulation in gaming and the internet sector, this would hurt sohu, but not bankrupt the company.
* This is a small cap company, the potential growth is important to keep in mind. Currently, the company has a lot of space to grow. As Chinese citizens start turning more and more to the internet, and the government is cracking down on monopolies like alibaba, Sohu will grow.
* The intrinsic value is high and some estimates pin it at $10 per share, meaning that the stock has little to no downside given a worst case scenario.
* Sohu received US$1.18 billion in cash from Sogous sale to Tencent, their offices and gaming division is worth more than the company's valuation.
* Game revenues are expected to rise 43% to 53%.

Factors to keep in mind:

* China is a very volatile market, we cannot know exactly what will happen in the future regarding Chinese regulations and more.
* High debt, around 1.4b.

\*This is not financial advice blah blah blah

**Earnings Nov 15**

1,"11/11/2021, 03:09:53",Fairfax (FRFHF) DD *why it's a good value play,Pale-Championship-11,"**Fairfax financial:**

Non-intrinsic value related reasons for undervaluation:

* Boring business model is unappealing in environment of high pace, growth stocks
* Nearly zero interest rates hurting insurance companies
* Uncertainty about whether COVID will result in more insurance losses (especially throughout the world as Fairfax has a major global footprint)

Why its a good long term play: 

* Investment portfolio is about 1/4 of the total portfolio
   * Currently uses a value approach, which, though performing suboptimally in the past, has seen a revival in the pandemic (a buffer against cyclicality)
* Underappreciated at p/e value of around 3, and 80% price per share to book value per share.
* \~94 combined ratio. This means that the company is earning more in premiums than it is paying out in losses + expenses. Very healthy considering FFHs investment income
* If there is high inflation, then higher inflation  high interest rates  help out insurance companies like fairfax financial 
* Not a high growth play (stability + stable \~3% dividend yield) 
* While value investments of Prem Watsa have performed suboptimally in recent years to the pandemic, the pandemic has led the companys value investments to improve substantially to $1.290 billion in Q2 2021. 
* The company recovered to 2019 profit levels but is still undervalued, implying significant upside.
* [Consistent increasing dividend payments](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/TSE/FFH/dividend/) and [share buybacks ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketscreener.com/amp/quote/stock/FAIRFAX-FINANCIAL-HOLDING-1409991/news/Fairfax-Financial-Holdings-Limited-announces-an-Equity-Buyback-for-2-602-760-shares-representing-9-36546959/)(increased nominal dividend by about 30% from 2020  January 2021).

Limitations:

* Lack of a clear catalyst to move the stock price higher
   * It seems like investors are already aware of the increasing dividend and share buybacks (not likely to be a major catalyst)
* Potential for Prem Watsas value investment strategy to falter in the coming years like it did in the past several years.
* Approximately 70% of provisions are IBNR (Incurred but not reported), while only 10% have been paid.

**Valuation**

* Fairfaxs price to tangible book value is **1.24** compared to comparable Canadian insurance Companies **1.78** for Sun Life Financial and **1.14** for Manulife FInancial Corp.
* PE is **4.00**. It is significantly smaller compared to comparable Canadian insurance Companies **12.27** for Sun Life Financial and **6.87** for Manulife FInancial Corp. Source: Google Finance

**Special valuation metric for FFH:**

* The consolidated combined ratio of the insurance and reinsurance operations was 94.3%, producing an underwriting profit of $227.9 million, compared to a combined ratio of 100.4% and an underwriting loss of $13.3 million in 2020, driven by lower COVID-19 losses. The insurance and reinsurance operations experienced growth in net premiums earned of 20.4% and net favourable prior year reserve development of $31.6 million.

Return on equity (ROE) 16.76%

Return on assets (ROA) 3.98%

**Mean Analyst Price target:** USD$ 569.37. Current price (USD 424). The average analyst price targets are consistent with our finding that FFH is undervalued. [Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/TSE/FFH/price-target/)

\*this is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor blah blah blah

1,"11/11/2021, 03:09:26",UGP huge potential,danradu365,"$UGP potential

Gents,

I would like to present you UGP opportunity. This is a brazilian Oil @ Gas company (fourth company in terms of size in Brazil) with investments in fuel &amp; gas distributions (over 7.000 gas stations owned and another 3.000 in franchise), high storage capacity (Ultragaz, Ultracargo), chimicals (Oxiteno). 

Current picture: 
Market cap - 2.5 billion USD 
Share price - 2.3- 2.4 USD Per share, at the level of April 2020 despite the fact that UGP has been profitable all this period (including FY 2020) 

Financials:

P&amp;L: Profitable company with Annual EBITDA - 800 mil USD so very low valuation (3x) for a company of its size (4th in Brazil) and 20% Market share on an emerging Market with approx 200 mil people 

Balance Sheet: aprox 2,3 billion USD debt (3X EBITDA) 

Cash Flow: strong Cash flow (1.2 billion USD Cash in hands) and another 1.3 billion to be cashed from Oxiteno sale (S1 2022). 
Practically, with its cumulated Cash they can cover entirely its debt 

Last days UGP announced an EPS almost double than forecasted one and 54% increase in sales compared with 2020 (which has been a profitable year as well). 

On NOV 09 they just announced a special dividend of 0.1168 USD (5%) beside the semestrial dividends paid already. 

My calculation based on quantitative factors (financials, ratios) and quantitative one (market share, market potential, management) is that such share should be at least 5 USD! Which means more than double than its current level!!!!!! 
The political instability in Brazil should not be linked to UGP as the company has no State ownership like PBR.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr1oyc/ugp_huge_potential/

The question is why exactly, and will it recover? I couldn't really think of a solid reason for the drop, but I think that the combination of a delayed ER and the resignation of their CFO Brian T. Purcell might have spooked the market. Personally, I didn't think much of this when it was released as officers come and go, and this was only his second CFO position. It might be that in the coming days the stock might soar or tank if we get some additional news or rumors about the reason for his departure.

Fellow retards, I posted about [$BBBY Shorts were caught with their pants down???](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlek68/bbby_shorts_were_caught_with_their_pants_down/) on November 02 and $BBBY went from $16 to $35 in AH . Sadly, $BBBY went back to $18 five days ago, and a lot of retards were caught holding bags at $30 ++. Well.. here is some good news for you. I DO NOT THINK THIS IS OVER. 

Guess who bought the fucking dips? 

**EVP, CFO of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc** ([30-Year Financial](https://www.gurufocus.com/financials/BBBY), [Insider Trades](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/BBBY/insider)) [Gustavo Arnal](https://www.gurufocus.com/insider/Arnal+Gustavo/name) ([insider trades](https://www.gurufocus.com/insider/Arnal+Gustavo/name)) bought **12,500 shares of BBBY** on 11/08/2021 at an average price of $**20.44 a share**. The total cost of this purchase was $255,500. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**John Fleming**, at **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond** (NASDAQ:[BBBY](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BBBY#NASDAQ)), made a large insider buy on November 5, according to a new SEC filing.

**What Happened:** A Form 4 filing from the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000114036121037282/xslF345X03/form4.xml) on Friday showed that **Fleming purchased 15,000 shares** of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond at at a price of **$19.00**. The total transaction amounted to $285,000.

[Fleming](https://benzinga.com/sec/insider-trades/bbby/john-fleming) now owns a total of 51,587 of **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond** worth, 1,107,314.

Well..... Who the fuck is John Fleming?

John E. Fleming is on the board of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Inc. and 6 other companies. In his past career he was Chief Merchandising Officer &amp; Executive VP at Walmart, Inc., Group Executive Officer &amp; CEO-Global eCommerce at FAST RETAILING CO., LTD. and Chief Executive Officer-Global eCommerce at Uniqlo Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of FAST RETAILING CO., LTD.), Senior Vice President-Merchandising at Target Corp. and Chief Marketing Officer at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

You read that right, Mr. Fleming is not an autist like you and I. A**n insider buying up 15,000 shares at $19.00** when the stock spiked from $14.00 to $30++. He could have just waited for it to dip back to $14 but he didn't. He bought them shares like a degenerate that he is. Why? Because he knows SHORTS are fucked too. Their pants are still down.  Or do we want to talk about the **CFO bought 12,500 shares at $20.44????** 

Look at this fucking chart. Do you see a familiar pattern here ? I believe we are still in the early stage of the squeeze. Yes, you heard that fucking right. 

"" ***High Short Interest***: Of Bed Bath &amp; Beyonds 45.5 million share float, 26.81 million shares, meaning about 58.93%, are held short. The number has increased from 22.04 million in September. ""

[Analysis ](https://preview.redd.it/ptzd35q0aty71.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d6606ee3c04745b107dca01dcf2277bdb9d5af3)

I am coming up with a third DD to show you retards that Shorts were shorting this stock at $14, thinking it that it will go below $10. What happened when the price went  to $30? Shorts went panic, but they doubled down. FOMO and insiders pumped the stock price to $30. A lot of bag holders saw a glimpse of heaven and they sold, tanking the price back to $18. Well, I believe shorts will cover soon, which will definitely send the price higher than $30. 

You can find my [Position](https://preview.redd.it/it0ioj5529x71.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67f17ad971b39bcedc989c999edf89726fcf15f) in the old post: [BBBY](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlek68/bbby_shorts_were_caught_with_their_pants_down/)

Finally, here's what Citron Research said about BBBY. They clearly learned their lesson getting fucked by $GME back in those days and decide to switch side. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**""On November 2, $BBBY announced that it was accelerating its $1 billion three-year share repurchase program to now be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. The last time we saw a buyback this aggressive and bullish was from Citron favorite RH when the co. announced a $700 million buyback authorization in May 2017 when the stock was trading at $52. Two months later, RH completed the buyback and you know the rest of the story. (RH is at**  $ 636.69  today) 

There are clear parallels from this aggressive move by $BBBY with $RH four years ago.

1. Management and the BOD believe the stock is highly undervalued
2. This aggressive buyback shows there are no liquidity concerns
3. The shareholder structure is more concentrated than the market appreciates (e.g., 42% of $BBBY shares outstanding are held by the top 3 holders BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard)

**Analysts and investors can see in the latest $BBBY 10-Q filing that the company has completed the initial $600 million tranche of this buyback at an average price of $25 while repurchasing stock in tranches as high as $29 (i.e., 50% higher).**

No one knows the intrinsic value of this company more than this board same $RH argument and they believe the stock is undervalued even at $29.

Applying a 5x EBITDA multiple on 2024 EBITDA of $800 million to $1 billion **we arrive at a price target of $50 to $70,** so can see why management sees value here.""

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, one last paragraph about why BBBY is still undervalued.

Here is what Miller Value Partners has to say about Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. in its Q3 2021 investor letter:

&gt;*""Our largest laggard during the quarter was Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY). As we have highlighted previously, not all transformations are linear and there is always the potential for a short-term pullback in executing the plan. We expect the operational pause will lead to marketplace skepticism and question the success of the long-term plan. The company has had some near-term challenges from weaker store traffic related to Covid-19 delta variants impact along with rising supply chain and transportation costs. However, we disagree with the marketplace view that these headwinds will continue to overwhelm the significant ongoing improvements that management is making to the core operations. We very much like the new CEO and his additions to his management team  strong executives with significant transformation experience. As the new initiatives further rollout over the coming quarters, we expect to see further improvement in future operating trends. Management is in the process of rolling out 8-10 owned brands, which should drive margin expansion and dramatically enhance the overall business model. Store brands are 1,000 basis points higher gross margin than national brands, and as they move from 10% to 30% of sales, they should become a significant positive profit contributor and help management achieve their long-term gross margin target of 38%. Bed Bath also continues to have a very strong balance sheet ($10/share in cash), and has been using non-core asset sales to complete a very accretive share buyback program (likely greater than 20% of the float by year-end). With the recent pullback, we see some similarities to GameStop early in their turnaround as the company aggressively reduced their shares outstanding (&gt;30%) ahead of revenue stability and profit improvement. We believe success on Bed Baths transformation plan should see profits double over the next couple of years and should lead to significantly higher normalized earnings and free cash flow per share. At an enterprise value to revenue under .2x,* ***we believe Bed Bath remains at a significant discount to its intrinsic value.""***",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr19gc/bbby_shorts_are_caught_with_their_pants_down_part/

1,"11/11/2021, 02:46:44","My Magnum Opus: The only investment you can bolster by jerkin it - CryoPort, Inc. (CYRX)",TheFleshGordon,"Random internet strangers, I write to you today bearing gifts.  While most of you have been trying to make plays on electric vehicles or the latest meme, I have been in the background searching for the greatest investment ever.  What I have found is \[CryoPort, Inc.\]([https://www.cryoport.com](https://www.cryoport.com))

&amp;#x200B;

First a little background, CryoPort is listed as **CYRX**.  According to the company, Cryoport, Inc., is a ""*life sciences*"" company. They provide temperature-controlled logistics solutions. They serve three main industries, Biopharmaceutical, Animal Health and IVF services under ""CryoStork"".

&amp;#x200B;

While you might be assuming I want to tell you about is the Biopharmaceutical services, as Animal Health is more of a niche and IVF can't be that big, you my simple reader are wrong. The reason CryoPort is going to take off is due to IVF and CryoStork. Lets take a look together at the only two points we care about:

1. What is CryoStork

2. Why is it going to hulk dick?

&amp;#x200B;

At this point you may be questioning, ""Flesh, what the hell is CryoPort? And why have I even read this far?""

Answer: You probably should have stopped reading this far, but now that I know that its just the boys, The real answer is **Semen**.  Yup you read correctly, sperm, jizz, spooge, baby batter, man chowder, cum, trouser gravy. Hopefully I have peaked your interest and you read on to point 1,

&amp;#x200B;

**What is CryoStork?**

According to their \[website\]([https://mycryostork.com](https://mycryostork.com)) ""*Cryoport is proud to provide you and your family our exclusive CryoStork IVF shipping services to ensure your* ***precious reproductive materials*** *are handled with care from clinic to clinic, safely and securely.*"" While they don't come right out and say it, ""**Precious reproductive materials**"" only means two things eggs, and boneless children.  CryoPort utilizes ""*cold chain logistics solutions for temperature-sensitive life sciences materials*"" and has three advantages over the competition:

1. Cryoport Express Shippers - Proprietary modifications to shippers that are""*scientifically engineered to ensure your precious materials are transported safely and securely. Our lightweight shippers feature a combination of advanced packaging, cryogenics and high-vacuum technology,allowing for a hold time of up to 10 days.*""

2. Cryoportal which is their logistics management platform which they use to monitor #3

3. Smartpak II a leading-edge condition monitoring system that ""*provides our team visibility on the conditions of your valuable IVF materials throughout the entire shipping process by monitoring location, pressure, orientation, temperature, tampering, shock and humidity.*

Basically this is high class limousine service for your spunk.  Which leads us to point 2,

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is it going to hulk dick?**

According to a research report by some Lord of the Rings firm that I was unwilling to purchase, ""The sperm bank market is expected to record a **CAGR of 3.3%** between 2021 and 2026."" Another book report on semen storage projects a **CAGR of 5.2%.** Now this might not seem like anything crazy but the sperm bank market was 4.7 billion in 2019.  So we are talking about a decent increase in the near future.

While CryoPort is not a sperm bank, someone needs to move the mountains of man milk from place to place. So any increase in infertility, IVF, or donations will increase the shipping needs. This raises the questions, is infertility rising? Are IVF treatments increasing? Are more dudes donating their homemade protein?

&amp;#x200B;

Don't you worry baby birds, I'll feed you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Infertility**:

According to the CDC: ""The provisional **number of births** for the United States in 2019 was 3,745,540, down 1% from the number in 2018 (3,791,712). This is the fifth year that the number of births has declined after the increase in 2014, down an average of 1% per year, and the lowest number of births since 1985.""

Infertility is a growing issue for many females. Infertility affects**6.1 million American females** (approximately 10% of American females of childbearing age).

* The current increase in infertility might be the result of more womenchoosing to delay starting a family until later in life when theirreproductive health can be affected.
* Or it could be due to STDs like the Clap which can result in conditionssuch as blocked tubes, preventing pregnancy from occurring.

&amp;#x200B;

**Infertility Services**:

https://preview.redd.it/81rigx9mcty71.jpg?width=2056&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbadd401fc452f88059181d28e50b01f8b3061b1

https://preview.redd.it/7ivtoweocty71.jpg?width=2012&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c63b853ed2a3313e606a66f8169c4a63f0fbebb1

We know Infertility Services are increasing and Infertility issues are also on the rise.  Throw in COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain issues and the Sperm shipping industry was hardened and backed up, some might even say blue-balled.  With the supply chain issues starting to decrease and more nations coming out of lockdown, the need for seed has never been greater.  You can invest in CryoPort and then go donate at your local sperm bank to replenish the supply.

1,"11/11/2021, 01:24:44",Highest CPI since 1990 (6.2%),NNT888,"This is an internal document that I obtained and thought it'd be helpful to share here with you retards. It might or might not relevant to whatever play you're on, but it's a good read. Some of the below information below may also be published somewhere for the public to see.

Inflation was high in October and broad-based. Supply chain issues remain more intense and persistent than expected, putting particular pressure on the price of goods. CPI rose 0.94% in October, significantly above the 0.6% consensus, for a 6.2% year-on-year increase (not seasonally adjusted). Core CPI (excluding food and energy) rose 0.60%, above the 0.4% consensus, for a 4.6% year-on-year increase. These were the highest year-on-year readings for the headline index since 1990 and the core index since 1991. Energy prices rose 30% in the last 12 months.

Prices for core goods rose 1.0% on the month after a 0.2% increase in September, and core services prices rose 0.4% after a 0.2% increase the previous month. This shows the bulk of October price increases came not from people shifting back to services as Delta waned, but rather supply bottlenecks interacting with a rush to stock up on holiday shopping. Additionally, the lingering microchip shortage continues to put pressure on auto prices. Prices for used cars and trucks rose 2.5%, back in the spotlight after the wholesale price index reached a new high in October. New cars and trucks rose 1.4%, and car and truck rental rose 3.1%.

Earlier this summer, we predicted bottlenecks would hold back production and increase price pressures, it was just a question of when. October was that month. Some of the dominant issues like warehousing, the microchip shortage, or port congestion arent going to fully resolve in the next few months. But energy prices are showing signs of plateauing, the Baltic Dry shipping index has fallen significantly since an early-October peak, and strong payrolls momentum will increase production capacity.

The spread of the Delta variant muted demand and thus price pressures in specific pandemic-sensitive sectors of the economy in August and September. October was a mixed bag in this respect, as virus cases came down from their peak but remained elevated. Prices for food away from home accelerated but not as much as for food at home. Prices for lodging away from home accelerated but airfare prices declined.

Shelter prices make up a third of the CPI basket and had big increases in September. Theyre considered less sensitive to reopening and the pandemic so any acceleration here has been more concerning than other components when it comes to short-term interest rates. OER (Owners Equivalent Rent) rose 0.4% for the second straight month and rent of primary residence rose 0.4% after a 0.5% increase in September. These are still elevated monthly gains compared to normal.

- Airfares declined 0.7%
- Energy prices rose 4.8% after a 1.3% increase in September.
- Gasoline prices rose 6.1% for the fifth consecutive monthly increase
- Food prices overall rose 0.9% for the second straight month
- Lodging away from home rose 1.4% after a 0.6% decrease in September.
- Medical care services rose 0.5%, the largest increase since May of last year.
 
Bottom line: Its hard to ignore the highest year-on-year CPI since 1990 after downward momentum in monthly price changes. The pressures are broad-based but most focused on sectors dealing with particularly tough supply chain issues and a surge in demand from the lead-up to the holiday season. Well see one more CPI report before the December FOMC meeting, but this report is the latest test for the Feds patience in explaining high inflation as transitory. How long is too long to wait, and what new issues might emerge that keep inflation high? One month does not make a trend, but October CPI throws a wrench in the last few months of price data showing cooling inflation. Even with cooling monthly increases, year-on-year readings will remain high well into next year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqzeph/highest_cpi_since_1990_62/

Snippets:

3rd Quarter Financials

* To begin in the 3nd quarter, Senseonics generated $3.5 million of revenue. This included $0.6 million from the U.S. and $2.9 million from outside the U.S. wherever the larger installed base. Commercially in the U.S., Senseonics has been re-engaging healthcare providers who prescribed an insert ever since to support current patients and to add new users in those clinics. 
*  The Q3 results reflect the full transition of commercial activities in the U.S. and to you, to our partner of Ascensia. In the third quarter of 2021, total net revenue was $3.5 million compared to $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2020. U.S. revenue for the third quarter was $0.6 million and revenue outside the U.S. was $2.9 million. Gross loss in Q3 2021 was $1.2 million, a decrease of $2 million from gross profit of $0.8 million in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was predominantly related to the increase in cost of goods sold due to impairment charges and write-offs on inventory and related assets of current generation products with potential expert concerns. Third quarter 2021 sales and marketing expenses were $2.5 million. A decrease of $0.7 million compared to $3.2 million in the prior-year period. 
*  The decrease was primarily the result of a decline in salary and personnel costs from the reduction in sales support, due to the transition to Ascensia for the commercialization of Eversense, offset by an increase in general advertising related to the shared support of the commercialization of the 90-day product in the U.S. Research and development expenses in Q3, 2021, were $7.2 million, an increase of $2.6 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of our R&amp;D headcount, an increase in clinical studies and lab supplies, and an increase in contractor expenses. General and administrative expenses in Q3 2021 were $5.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million compared to $5.5 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower professional fees. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2021, operating loss was $16 million, compared to $12.5 million, a loss in the third quarter of 2020. 
*  Each quarter, the value of these non-cash gains or losses will vary based on the volatility in the Company's share price. So generally, as share price increases, we incurred a non-cash loss and a share price decreases, we recognized a non-cash gain. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2021, total net income was $42.9 million or $0.10 per share. Compared to a net loss of $23.4 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Net income increased by $66.3 million due to the accounting for embedded derivatives and fair value adjustment previously mentioned 
*  Year-to-date, our net cash used in operating activities was approximately $44.3 million. As of September 30, 2021, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments totaled $201.1 million. In the third quarter, we began to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest on our PBP loan without penalty. We continue to pay the interest on the PHC notes in cash instead of using the payment kind or pick option. Paying the interest in cash continues to reduce shareholder dilution due to the lower share conversion price associated with the terms of the payment in kind agreement. 
*  Lastly, looking at the remainder of the year, we currently expect global net revenue to Senseonics for the full-year 2021 to be right in the middle of the previously stated revenue guidance range of 12 to $15 million. We also continue to expect full-year 2021 net cash used in operations to be in the range of $60 to $65 million. 

Senseonics pilot programs

*  In addition, we are also in the final stages of planning and seeking to implement additional pilot programs to support expanded access to Eversense. As an example, we are working to establish a pilot program with a mobile healthcare provider, which would provide an in-home insertion option for Eversence users.  We hope to pilot this innovative approach to sensor delivery in a limited region within the coming weeks, with the goals of expanding it to additional markets next year.   
 This is great because this will allow Eversense users to have the ability for a mobile technician to served their sensor in their homes.

180 day FDA approval on track

*  On the innovation front, we are excited to be approaching our major release of our next-generation product in the U.S. with the FDA clearance of our 180 day sensor, which we believe remains on track to occur later this quarter. In the third quarter, we have been actively engaging with and responding to requests for clarifying Information from the agency. We are pleased to be nearing the completion of the interactive review process and are excited about the potential and bringing this transformative product to people with diabetes. The FDA has been a great partner in these difficult times and they are highly engaged and focused on completing this review in its final stages, if there are no other unexpected additional impacts as a result of COVID delays or any other factor at the agency, we continue to expect approval by the end of this year. 

After FDA approval of the 180day, they will begin testing of the 365 day system

*  We do continue to expect the formal pivotal trial will be initiated in the first half of next year and would form the basis of the clinical data that we would submit to the agency for commercialization approval in the future. Products like the Plan 365-day Eversense system is something that our patients in the diabetes market is extremely excited about because of the transformation that it would represent in managing the burden of diabetes and providing ultimate freedom to our users.

I know nothing is guaranteed and I could just as easily end up losing money, but Im willing to YOLO it. What should my strategy be in order to achieve my desired goal, if its even possible?

1,"11/11/2021, 00:42:16","CLNE: Ignore the vol and Keep your eyes focused on upcoming catalysts; expect COP26 war on methane noise to remain high as governments turn words to action, AMZN deploys 2700 RNG trucks and CLNE announces new dairy upstream projects",Disasterdujour888,"Volatility yesterday morning and again today but after the run a little consolidation is healthy. 

The pullback was bought yesterday. Good to see that investors are staying focused on the long term investment case (we are only at the very start of this 10 year+ RNG journey) and there are some key stock catalysts coming up:

1) COP26 action: world leaders have just spent the last week pontificating how bad methane is, how we need to do more to capture it, how dairies landfills and wastewater is all contributing more than we realize blah blah blah. Well after all the big talk government will have to actually act and do something. So expect some announcements in the upcoming weeks as countries move towards action. In the US the infra bill is now passed and Biden has already pledged implicitly that alternative fuels are part of the official US energy plan. We just need to see explicit details on how RNG will benefit directly. More news to come. Its just a matter of time. 

2) CLNE mentioned that various states are already preparing their own legislative initiatives to move in the direction of CA. Basically create support initiatives to incentivize clean fuel adoption at the state level which would include RNG. Lets see what happens but I welcome discussion of RNG in state politics. New York is expected to lead the way; other states usually follow. CLNE appears to be involved in some of these state efforts FYI which makes sense as they are a key stakeholder. 

3) AMZN was referred to as anchor customer on CLNEs call last week. They are basically the customer that broke the chicken vs egg conundrum that CLNE needed to solve. You cant invest in RNG upstream production unless you know you can offload it; but nobody wants to commit to RNG trucking fleets if they do not know how to get the RNG fuel when and where they need it. Bottom line AMZN is confirmed fully committed to RNG if that was not already clear from their recently published sustainability report. And D Day for rollout and full deployment of 2700 RNG is early 2022. These are heavy duty trucks with Cummins engines. Once the full AMZN fleet is deployed 2700 RNG trucks will be criss crossing the US and that alone equates to about 40mm gallons of RNG demand or 40 percent of the current gallons of RNG CNG LNG passing through CLNEs infrastructure per quarter. Confirmation that AMZN is fully deployed should be an important milestone (and of course it will
be reflected in Q1 earnings). 

4) CLNE this Q talked about the AMZN effect - basically when other big operators see what AMZN is doing (deploying 2700 RNG trucks) they get FOMO and jump in because they do not want to be seen as unsustainable or behind the curve. CLNE would not have said this unless they have had inquiries. They cant name names but Another big customer win would be huge. 

5) New cummins engine is a game changer and we will Hear more about it as cummins doubles down on its anti-diesel initiatives. The availability of this truck should make switch to RNG engines more compelling for trucking fleets because it delivers extra power that older engines lacked. This is important. If trucking fleets do not trust the RNG equipment to meet performance specs they obviously wont spend the capex. But power difference is no longer an excuse vs diesel engines. From a sustainability angle they are Certified 90pct cleaner than diesel! So expectation is we are going to see RNG engine commitments roll in and We need to keep a close eye on Cummins updates on RNG engine sales which will be leading indicator of fuel demand. Good news is that so far interest in the new engines has exceeded cummins own expectations and Cummins has never been more bullish on adoption of RNG. Any more news from Cummins will be a catalyst for CLNE. 

6) Without committed demand for RNG you can not commit to capex heavy RNG production. This is the chicken vs egg conundrum. But the demand is there (again AMZN = anchor) so CLNE and its upstream partners are going full throttle on building its proprietary RNG supply base. CLNE already has 4 projects in midwest via BP. Next week it will be initiating one big project in Taxes with Total. And then soon to be announced is a deal with one of americas largest dairy farms in Idaho (2nd largest) to begin producing millions of gallons of negative carbon RNG per year. Thats the quote. CLNE cant say more but you can tell this one is big. It also sounds like this project can scale up even further over time because the dairy farms is going to add tens of thousands of additional cow heads over time. Its already the 2nd biggest dairy farm but it will grow dramatically which means more RNG. CLNE is going to have to make some public announcements about this project in the upcoming weeks. Its material and signals major shift in the dairy industry. Any announcement and fanfare around this project would be a great catalyst supporting the upstream side of the RNG story. 

7) CLNE has never been great about giving investors specific numbers. Investors need clarity and guidance but CLNE has found it difficult to articulate their growth in numbers because there have been too many moving pieces. That has been a problem and one of the shortcomings of Littlefair and his management team to date. But that is about to change.  CLNE hinted that they will be providing some updated numbers soon. What we know today is that CLNE and its partners BP and Total have approx 10-25mm gallons of RNG Production in their proprietary pipeline coming in at various stages in the next 18-24 months+. This number is as of TODAY. various projects are being identified and negotiated as we speak including the big dairy project mentioned above so This number is going up. Any new projects will only increase this number and with some Big projects in the works the jump could be meaningful. Stay tuned for the big announcement.

Ive been reading about index funds, looked at some of them and their average return which is somewhere between 10% and 20% and tried out a calculator so see how much my investment would grow with these returns.

My question is, when using these calculators the money growth is shown by year and each year the years growth percentage is applied. Lets say I invest 100$ and hold it for 1 year for 10% Ill have 110$ right? After 10 years if the growth of the fund was 10% in total (lets say from 10$ to 11$) then isnt my investment still just 110$ worth? Using the calculators, the percentage is applied every year so it shows 259$. 

Why is percentage applied each year? Wouldnt that only happen if I would sell everything and reinvest everything or something like that?

Hope someone can clarify or point me to a good source that explains how exactly the investment grows.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqyfyd/basic_question_about_returns/

1,"11/11/2021, 00:18:28",$UPH Into Earnings Tonight,Quiet_Spite_3221,"Article on Seeking Alpha highlighting $UPH into earnings tonight.

The big question here is whether the stock price represents fundamental problems or technicals from a badly botched de-spac. If it's the latter, and the author presents that case, then this has major multi-bag potential going into earnings tonight. This was a $5 stock before collapsing in a nasty secondary offering they did to patch up the damage from the SPAC sponsor's mess. But the underlying business is growing fast, EBITDA profitable, and trades around just 1x 2022 sales. At just 4x sales you are looking at a stock price over 300% higher. Looks like a lot of asymmetry into tonight and Chris Demuth who is involved has a great SPAC record.

You can go for the big win positioning into earnings or wait until the close to see how things go. If they don't retract that 2022 guidance or even just adjust it down a small amount on the call/release then this could recover to that $5 pre-secondary level in a heartbeat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqxyag/uph_into_earnings_tonight/

the last time they announced a price raise the stock price went up roughly 25% over the course of 3 days, the price raise in September paid off so well that they decided to raise again. In terms of technical analysis we broke out and are backtesting, if we rebound here we should head to the channels breakout target which is around $16, as for my positions I had $100 left in cash after losing all my money on other trades so I bought more 15c on the IV crush, this isnt magic beans or some miracle stock so I dont expect to see it moon in one day. the average price for me became $28 cuz i bought super cheap and was up about 100% on todays peak but im holding until at least $17

In total I have 10 contracts expiring next week with $15 strike, Im feeling optimistic especially since they are raising prices again, they stated that consumers are willing to pay 50% more for the specialty donuts so the price hikes can go a long way in terms of investing in shares but im here just betting on short term price action. A smart person would wait till closure before buying a closure above 14.15 would be the proper bullish confirmation here in terms of technical analysis on the larger frames. I think it can run 25-50% but I would def cash out at $20 with some profit taking at $17.

Also, the profile of their rockets and launch platforms effectively makes them ballistic missiles, if ever needed. Fitting in a standard container is a large bonus for flexible and hidden deployment.
